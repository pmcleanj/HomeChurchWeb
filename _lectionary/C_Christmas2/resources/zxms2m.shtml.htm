<b>Sirach</b>
</small><p>
<small>Sirach is also known as Sira and Ecclesiasticus, probably meaning church 
book, an indication that it was used by the early Christian community. It is 
in the Apocrypha of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible, and is 
considered deutero-canonical by Roman Catholics. Adherents to Judaism 
excluded it from the Bible, as did the Protestant Reformers. We know 
(from 50:27) that Jesus ben Sira, a native of Jerusalem, wrote it. 
Ben Sira ran a school in biblical studies for young Jewish men. 
Written about 180 BC, it is faithful to the author's Jewish heritage and 
tradition and makes use of ideas from other cultures where they are 
compatible with his heritage.

<strong>Sirach 24:1-12</strong>
<p>To followers of Judaism, the created world is God&#8217;s, so faith and
reason go hand in hand; learning about creation is learning about God;
reasoning is done in the context of God. They and we seek knowledge of
God as we pursue faith. In the last centuries BC, people saw that the
acquisition of knowledge about God led to wisdom. The author of Sirach,
Jesus ben Sira, understood wisdom as leading to prosperity. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+1%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1:1</a>
says: &#8220;all wisdom is from the Lord ...&#8221;. In our reading, ben Sira, has
wisdom (abstracted, personified &#8211; but in a metaphorical way) introduce
herself &#8220;in the midst of her people&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>), Israel.

permeated the earth (&#8220;like a mist&#8221;) as the spirit of God. She existed before creation. (Genesis

<b>Jeremiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born or began his ministry 
in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded Assyria as the dominant 
power in the Middle East. He was a witness to the return to worship of the 
Lord (instituted by the Judean king Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death 
in battle in 609), the return of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon 
captured Jerusalem in 587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be 
a prophet to Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political 
and religious convulsions.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Jeremiah 31:7-14</strong>
<p>Jeremiah probably wrote this message of hope about 600 BC. Most of
his book is directed to the people of Judah (the southern kingdom,
conquered by Babylon in 587 BC) but this passage is directed to Israel,
the northern kingdom, which was at the time loosely subject to Assyrian
rule. Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A7-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7-8</a> are a call for celebration. 
&#8220;Jacob&#8221; refers to Israel; the &#8220;chief of the nations&#8221; means the <em>foremost</em>: Israel is paramount because God cares about it. The &#8220;land of the north&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>)
is Assyria. The people &#8211; even the &#8220;blind and the lame&#8221; &#8211; will be
gathered together, and will return from exile. (They were deported in
722 BC.) Such a caravan crossing the Arabian desert will indeed be a
miraculous event.</p>
<p>Joy will be mixed with &#8220;weeping&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>)
and compassion (&#8220;consolations&#8221;). God will &#8220;lead them back&#8221;, but (unlike
in the first Exodus), the going will be easy. Back then water was in
short supply (recall that God caused water to spring forth from a rock
&#8211; Exodus 17:1-7), but this time &#8220;brooks&#8221; will provide plentifully.
Being Israel&#8217;s father, God will restore the nation to the state already
enjoyed by Judah. (&#8220;Ephraim&#8221; is part of Israel.) Other nations,
including the &#8220;coastlands&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>) of the Mediterranean, 
are invited to witness this marvellous happening. In the first Exodus, God rescued Israel (&#8220;ransomed Jacob&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>) and defeated their enemies 
(&#8220;hands too strong&#8221;); he will do so again. When they return, they will celebrate God&#8217;s goodness with feasting (v.

Per v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>, the priests will have 
life and prosperity (&#8220;fatness&#8221;) as will all &#8220;my people&#8221;. Bountiful harvests will mark the start of this new era of well-being.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>Wisdom</b>
</small><p>
<small>Wisdom has been a book of the church since the earliest times. For some 
Christians, it is part of the Apocrypha ("hidden books"); for others, 
it is in the Old Testament. Until this book was written (about 50 BC), 
the best that could be hoped for when one died was to exist in some 
inderterminate state. Wisdom tells us that being made in the image of 
God includes sharing with him in immortality. Only the godly, the 
ethical, will be granted eternal life; those who choose to deviate 
from God's ways will be punished and will disappear into nothingness.

the author says that wisdom has been God&#8217;s agent in saving some
important people in the past. Wisdom was also active in saving the
people of Israel, through Moses. They are &#8220;blameless&#8221; in that they are
chosen and set apart by God.

<b>Ephesians</b>
</small><p>
<small>This letter of Paul was written from prison, probably in Rome. Whilst 
the Bible states that it was written to the church at Ephesus, the some 
early manuscripts do not contain an addressee in 1:1. This would imply 
that Ephesians was a circular letter, sent to a number of churches. If 
so, it introduced a new idea into letter writing: we know of no other 
circular letters from this period. This book celebrates the life of the 
church, a unique community established by God through the work of Jesus 
Christ, who is its head, and also the head of the whole creation.

rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 1:(1-9),10-18</strong>
<p>Our reading is the continuation of the book&#8217;s prologue, or the whole
prologue. The Word, God, Christ, has been born into this imperfect
world &#8211; a world that per v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>, &#8220;came into being through 
him&#8221; &#8211; but most people did not embrace him as who he is. (To <em>know</em>,
to a Semite, involves personal commitment as well as awareness.) He
came to Israel, but its people generally rejected him, but some did
receive him for who he is; some became committed to him. (To <em>know someone&#8217;s name</em> meant more than it does today.) These received the power to be adopted as sons and daughters of God: they were <em>reborn</em> into God&#8217;s family, through the Holy Spirit 
(&#8220;of God&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Flesh&#8221;, humanity, per Isaiah 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+40%3A6-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">40:6-8</a>,
was seen as weak, imperfect and transitory. Christ does an amazing
thing: he becomes a human being (albeit, being God, a perfect one). The
author is a witness to the divine presence shown in Jesus (&#8220;glory&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>). John the Baptizer was the first 
of this gospel&#8217;s witnesses of the <em>Christ-event</em>, God become human.</p>
<p>From all that is in God (&#8220;fullness&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>),
we have received gift after gift (&#8220;grace upon grace&#8221;). The Mosaic Law
was given by God, and Christ brought the full revelation of God&#8217;s ways.
Judaism said that God could not be seen (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>). (Even Moses, in Exodus 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A30-44" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">33:30-44</a>,
was not permitted to see God&#8217;s face.) It is through Christ, who is in
complete intimacy with the Father, that we have been given access to
the Father.</p>
