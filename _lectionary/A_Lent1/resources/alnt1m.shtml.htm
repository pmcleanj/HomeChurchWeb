<b>Genesis</b>
</a></small><p>
<small><a name="Genesis">Genesis is the first book of the Bible. It begins with two versions of the 
creation story, neither of them intended to be scientific but telling us why 
we are on earth. In the story of Adam and Eve, it tells us that we are 
responsible, under God, for the care of all creation. It then continues with 
the stories of the patriarchs: Abraham (who enters into a covenant (or treaty) 
with God), Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.

<strong>Genesis 2:15-17;3:1-7</strong>
<p>Our reading is excerpts from an epic tale about the creation of
humanity, beginning from after the creation of &#8220;the heavens and the
earth&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:4</a>),
a time when the earth was semi-arid. Ancient peoples thought that there
were waters under the earth. Seepage of this water was insufficient for
cultivation; as yet there was no rain and &#8220;no one to till the ground&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:5</a>). At that time, God formed 
<em>human</em> (Hebrew: <em>adam</em>) &#8220;from the dust of the ground&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:7</a>) and gave him his spirit of 
life. God put <em>human</em> (as yet androgynous) in Eden 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:8</a>), his earthly domain, to 
cultivate and care for it. God tells him he may eat the fruit of the trees there, except for two: </p>
<ls>
<li>that of &#8220;the knowledge of good and evil&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:17</a>), of complete knowledge and 
understanding (or of moral choice); and </li>
<li>that of &#8220;life&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:9</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:3</a>), of eternal life, of becoming 
divine.</li>
</ls>
<p> If he does, he will &#8220;die&#8221;, i.e. be separated from God. God provides <em>human</em> with an equal &#8220;partner&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:18</a>) of <em>human&#8217;s</em> 
flesh. Thus the tale explains sex, of &#8220;Man&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+2%3A23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:23</a>, Hebrew: <em>ish</em>) and 
&#8220;Woman&#8221; (<em>isha</em>).</p>
<p>At this point, the couple do not see shame in nudity, for their
relationship to God is guiltless. Now the snake, a mischievous
creature, (also a character in other ancient epics) appears. He sows
doubt in the woman&#8217;s mind about what God has commanded, and she
responds inaccurately (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:2</a>): she adds &#8220;nor shall 
you touch it&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:3</a>). The 
snake suggests that God is trying to fool her: rather than <em>dying</em>, she will attain mastery of knowledge, and become divine (&#8220;like God&#8221;, 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:5</a>).
She finds this irresistible; she eats of its fruit and gives some to
the man. Nudity is now embarrassing, for the couple has lost its
innocent trusting relationship with God (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:8</a>). In 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A8-19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:8-19</a> God metes out punishment 
for disobeying his order: </p>
<ls>
<li>to the snake: it will lack legs and eat dust; </li>
<li>to the woman: (a) despite the great pain of child-bearing, she will
seek to bear more children; (b) (in an ancient society) man &#8220;shall rule
over you&#8221;; </li>
<li>to the man: (a) cultivation will be labourious; (b) he will die, returning to &#8220;dust&#8221;; and </li>
<li>to all three: humans and snakes will be enemies.</li>
</ls>
<p> Thus are explained some basic facts of life. But sin has not changed God&#8217;s intent: Eve is &#8220;mother of all living&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:20</a>) and God protects the couple 
by making &#8220;garments&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+3%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:21</a>) for them. To protect them 
from exceeding human limitations and becoming like gods, he expels them from Eden, into the ordinary world.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 32</strong>
<p>The psalmist tells us what he has learned in life: happiness is
having one&#8217;s sin forgiven and taken away (&#8220;covered&#8221;) by God, and
enjoying a clear conscience (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+32%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). In vv.

he states his experiences: he was seriously ill (&#8220;your hand was heavy
upon me&#8221;) and was in pain (&#8220;groaning&#8221;), both signs of his alienation
from God. (Illness was commonly regarded as punishment for sin.) He
acknowledged his sin and did not continue his waywardness (&#8220;I did not
hide ...&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+32%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>); he confessed to God, and God

<b>Romans</b>
</small><p>
<small>Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

<hr>
<strong>Romans 5:12-19</strong>
<p>Paul has said that Christians, reconciled to God, will be saved,
sharing in the risen life of Christ. Two notions are important here: </p>
<ls>
<li>the punishment for Adam&#8217;s sin was to die both physically and spiritually (&#8220;death came through sin&#8221;); and </li>
<li>we both sin ourselves and share in his sin (&#8220;spread to all&#8221;).</li>
</ls>
<p> Paul contrasts Adam and Christ, both inaugurators of eras. Adam foreshadowed Christ as head of humanity (&#8220;type&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+5%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>, precursor). Adam disobeyed 
God&#8217;s direct command (&#8220;the transgression&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+5%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>, &#8220;the trespass&#8221;, v.

i.e. Christ, is unlike Adam&#8217;s sin: </p>
<ls>
<li>&#8220;many died&#8221; before Christ&#8217;s coming but even more so are &#8220;many&#8221; (indeed all) saved through Christ; </li>
<li>Adam was condemned to separation from God but Christ brings union with God (vv.

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

The disciples probably knew none of the details of Jesus&#8217; trial, for
temptation is essentially a personal inner battle with one&#8217;s
conscience. &#8220;Forty days&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+4%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>)
reminds us of Moses and Elijah, both of whom also fasted for forty days
as they prepared for their roles as God&#8217;s agents to Israel &#8211; as does
Jesus. All three of the temptations the Devil (&#8220;the tempter&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+4%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>, &#8220;Satan&#8221;, v.

sinning against the great commandment in Deuteronomy

Lord your God with all your heart, ... soul, and ... might.&#8221;. The &#8220;heart&#8221; was the seat of will, of moral choice; &#8220;soul&#8221; means <em>life</em>; &#8220;might&#8221; means possessions. (All Jesus&#8217; answers are from 
Deuteronomy <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+6-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6-8</a>.) To change

bread would be rebellion against divine will: God made stones stones and bread bread. Jesus says that the &#8220;word&#8221; (v.

The &#8220;holy city&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+4%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
is Jerusalem; a &#8220;pinnacle&#8221; probably overlooked the temple courts and
the deep Kidron Valley. Jesus answers: testing God&#8217;s protection by
unnecessarily risking life is a mockery of real martyrdom &#8211; and of his
sacrifice to come (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+4%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>). The Devil, evil forces 
personified, invites Jesus to prefer personal wealth and power over love of God (vv.

only god to be worshipped and served (v.

that Jesus is the perfect lover of God, the ideal Israelite, the founder of a new way of being human.</p>
