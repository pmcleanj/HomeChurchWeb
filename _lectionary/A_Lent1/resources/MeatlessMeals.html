<P>One of our family's Lenten abstinences, is to forego meat on
Wednesdays and Fridays. We don't eat meat on Friday's anyway, but now
I have to come up with twice as many meatless meal ideas.</P>
<P>If any of you who are abstaining on all or some of the days of
Lent, are noticing the same thing I am, then Macaroni and Cheese, and
onion omelettes, are getting really boring already. (Those are my
stock Friday-abstinence meals, since we do meatless Fridays all year
round as the BCP suggests.)</P>
<P><U>Pamela's Macaroni and Cheese:</U></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Combine 2L water and 30ml salt in a large pot and heat on
	High, to bring it to a roiling boil.</P>
	<LI><P>Melt 15ml of butter in a small pot (or use 15ml canola oil).
	Stir in 15ml of flour, making a paste. Add 3ml salt and pepper (and
	paprika or mustard) to taste -- about 1 ml each. Stir in seasonings.
	Gradually stir in 250 ml of milk.</P>
	<LI><P>Grate 150g of cheddar cheese and stir into the sauce. Heat on
	medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce begins to
	simmer.</P>
	<LI><P>With any luck your water should be boiling now. Add 500ml of
	elbow macaroni to the boiling water; cook until tender (about ten
	minutes; might be shorter at sea level), stirring occasionally to
	break up any clumps and keep the macaroni from boiling over. You
	might have to turn the heat down slightly.</P>
	<LI><P>Get out a flat wide casserole dish, about 20cm x 30cm. Slice
	8 slices of cheddar cheese about 8cm square.</P>
	<LI><P>Once the macaroni is tender, drain it and pour it into the
	dish. Pour the sauce evenly over it and stir to distribute the sauce
	evenly. Arrange the cheese slices on top, and brown under a broiler
	element until the cheese browns slightly.</P>
</UL>
<P>Now, that is all very nice, and you are all welcome to try it. It
has the advantage that even 75% of my picky-eater meat-and-potatoes
non-pietist household will eat it (including my dear husband, who
takes a depressingly evangelical view of such things as Lenten
abstinence but is willing to indulge me as long as I don't make him
eat tofu or nutloaf.</P>
<P>But it won't do if you are fasting from dairy and oil, too, and
believe me, it won't do for twice a week for the next six weeks; let
alone for six times a week.</P>
<P>So, if anybody wants to offer some additional suggestions for
meatless dinners, this is the thread for it! 
</P>
<P>When I get a chance, I'll offer up my onion omelette recipe, and
the vegetarian cornish pastries with curried eggs that I served in
desperation last night, and for which the family's picky eaters
actually showed some enthusiasm!</P>
