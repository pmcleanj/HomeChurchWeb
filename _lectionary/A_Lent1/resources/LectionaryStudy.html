date. Lent is our time of preparation for Easter: a time to examine
our souls and consciences; a time to reform our lives; a time to
prepare for the greatest feast of the year, that commemorates the
greatest event of all creation. Over the weeks of Lent, the Gospel
readings will take us with Christ along the road to redemption.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
