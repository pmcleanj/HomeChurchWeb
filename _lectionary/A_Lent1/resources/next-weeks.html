      <h2>Could It Be&#8230;..Satan?</h2>
One of the questions that I have always struggled with is the existence
of Satan.&nbsp; While I was in seminary, I remember struggling with the
question of Evil and Satan during an initial interview with a group of
people who were to help decide if I really was being called into the
ministry of Word and Sacrament.&nbsp; My advisor at the time took me on
and told me I better come to some understanding before my senior year.
Well, I don&#8217;t believe I have all the answers now ten years into the
ministry.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I wonder if Satan language has become somewhat passé?&nbsp; Partly
because of my seminary experience, I now ask all my confirmation
classes to discuss with their parents their understanding of Satan and
evil.&nbsp; The class is usually split on their belief of Satan.&nbsp;
Yet, everyone believes in evil.&nbsp; Out of the conversations with
their parents come the comments of how the church has changed in
addressing Satan and evil.&nbsp; Not that it is a bad thing, but the
church doesn&#8217;t talk about Satan much anymore.&nbsp; Clearly, many of us
continue to struggle with the power of evil compared to the power of
God.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Throughout scripture and in comparable writings of other religions
written at the same time, the question of evil was an important
one.&nbsp; Evil was the cause of everything from illness to
calamity.&nbsp; The Old Testament understanding as found in such books
as Job, sees Satan to be the accuser or one who tests others.&nbsp;
That sense is not lost in our stories for today.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel<br>
      </h4>In this weeks
Gospel, Jesus was &#8220;tempted&#8221; by the devil in the wilderness.&nbsp; The
feel of Matthew&#8217;s Gospel is that the &#8220;devil&#8221; is accusing Jesus.&nbsp;
Eugene Boring in his commentary on Matthew says, &#8220;To the extent that
Jesus&#8217; temptation serves as a model for Christians, it might teach us
that to be a &#8220;child of God&#8221; (a Matthean designation for Christians; see
5:9; cf. 28:10) means to have a trusting relationship to God that does
not ask for miraculous exception to the limitations of an authentic
human life.&#8221;&nbsp; This of course flies in the face of a more
fundamentalist understanding of healing tied to the idea that if we
believe, God will heal.&nbsp; The accusation puts the stress on our
belief rather than the goodness of Christ.&nbsp; It also flies in the
face of our understanding of the third article of the Apostles
creed.&nbsp; Luther grounds us in the belief that it is the Holy Spirit
that works in us faith.<br>
      <br>
The temptations or accusations that come to Jesus have to do with his
messiahship.&nbsp; Here we have a verbal duel between Jesus and the
devil and the devil is quoting scripture.&nbsp; (Let this be a lesson
to all of us; just because someone knows the Bible &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221;
does not mean that person is up to any good.)&nbsp; The tempter comes
and says, &#8220;If you are the Son of God&#8230;turn stones to bread&#8230;prove
yourself&#8230;follow a different way and you will have power.&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus
says that the way of God is different from the way of evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus loyalty was at stake.&nbsp; Jesus could remain faithful to God or
be seduced by the devil&#8217;s interesting suggestions.<br>
      <br>
On this day as Jesus begins his road to the cross he wins his first
victory over the powers of evil, evil that we all face.&nbsp; Somehow
health and wholeness is found in following God and turning away from
that which is evil.&nbsp; This is a continual call for the Christian
and something we can only do with the help of God.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>In our Old Testament lesson we see a man and woman who tried to be
God while in our Gospel lesson we see a man who knew who he was and who
was content to be human.&nbsp; The irony is that those who tried to be
God did not do too well as human beings, while the one who was content
to be human became know as the Son of God.<br>
      <br>
As we hear this story of Adam and Eve we may remember some common
phrases.&nbsp; Comedians are famous for the line, &#8220;the devil made me do
it!&#8221;&nbsp; The Genesis story has sometimes been misused to blame the
woman as the one who caused the man to sin.&nbsp; Of course this
doesn&#8217;t give much credit to the male species.<br>
      <br>
Whatever the case may be, commentators often go back to this story of
Adam and Eve to define the fall of humanity into sin.&nbsp; The serpent
is often looked at as the stumbling block, the evil force.&nbsp; It
should be noted that the serpent is not labeled as evil in our
story.&nbsp; It is an ambivalent, crafty creature.&nbsp; Terry Fretheim
raises the question, &#8220;Inasmuch as God made the serpent, the text raises
the issue of God&#8217;s responsibility for what happens.&nbsp; God holds
ultimate responsibility in the sense that God did not create puppets,
but made human beings in such a way that they could resist the will of
God.&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The serpent does play a role similar to Satan in Job.&nbsp; The serpent
here accuses God of keeping knowledge, of tempting humanity with the
forbidden.&nbsp; Once again when God is ignored illness and suffering
creep in.<br>
<br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>In
our second reading St. Paul celebrates the victory of Jesus over sin,
death and the devil.&nbsp; We are reminded of where Jesus is, healing
happens.&nbsp; Jesus death and resurrection on the cross is pure gift
out of the sheer grace and love of God.&nbsp; While we may never
totally understand what causes evil, pain or sin we can trust that this
is not the will of God.&nbsp; Whether it is the devil, the serpent or
our own disobedience, Jesus came that we might be made righteous.&nbsp;
When healing happens could it be&#8230;..Jesus?<br>
