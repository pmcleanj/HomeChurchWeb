<h4>Out Of Our Present Morass</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Have your been tempted with despair? Have you ever felt hopeless? What did you do about the situation?</i></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>12 Through the action of one man, sin came
into this world. And, through sin, death came into the world. Death
spread like a disease to everyone, as everyone sinned. 13 Sin was in
the world before the Law. But no one was charged with sin since there
was no Law. 14 Death ruled from Adam to Moses. It also ruled over those
who did not sin since the image of Adam&#8217;s sin existed. But, Adam
himself was a image of the One who would come.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>15 The gift of God&#8217;s grace is not like sin. If
many died because of one man&#8217;s sin, how much greater will God&#8217;s grace
and the grace of Jesus Christ be for these people. 16 God&#8217;s gift is not
like the death that was caused by the sinner Adam. Everyone was
condemned to death because of his sin. But, despite many sins, the gift
of grace gives life before God. 17 If death ruled because of one man&#8217;s
sin, how much more will the ones who receive grace and life before God
now rule with one man, Jesus Christ. 18 So, just as everyone was
condemned to death because of one bad act, everyone can receive God&#8217;s
life because of one good act. 19 Through the disobedience of one man,
many were judged as sinners. But, through the obedience of one man,
many will be alive before God.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>12 Because of this, indeed through one man, sin
came into the world and, through sin, death, and so among all men death
spread, as whom all sinned. 13 For until the Law (existed), sin was in
the world but (sin) was not (formally) charged, as there was no Law, 14
but death ruled (as a king) from Adam to Moses and upon the (ones) not
having sinned (based) on the image of the transgression of Adam, who is
an impression (made by a hammered stamp) of the (ONE) about to be.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>15 But, the gift (of grace) is also thus not as
the trespass. For if by the trespass of one many died, (how) much more
does the grace of God and the grace of ONE MAN JESUS CHRIST
(exceedingly) abound for many. 16 The gift (is) not as (that) through
the one having sinned. Indeed, (there was) judgement for condemnation
from one (trespass), but the gift of grace (gave) toward (the
judgement) of righteousness, out of many trespasses. 17 For, if, in the
trespass of the one, death ruled (as a king) through that one, (how)
much more the (ones) receiving the abundance of grace and the
(judgement of) righteousness in life will rule (as kings) through the
ONE, JESUS CHRIST. 18 So, therefore, as (it came) upon all men into
condemnation through one trespass, thus also (it came) upon all men
into the rightness of life through one righteous act. 19 For, indeed,
through the disobedience of one man, the many were appointed as
sinners, so thus through the obedience of the ONE, the many will be
appointed as righteous ones.</b></p>
<p class="indent">5:12 &#8220;as whom all sinned&#8221; can also be translated
&#8220;because all sinned.&#8221; According to Paul, sin is the cause of death. But
the text does not explain the relationship of sin and death with
humanity. Is sin hereditary like death (i.e, &#8220;Original Sin&#8221;)? Or, is
death present because humanity is steeped in sin and cannot escape the
clutches of evil? The phrase &#8220;as whom all sinned&#8221; implies heredity. The
phrase &#8220;because all sinned&#8221; implies the presence of incapacity of
humanity to escape sin. The context favors heredity (as it is
translated above).</p>
<p class="indent">5:13 &#8220;as there was no Law&#8221; is literally &#8220;not being of the Law.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">5:16 &#8220;(the judgement) of righteousness&#8221; The term
&#8220;righteousness&#8221; has been translated &#8220;acquittal&#8221; by some, due to the
legal analogy Paul used. However, the modern meaning of acquittal means
freedom. The ancient meaning had much more nuance; it meant a return to
position before the king and the royal court. Instead of condemnation
as a traitor, a position of right standing was restored, including all
benefits and prerogatives.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We&#8217;re all sinners and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a
way out. Fortunately, God always provides an escape hatch. When we
trust God in the person of Jesus Christ, we find freedom from our lowly
status. We find grace, that free gift of God&#8217;s very life!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Why do we have this freedom? Simply put, God
decided to free us from a self-imposed situation. Humanity (found in
its model Adam) wanted to play God, to control the situation, to
experience the false fruit of evil. But God sent us a new model for
humanity, a person who obeyed the Father. Through his faithfulness, we
see life without evil. When we are one with him, we are free.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was the insight of Paul in his letter to the
Romans. Despite the repetitious, and even torturous language, Paul made
his point clear. Sin was a reality that lead to death, the greatest
evil. Humanity was awash in sin, a reality that spread like a disease.
But this was not God&#8217;s intent. No, he wished life for his creation, a
life with him. So, his gift was his life, a power so great it overcame
evil and death. His gift can be found in his Son, Jesus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul used legal language throughout this passage.
In a royal court, the king would judge a person worthy or unworthy. The
worthy stood before the king, in allegiance with the king. The worthy
enjoyed the benefits from such standing. But the unworthy were
condemned, removed from the presence of the king. Such removal meant a
loss of status and favor. It meant others would ostracize the unworthy
at best. At worst, the unworthy would be exiled (loss of community) or
executed. Such was the power of the king.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As Paul saw the situation, sin enthroned death. The
Grim Reaper was the monarch. He judged all unworthy and sentenced all
to death. But, Paul saw the Risen Lord as the One who unseated death.
In its place, God would reign. All who put their trust in God and his
Son would be acquitted of death&#8217;s sentence. More important, they would
be restored to a place in God&#8217;s royal court. They would enjoy the
privileges and benefits of divine favor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Faith in God gives us a new insight. There is a way
out of our morass. Evil can be defeated, because already has been
defeated. Despite the present outlook, the work of Christ gives us
hope. He has been where we find ourselves now. And he can lead us to
victory!</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How does God give you hope? How does your faith in Christ comfort you in the dark times?</i></p>
