      <h2>What Defiles?</h2>
      <p>As a parent, I have recently reached the stage of needing to figure out what to allow my six-year-old to watch on television.  Yes, the level we are on right now concerns such shows as “Rugrats.”  I suspect as my children grow, the questions will become even more difficult.  Already at age six, my daughter is receiving peer pressure to watch certain shows.  The question that is always difficult to discern is how television is affecting my daughter.  Like all parents I want to protect enough, but not over-protect.
</p>
      <p>There is a lot of discussion on violence in the media and how that effects our youth.  The question is, “What is the long-term impact on our national psyche when millions of children, in their formative years, grow up decade after decade bombarded with very powerful visual and verbal messages demonstrating violence as the preferred way to solve problems and normalizing fear and violence as ‘the way things are.’”  When Deborah Prothrow-Stith, M.D., dean of Harvard University’s School of Public Health, begins one of her eloquent speeches on the growing crisis of violence as a public health issue in society, she often recounts the story of a young gunshot victim being treated in a Boston hospital emergency room.  He expressed surprise that his wound actually hurt.<br />
          <br />
          “I thought, boy, he’s really stupid, anybody knows that if you get shot, it’s going to hurt.  But it dawned on me that what he sees on television is that when the superhero gets shot in the arm, he uses that arm to hold onto a truck going 85 miles an hour around a corner.  He overcomes the driver and shoots a couple of hundred people while he’s at it.”</p>

<p>Some experts now believe that of the 25,000 murders committed in the United States every year (the greatest number of any industrialized country), at least half are due to the influence and desensitizing effects of media violence.  Of course, our First Amendment protections are still important.  But as a parent, I wonder how I can protect and still teach my child.  Ultimately, what is it that defiles?  Is it a certain television show?  Is it a number of shows over a long period of time?  Is it the lack of parental involvement helping a child discern good from bad though the early years of media saturation?</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
      <p>Here we have the question of what makes an ‘insider’ and an ‘outsider.’  The new community is God’s to create and sustain.  That creating is an ongoing task.  Here Israel’s former ideas of who could be “in” and who was “out” was being challenged.  In this passage the Lord asks that justice be maintained and that people do what is right.  “Right doing” is of course always up to discussion as seen by our Gospel lesson.  The truth is that God is always expanding the “insider” list to include more and more people.  <br><br>

In this passage there is a radical statement about the generosity of grace and the universality of God’s love to be found in the entire Bible.  God includes a group commonly considered outside the definition of God’s people.  While we always need to be critical of outside influences, and while we may always be cautious of outsiders, it continues to be true that what is most important is that the love of God is proclaimed in word and deed.</p>

<h4 class="band">Link to the gospel</h4>
<p>Obviously, Jesus is not talking about media defiling the world.  But he does make a statement, “it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.”  There is a concern in the passage for what is holy as opposed to what defiles.  Jesus is talking in Matthew’s Gospel specifically about ritual hand washing matters that separated the Pharisees’ with the Matthean church.  Boring in the New Interpreter’s Bible makes the statement, “Christians of every generation need to see themselves as belonging to a community called to holiness, and to ask what in our own time violates this holiness and nullifies the church’s witness.”  Ultimately, Jesus says, it is not what goes in, but what comes out that defiles.

It is interesting that off of this story of defilement comes the story of the Syrophoenicain Woman.  These two stories set out to challenge what is clean and unclean, who is deserving and undeserving.  I remember when I traveled to India, learning that it is considered “unclean” to offer one’s left hand to another.  Part of this has to do with health issues and cleanliness issues.  In the United States offering one’s left hand is not considered unclean.  Questioning whether the media can defile and who the outsiders are in our society may be modern day equivalents to the questions raised in our Gospel for today.</P>

<h4 class="band">Link to the second lesson</h4>
<p>This passage reminds us all of the grace of God.  While we will continually debate what defiles and what doesn’t defile and struggle with who is in and who is out, Paul reminds us of the promise of God.  “For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all” (Rom. 11:32).  God continues to seek his divine redemption even in the midst of human mismanagement.  Again we see that even our own disobedience cannot separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.  God remains steadfast and faithful to God’s creation.</p>
      
<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p class="box_sml">1. What do you consider Holy in your life?</p>
<p>2. What is it that challenges those Holy things in your life?</p>
<p>3. Who are those that you consider the "outsiders" in our culture today?</p>
<p>4. What do you think God’s word is for the outsiders?</p>
<p>5. How do we deal with those passages of scripture where Jesus seems abrupt (such as Matthew 15:24-26).</p>
<p>6. How do you think violence in the media is affecting our culture and our faith?</p>
