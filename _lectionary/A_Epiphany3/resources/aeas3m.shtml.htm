<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 2:14a,36-41</strong>
<p>Peter now comes to the conclusion of his speech to the Jerusalem
crowd, in which he interprets the event they have just witnessed: the
coming of the Holy Spirit. From Joel, he has shown that the end times,
and therefore salvation, are at hand. He has shown how we have access
to salvation: it is through Jesus, whom God has made &#8220;both Lord and
Messiah&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A36" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">36</a>). It is imperative that those who 
hear may receive new life in Christ.</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s words about the crowd&#8217;s responsibility for Jesus&#8217; death stuns his readers: &#8220;they were cut to the heart&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A37" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">37</a>),
but rather than being turned off, they ask &#8220;what should we do?&#8221;. In
spite of the dark deed of their past, he urges them to undergo a
radical change of heart (&#8220;Repent&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>)
to serving the living God, to be &#8220;baptised ... in the name of Jesus&#8221;.
Then their sins will be forgiven and they will receive the Holy Spirit
(as promised by God through Joel), a promise open to &#8220;everyone&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>) whom God calls and who call upon 
God (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>). &#8220;Save yourselves

(&#8220;about three thousand&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A41" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">41</a>, a round number) respond and are 
baptised; they are &#8220;added&#8221; to the 120 believers

begun; they are saved from the sin of rejecting the Messiah. They <em>devote themselves</em> to learning from the apostles, to &#8220;fellowship&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A42" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">42</a>), participating in the Eucharist,

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 116:1-4,12-19</strong>

my voice&#8221;. Because God helped him in his time of &#8220;distress and anguish&#8221;

People believed that it <em>ensnared</em> those gravely ill.) When he called on God for help (v.

are a lesson for those present; the &#8220;simple&#8221; are those who are direct,
rather than devious, with God.) Even when afflicted, he kept his faith
in God (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+116%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>). He now <em>walks before the

God&#8217;s ways). How can he pay back God for saving him? (v.

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

be ready for Christ&#8217;s second coming. Do not fall back into the pagan
immorality you practised before your conversion to the faith; rather,
separate yourselves from such ways: live ethically.</p>

marginalise you from the pagan world around you (&#8220;exile&#8221;). God paid for your freedom from pagan ways (as one might <em>ransom</em>, v.

<p>Especially at Passover, the lamb sacrificed had to be perfect, as
Jesus was. The incarnation is very valuable (&#8220;precious&#8221;). God planned
redemption through Christ from before his creative act (&#8220;destined&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>); with Christ&#8217;s life, the 
final stage of history has begun (&#8220;end of the ages&#8221;). God raised Jesus to &#8220;glory&#8221; (v.

<small><br>
<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Three gospels in the New Testament offer similar portraits of the life of Jesus; 
Luke is the third of them. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied
Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), 
a collection of sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a 
gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, 
sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke 
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily 
for Gentiles.

<hr>
<strong>Luke 24:13-35</strong>
<p>It is later on Easter Day, the day on which Mary Magdalene and the
other women have discovered the empty tomb. As two of Jesus' followers
walk to Emmaus, they talk about the day's news, the recent startling
events. Eusebius, the first church historian, tells us that &#8220;Cleopas&#8221;
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>) was a relative of Jesus. The two 
do not recognize our Lord. Jesus asks &#8220;What things?&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>).
Their reply shows the limitations of their understanding of who Jesus
is: they do realize that he is a prophet and, like Moses, &#8220;mighty in
deed and word&#8221;, but they have no idea that he is divine. Jesus has
disappointed them: they expected him to deliver Israel from Roman
domination, and to begin an earthly kingdom of God (&#8220;redeem Israel&#8221;, v.
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>).
Three days have passed (long enough, in Jewish belief, for the soul to
have left the body) and, despite Jesus' statement that he would be
raised from death, nothing has happened! The women told us that he is
alive, but when Peter and John went there, all they saw was the empty
tomb! (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus tells them how slow they are to grasp how the Old Testament
prophecies are fulfilled in him. Was it not God's plan (&#8220;necessary&#8221;, v.
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26</a>) that Jesus should be crucified 
and ascend to be with the Father? He interprets his life as a fulfilment of all of Scripture, from &#8220;Moses&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>, the first five books of the 
Bible) to &#8220;all the prophets&#8221;. The meal seems to be a Eucharist: &#8220;he took bread, blessed and broke it&#8221;" (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">30</a>). Then, from Jesus&#8217; 
interpretation and their hospitality to this &#8220;stranger&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>) &#8220;their eyes were 
opened&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>),
i.e. they develop a deeper understanding of who Jesus is, that he is
divine. At the Last Supper, Jesus said he would not share food with his
disciples until God&#8217;s kingdom came. He has now eaten with the two, so
the Kingdom has indeed come. &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed ... !&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+24%3A34" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">34<u>)</u></a><u>.</u></p>
