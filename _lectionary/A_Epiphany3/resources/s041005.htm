Throughout the Gospels we have seen and heard of many astonishing events: healings, 
exorcisms, the raising of Lazarus, the multiplication of loaves and fishes, and 
the sky opening up with the voice of God addressing those present. These many, 
convincing &#8220;revelations&#8221; are powerful, but no more powerful than the simple acts 
and events of this passage from Luke about the Emmaus story. <br>
<br>
Friends are making their way from one place &#8211; a place of hope-turned-into-despair, 
a place of perplexity and the unbelievable (and "idle") tales of women &#8211; to another 
place: Emmaus. Frederick Buechner has written evocatively in The Magnificent Defeat 
of the many ways we seek to find a place, an Emmaus, to run to when we have lost 
hope or don&#8217;t know what to do, the place of escape, of forgetting, of giving up, 
of deadening our senses and our minds and maybe our hearts, too. He even says 
that "Emmaus may be going to church on Sunday."<br>
<br>
As you look from the pulpit at your congregation, do you see folks who have gone 
to Emmaus, even though they appear to be in church? What do you think took, or 
drove, them there? How can the community of faith support the opening of their 
eyes? These resurrection appearances are powerful stories of community, of believers, 
doubters, and strugglers gathering and breaking apart, and gathering again, coming 
together and telling the stories of their experiences, sharing their memories 
of Jesus &#8211; his acts and his words &#8211; and then, as we must today, as people of faith, 
shining the light of Scripture on that experience and coming to new understandings. 
But that&#8217;s not all. They sit at table and break bread, and often, more than intellectual 
understanding, they come to see with their hearts what was right before them. 
<br>
<br>
What are stories from your own life and the life of your congregation, when your 
eyes were opened because someone welcomed you, or you opened your heart, your 
door, your life, to a stranger, someone you didn&#8217;t expect to be a blessing? <br>
<br>
If the world of the disciples had been turned upside down by this person Jesus, 
think of how that same world had been &#8220;rocked&#8221; by his death. Even so, they haven&#8217;t 
had time to absorb that calamity when new stories have sprung up. When has the 
news or your life unfolded in ways that shook the foundations of what you believed 
in, perhaps too fast for you to process and integrate into your understanding? 
What did you do to find peace and balance, and to build new foundations? <br>
<br>
If the Bible is about hospitality, hospitality, hospitality, how might we tell 
this story as one of hospitality and its deepest meaning? Is hospitality a condescending 
or begrudging, dutiful sharing (preferably from our excess, not our substance), 
or is it a kind of openness and a welcoming of change and new learning, perhaps 
even of transformation, brought to us from unexpected places by unlikely people, 
strangers even? If we know that we must see Jesus &#8220;in the least of these,&#8221; how 
can we not share our table and its abundance with all who are hungry, in one way 
or another? In what ways have you known hunger, both physical and spiritual? Who 
was the unexpected person who shared with you, and transformed your life? <br>
<br>
The New Interpreter&#8217;s Bible commentary on Luke draws intriguing parallels between 
this story and that of Lazarus and the rich man, drawn from the work of Eugene 
Wehrli. Both stories involve the interpretation of Scripture (&#8220;Moses and the prophets&#8221;), 
table sharing (or not!) and &#8220;someone rising from the dead.&#8221; Again, hospitality 
has the potential to transform our lives if it opens our eyes even more than we 
have opened our doors. As the United Church of Christ strives to extend and embody 
extravagant hospitality, where is the possibility of transformation within our 
congregations and our selves? How is <i><b>God still speaking</b></i> to your 
congregation in the simple breaking of bread, the sharing of the story, the study 
of Scripture? <br>
<br>
The experience of these two travelers (one may have been a woman, like other New 
Testament pairs) was fleeting, as our glimpses of God, or brushes with God&#8217;s presence, 
are. We look back on our experiences and process them, understanding them better 
&#8220;in the rear view mirror&#8221; than we did face-to-face. How does <i><b>God still speak</b></i> 
to us today, not only through the encounter these early Christians had with Jesus, 
but through our own encounters with him, in the breaking of bread, the sharing 
of our stories, the study of Scripture? Is there more here than only hearing the 
story of others, long ago and far away? What is happening inside us, and how are 
our hearts burning within us? When we struggle with questions of meaning and we 
just can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening around us, is the answer often right before 
us? <br>
<br>
So much in these readings, as in all of Scripture, calls for our response. The 
crowd in the reading from Acts, hearing Peter&#8217;s passionate sermon, asks what they 
should do, and he calls them to repent and be baptized. But he also makes a promise: 
they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This promise is not just for them, 
but for their children (for us today, their descendants in faith), and &#8220;for all 
who are far away, all whom the Lord our God calls to God.&#8221; If we understand these 
words as meaning &#8220;the Gentiles,&#8221; which was unthinkable for many in the early church, 
we may look around and wonder who the &#8220;unthinkable&#8221; ones are, those who are &#8220;far 
away&#8217; but nevertheless called by God. Again, how does the hospitality of a <i><b>still-speaking 
God</b></i> call for a response from us that repents our failure to include and 
welcome and empower even the least likely and the most unexpected, &#8220;all who are 
far away&#8221;? What sort of transformation might that work in our lives and our communities? 
<br>
<br>
The reading from First Peter may be addressed to those who are not only metaphorically 
&#8220;aliens&#8221; but concretely so, those who feel &#8220;not at home&#8221; where they are, perhaps 
stripped of their rights to participate fully in the life of the community and 
to enjoy its protections and benefits. If our response to all of this good news, 
and to the call of a gracious, generous, hospitable, compassionate and <i><b>still-speaking 
God,</b></i> is to &#8220;love one another deeply from the heart,&#8221; how will our lives 
look and feel different than they do now?

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about 
seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things 
that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came 
near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he 
said to them, &#8220;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&#8221; 
They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered 
him, &#8220;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that 
have taken place there in these days?&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">He asked them, &#8220;What things?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, 
who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how 
our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified 
him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all 
this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women 
of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when 
they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed 
seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women 
had said; but they did not see him.&#8221; Then he said to them, &#8220;Oh, how foolish you 
are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was 
it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into 
his glory?&#8221; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to 
them the things about himself in all the scriptures. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as 
if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, because 
it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&#8221; So he went in to stay with 
them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, 
and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and 
he vanished from their sight. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">They said to each other, &#8220;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was 
talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&#8221; That same 
hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their 
companions gathered together. They were saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and 
he has appeared to Simon!&#8221; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how 
he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In 1995, four church women combined $4,000 with a vision of mission to open 
a small transitional residence where they would &#8220;work in faith to end domestic 
violence by being a place of healing and a voice of hope for abused women and 
their children.&#8221; Less than ten years later, Lydia&#8217;s House in St. Louis, Missouri, 
opened its third residential site, a $2.5 million complex which has twenty-five 
living units. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Rev. Mary Albert says the founders took inspiration from the House&#8217;s namesake, 
who is cited in Acts 16. &#8220;Lydia was a woman of faith who experienced a transformation 
of heart and then opened her house to traveling Christians,&#8221; Mary explains. &#8220;The 
identifying marks of our ministry paralleled Lydia in that we, as women of faith, 
sought to provide hospitality and transformation for the women and children we 
would be welcoming.&#8221; Just as important, adds Dawn Stringfield, the executive director, 
&#8220;Lydia is an example of a self-directed woman, capable of making her own choices 
in life&#8211;the potential for each of the women at Lydia&#8217;s House.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Over 200 women and children have been transformed by a program of hospitality 
that includes emotional support and advocacy, as well as practical education in 
parenting, money anagement, and job seeking. Lydia&#8217;s House depends upon referrals 
from a network of emergency shelters, and offers residents up to two years to 
reach the educational, employment, and housing goals that will make possible their 
permanent transition to independent living. During that time, residents are able 
to participate in economic literacy and matched savings programs. Most departing 
residents have the means to make a down payment on a house, rent an apartment, 
further their education, or purchase a reliable a used car. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">None of this would be possible without the host of 350 volunteers from St. 
Louis area churches, synagogues, clubs, and schools. Congregations and civic groups 
agree to furnish and decorate new apartment units as they are built, paint the 
children&#8217;s playrooms, care for the grounds, and volunteer in the after school 
program.

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one 
psalm at each Sunday service, in this order: 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative 
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
