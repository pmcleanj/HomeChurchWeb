<B>Jonah</B>
<P>
Jonah is a prophet, but he is unlike any other for whom a book is named 
in the Old Testament. Some (e.g. Jeremiah) heard the word reluctantly but 
then fully embraced the ministry to which God called them, but Jonah tries 
his best (and his worst!) to avoid doing God's will: he is a caricature of 
a prophet. The book opens with God's call to Jonah: "Go at once to Nineveh 
... and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before me." 
Jonah's reaction is to try to escape God's presence. When called a second 
time, he does travel to the capital of Assyria, and its residents repent of 
their waywardness. A message of this book is that God does care about other 
peoples, even those who are Israel's enemies.

<HR>
<STRONG>Jonah 3:1-5,10</STRONG>
<P>Jonah is the archetypical reluctant prophet. Earlier, in 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Jonah+1%3A2" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">1:2</A>, God has called him to 
&#8220;&#8216;Go at once to Nineveh ... and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before me&#8217;&#8221; but he has tried to escape by sailing to the ends of the earth. God has punished him by having a large fish swallow him.</P>
<P>Now God commands Jonah a second time: God is not going to let him off! He now obeys: he goes to the capital of Assyria, (this being a book of exaggerations) &#8220;an exceedingly large city&#8221; 
(<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Jonah+3%3A3" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">3:3</A>). (Excavations show that it was 
about 5 x 2½ kilometres.) He goes into the city, but only part-way (&#8220;a day&#8217;s walk&#8221;,

for him. The first readers probably identified &#8220;forty&#8221; with either the Flood or the Exodus. Nineveh will be &#8220;overthrown&#8221; or destroyed. In

oracle: they believe God (in the person of his prophet) and acknowledge their godlessness. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Jonah+3%3A6-9" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">3:6-9</A> (not part of our reading) 
tell us the king&#8217;s reaction and edict: he dons &#8220;sackcloth&#8221; and sits in &#8220;ashes&#8221; &#8211; traditional signs of mourning and repentance; he decrees three stages of repentance for all: </P>
<LS>
<LI>admission of guilt, by way of outward signs, </LI>
<LI>change in each person&#8217;s attitude to others (in turning away from evil and violence), </LI>
<LI>acknowledgement of God&#8217;s freedom in how he responds to repentance (&#8220;he <U>may</U> turn from his fierce anger&#8221;,</LI>

accepts their repentance and delivers them.</P>
<P>Obviously this is a story, but it is one that teaches; it is a parable. It illuminates an issue of its time, the waywardness of Israel. God is central and powerful. He can favour whomever he chooses, even hated enemies of the past.</P>

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<STRONG>1 Corinthians 7:29-31</STRONG>
<P>In the Revised English Bible, v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A29" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">29</A> begins: &#8220;What I mean 
... is this: the time we live in will not last long. While it lasts, married men ...&#8221;. V. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A31" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">31b</A> fits naturally: 
&#8220;For the present time is passing away.&#8221; We live in the era between Christ&#8217;s first and second coming. This is the era in which God calls his church to bring as many as possible to believe in him and to follow his ways. This is an 
enormous task, and not one to be taken lightly &#8211; it requires maximum effort from a few. Paul expected the era to end in his own lifetime, so to him every minute of each day counted in a big way: time spent on other activities was time lost.</P>
<P>Paul&#8217;s advice to married men (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A29" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">29b</A>) &#8211; to behave as 
though they have no wives &#8211; must be taken in context, so let us look at the whole chapter. Vv. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A32-33" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">32-33</A> tell us why he wrote 
vv. 29-31a: &#8220;I want you to be free from anxieties ... the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided&#8221;. Paul is saying that, at a very critical time in history, when all 
effort is needed to bring people to the Lord, some need to devote some effort to other matters. We need to examine v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A29" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">29b</A> in the context of this 
letter: </P>
<LS>
<LI>In this chapter, he identifies what are God&#8217;s commands, his commands, and his suggestions; our reading contains suggestions. </LI>
<LI>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A2" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>, Paul recommends 
that (to avoid sexual deviances) &#8220;each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</LI>
</LS>
<P>&#8221; Each has &#8220;conjugal rights&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A3" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>); each has authority over 
the body of the other. Then v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A5" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>: &#8220;Do not deprive one 
another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer ...&#8221; He continues: &#8220;This I say by way of concession, not command. I wish that all were as I myself am [i.e. single]. But each has a particular gift from 
God ...&#8221; (vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A6-7" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">6-7</A>). 
Marriage is important.</P>
<P>So what is Paul saying in vv. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+7%3A29-31" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">29-31</A>? Given the magnitude 
of our mission, we need to devote as much effort as possible to God&#8217;s work. What we do in the world (e.g. commerce, &#8220;deal with the world&#8221;) is of transitory value. Our focus should be on preparation for Christ&#8217;s second 
coming.</P>

<B>Mark</B>
<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<STRONG>Mark 1:14-20</STRONG>
<P>Mark has just told us, briefly, about Jesus&#8217; temptation in the wilderness. Now he returns to Galilee. His message begins with &#8220;the time is fulfilled&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+1%3A15" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>): the time appointed by God, the 
decisive time for God&#8217;s action, has arrived. &#8220;The kingdom of God has come near&#8221;: the final era of history is imminent. Numerous sayings of Jesus support Paul&#8217;s view that the end is near, but Jesus did say that no human knows 
when he will come again, and he will not come when expected 
(<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+13%3A32-36" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">13:32-36</A>). He also said that 
&#8220;the kingdom of God is among you&#8221; (Luke

begun. Jews believed that when they individually and collectively admitted the error of their ways and returned to God&#8217;s way (&#8220;repent&#8221;, v.

are called to adopt God&#8217;s way, to &#8220;believe in the good news&#8221;. The whole of Mark is an expansion of this verse.</P>

disciples are called: they immediately leave their previous occupations, and follow Jesus. Jesus expresses his command in their terms (v.

of this gospel.) These disciples owned nets (v.
