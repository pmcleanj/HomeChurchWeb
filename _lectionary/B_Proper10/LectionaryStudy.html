<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to
the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues,
like as of fire, and it rested upon each of them: and they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues,
as the Spirit gave them utterance. </I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>We have been talking about what it means to &ldquo;be
church&rdquo; -- to carry out the mission of the church to feed the
hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, comfort those in sorrow,
care for widows and orphans. Read <A HREF="http://divinity.lib.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/bpentecost/bProper12.htm#kings"><B>2
Kings 4:42-44 </B></A>What did Elisha do? In what way was Elisha
carrying out the mission of the Church?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Read <A HREF="http://divinity.lib.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/bpentecost/bProper12.htm#psalm145"><B>Psalm
145:10-18 </B></A>What parts of this Psalm do you recognize from
daily prayers? Who is it that &ldquo;fills all things living with
plenteousness? How does this relate to what Elisha did?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Read <A HREF="http://divinity.lib.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/bpentecost/bProper12.htm#john"><B>John
6:1-21</B></A> What are the similarities between this lesson, and the
first lesson? The bible calls this a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;. What is a
miracle? Does a direct action of God have to be spectacular or
supernatural in order to count as a miracle? What miracles are you a
witness to?

Hand-outs</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
