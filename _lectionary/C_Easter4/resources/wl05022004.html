all know people who seem to have naturally strong, distinct
voices&#8212;voices we recognize instantly upon hearing them. Consider the
following lines, and note how each speaker&#8217;s voice has become
inextricably linked with the line itself:<br>
<br>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back!&#8221;  (Arnold Schwarznegger)<br>
&#8220;I have a dream.&#8221;  (Martin Luther King, Jr.)<br>
&#8220;Go ahead, make my day.&#8221;  (Clint Eastwood) <br>
<br>
I&#8217;m sure each of us can come up with several examples of people in our
own lives who have distinct, instantly recognizable voices. These
voices can also run the gamut of responses that they inspire within us
upon our hearing them. Some may grate on our nerves, and cause us to
roll our eyes. Some may inspire us and call us to action. Some may
soothe us and bring us comfort. Some may anger and frustrate us. Some
may bore and exhaust us. As easily as we seem to recognize these
voices, do we really know them?<br>
<br>
I believe such knowing comes about only in the context of
relationships. In our close relationships, the more intimately we get
to know someone, the more adept we become at learning to recognize that
person&#8217;s voice. Our ear becomes attuned to distinguishing the unique
cadences, inflections, and variances in the voices of our closest loved
ones. <br>
<br>
Not only might we become skilled at singling out their voice amidst a
cacophony of others; over time, we also might grow to anticipate the
very words that our loved one might say. Perhaps it is a sort of sixth
sense that helps us to grasp the unique &#8220;lingo&#8221; of our loved one, as we
have moments in which we find ourselves able to finish that person&#8217;s
sentence or share unspoken thoughts almost effortlessly. Not only have
we come to know his or her audible, physical voice, but also the less
tangible, all the more unique, expressions of that voice. </font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#000000"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Link to the Gospel</b></font></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#000000"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This
scene occurs in Jerusalem during the festival of Dedication--what most
of us know, today, as Hanukah. The scene is a tense one, and entrapment
seems to be the agenda at hand. The Jewish leaders encircle Jesus in
the temple and confront him with a public question that is meant to
challenge him. &#8220;How long will you keep us in suspense?&#8221; The Jews are
anxious to clarify Jesus&#8217; identity so they can identify and expel
anyone who represents a threat to their establishment. The words they
use to question Jesus are an idiomatic expression that might also be
translated, &#8220;Why do you provoke us?&#8221; The challenge follows: &#8220;If you are
the Messiah, tell us plainly.&#8221; They are seeking evidence that will help
them to convict Jesus of blasphemy. They are agitated, hostile, and
impatient. <br>
<br>
The Jews may recognize Jesus&#8217; voice, but they do not hear it or &#8220;know&#8221;
it. They want a straightforward answer, directly from the mouth of
Jesus. The irony is that, all along, the very words and actions of
Jesus have served to testify to his Messiahship. The plain and simple
truth is already before them; but, because they are not his sheep, they
have not heard his voice. &#8220;The Father and I are one,&#8221; Jesus concludes.
This oneness describes a close, interpersonal relationship--an intimate
relationship that results in Jesus&#8217; words and actions proclaiming the
very message and will of God. Later in this gospel, in an extended
prayer, Jesus invites his disciples into this same equation of oneness
and solidarity (17:20-21). Just as Jesus and the Father are one, so
does Jesus wish for his followers to be united as one community
gathered around a shared promise. In turn we are called to proclaim the
voice of the Messiah to the rest of the world in order to invite them
in to that community. </font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#000000"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Link to the First Reading</b></font></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#000000"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In
this text we find more clues to understanding the significance of
relationships in the kingdom of God. First, it is important to note
that this is the only time the feminine form for &#8220;disciple&#8221; is used in
the New Testament. Also, the wording makes it clear that Tabitha is not
the only female disciple. This text provides a small bit of evidence to
the fact that women also played a significant role in the early
Christian community--ministry and missionary work was not solely
reserved for men. <br>
<br>
Miracles serve as a powerful tool for proclamation. Here in this text
we see that Tabitha was a significant member of her community, both
socially and in her service of mission. She was devoted to good works
and acts of charity. Her death was likely to have direct ramifications
on the community of widows gathered around her whom she helped to
support. <br>
<br>
It is not Peter who heals Tabitha in this story. Tabitha&#8217;s healing is
carried out by the Lord through the power of relationships: Peter&#8217;s
relationship to God in prayer; Peter&#8217;s relationship to the disciple,
Tabitha; Tabitha&#8217;s relationship to her community. In this story the
miracle is not the fact that Tabitha is brought back to life. The
miracle occurs when &#8220;This became known throughout Joppa, and many
believed in the Lord.&#8221; The Christian community continues to expand
through the proclamation of God&#8217;s promises. A miracle points to
something greater than itself, and it is the proclamation of that
miracle that has a missionary effect. In our relationships we are
invited to point to something greater than ourselves, to proclaim the
promise of that voice that we have grown familiar with in our own
lives.

<p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#000000"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In
this apocalyptic text, the vision of community expands to its broadest
to encompass, &#8220;a multitude ... from every nation, from all tribe and
peoples and languages.&#8221; The scene is a victorious one--crowds robed in
white with palm branches--but none have arrived at the scene without
having first gone through the great ordeal. The community gathered is
diverse and non-segregated. All are cloaked in the same white robe. The
text emphasizes God&#8217;s sustaining promise to support the mission of
their faithful witness. There will be suffering, pain, and sacrifice
along the journey, but ultimately an idyllic scene reminiscent of Psalm
23 awaits those who persevere. Those who continue to listen to and
follow the voice of their shepherding Lord and identify with his
message and witness will be lead through suffering and death to the
waters of eternal life.
