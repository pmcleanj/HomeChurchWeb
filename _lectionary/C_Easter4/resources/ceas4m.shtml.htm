<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 9:36-43</strong>
<p>Peter is visiting people who are already Christians (near modern Tel
Aviv). In Lydda, he has healed a paralysed man (Aeneas); he has said to
him &#8220;Jesus Christ heals you&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A34">34</a>). Now he visits Joppa. 
&#8220;Tabitha&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A36">36</a>, an 
Aramaic name) and &#8220;Dorcas&#8221; both mean <em>gazelle</em>. Luke often emphasizes helping the poor (&#8220;acts of charity&#8221;, v.

recalls the story of Elijah reviving the widow&#8217;s son; Peter&#8217;s action
here is in continuity with the Old Testament and with Jesus&#8217; acts of
healing, especially of Jairus&#8217; daughter (Luke <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+8%3A40-42">8:40-42</a>,

&#8220;disciples&#8221; (vv. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A38">38</a>,

generally devoted their time to good works. As was the custom, people
wept openly when someone died. The widows remember Tabitha&#8217;s help to
many, in sewing inner garments (&#8220;tunics&#8221;) and cloaks for them. As did
Jesus, Peter gets <em>peace and quiet</em> (here, 
by sending the mourners outside, v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A40">40</a>.)
With the help of the Holy Spirit, Peter commands Tabitha to rise, be
resurrected, be brought back to life. In Aramaic, his command to her
sounds like Jesus&#8217; words to Jairus&#8217; daughter: <em>talitha koum[i]</em>. Peter shows members of the Christian community 
(&#8220;saints and widows&#8221;, v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A41">41</a>) that Tabitha is alive again; 
God&#8217;s action through him leads many to faith (v.

&#8220;Simon&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A43">43</a>)
is a Christian. He is a &#8220;tanner&#8221;, a person Jewish law considered
defiled, for he worked with animal carcasses, which were ritually
unclean. Peter has begun to disregard Jewish practices.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>Revelation</b>
</small><p>
<small>This is the last book of the Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of 
the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future and 
presents an understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle between good 
and evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic language, 
its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of persecution. It is 
hard to understand because we do not know the meaning of the symbols (e.g. 
animals) it uses.

<strong>Revelation 7:9-17</strong>
<p>What will happen at the end of time? Will our persecutors be brought
to justice? Will God really give us victory over death? These were
important questions to early Christians. John is in the midst of a
vision of God&#8217;s throne and the heavenly scene around it. He describes
the scene using symbols, only some of which have meanings known to us.
Around God&#8217;s throne are &#8220;twenty-four elders&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A4">4:4</a>, perhaps patriarchs and

representing creation). These are symbols from the Old Testament. A

sealed with seven seals (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+5%3A4-9">5:4-9</a>), containing

<li>a vision of the souls of those martyred for the faith, who ask: <em>Lord, how long will it be before you judge, and render justice, on those who killed us?</em>

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
