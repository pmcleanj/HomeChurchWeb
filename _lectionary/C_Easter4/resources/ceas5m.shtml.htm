<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 11:1-18</strong>
<p>Peter has been in the coastal area northwest of Jerusalem, an area
where there are already believers of Jewish origin. Up the coast, in
Caesarea Philippi, Cornelius (an officer in the Roman army, a Gentile)
has seen a vision in which a messenger from God has told him to send
for Peter. As Peter has approached the town, he too has seen a vision:
of &#8220;the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down,
being lowered&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A11">10:11</a>). In the sheet are &#8220;all 
kinds&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A12">10:12</a>) of animals. A 
voice has said: &#8220;Get up, Peter; kill and eat&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A13">10:13</a>), meaning <em>eat of animals 
forbidden by Jewish law</em>.
At Cornelius&#8217; house, he has told the assembled company (both Jews and
Gentiles): &#8220;You ... know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate
with or to visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call
anyone ... [ritually] unclean&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A28">10:28</a>). He has summed up the good 
news, telling them that &#8220;God shows no partiality&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A34">10:34</a>). The Holy Spirit has come on 
<em>all who hear the word</em>

Gentiles, have been baptized.</p>
<p>Word of this event has reached Judea, where there are believers of Jewish origin (&#8220;circumcised believers&#8221;, v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+11%3A2">2</a>), who ask why he has broken Jewish 
law by visiting and eating with Gentiles. In vv.

chronologically but from the viewpoint of God&#8217;s plan of salvation. (The word translated &#8220;brothers&#8221;, v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+11%3A12">12</a>, denotes close kinship, in the

them&#8221;, Cornelius&#8217; household. In a post-resurrection appearance, Jesus predicted Pentecost (v.

gave them the &#8220;same gift&#8221; (v.

when they believed as he gave us when we came to faith. Peter&#8217;s critics
accept this explanation; God is working in a new way; even Gentiles who
turn to God will receive eternal &#8220;life&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+11%3A18">18</a>).</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>Revelation</b>
</small><p>
<small>This is the last book of the Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of 
the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future and 
presents an understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle between good 
and evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic language, 
its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of persecution. It is 
hard to understand because we do not know the meaning of the symbols (e.g. 
animals) it uses.

made known through John. It is prophecy which reveals secrets of heaven
and earth. Our reading is from John&#8217;s record of his vision of the
end-times. He has told of the destruction of the old city, Babylon
(code name for Rome) and of the old heaven and earth (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+20%3A11">20:11</a>); the ungodly have been

will be renewed, freed from imperfections and transformed by the glory of God.</p>

probably not made with bricks and mortar, &#8220;holy&#8221;, of divine origin,
beautiful and lovely as a &#8220;bride&#8221;. (Marriage is a symbol of the
intimate union between the exalted Christ and the godly remnant. Some
see the city as the church, set apart for God&#8217;s use in the world.) John

<b>John</b>

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

his master.
