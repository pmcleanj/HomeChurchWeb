book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with
Jesus' ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the
church. By no means a comprehensive history, it does however describe
the spread of the church from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as
far as Greece. The episodes he reports show how Christianity arose
out of Judaism. He shows us something of the struggles the church
underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy Spirit guides
and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the Roman

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
this text we find more clues to understanding the significance of
relationships in the kingdom of God. First, it is important to note
that this is the only time the feminine form for &ldquo;disciple&rdquo;
is used in the New Testament. Also, the wording makes it clear that
Tabitha is not the only female disciple. This text provides a small
bit of evidence to the fact that women also played a significant role
in the early Christian community--ministry and missionary work was
not solely reserved for men. <BR><BR>Miracles serve as a powerful
tool for proclamation. Here in this text we see that Tabitha was a
significant member of her community, both socially and in her service
of mission. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. Her
death was likely to have direct ramifications on the community of
widows gathered around her whom she helped to support. <BR><BR>It is
not Peter who heals Tabitha in this story. Tabitha&rsquo;s healing is
carried out by the Lord through the power of relationships: Peter&rsquo;s
relationship to God in prayer; Peter&rsquo;s relationship to the
disciple, Tabitha; Tabitha&rsquo;s relationship to her community. In
this story the miracle is not the fact that Tabitha is brought back
to life. The miracle occurs when &ldquo;This became known throughout
Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.&rdquo; The Christian community
continues to expand through the proclamation of God&rsquo;s promises.
A miracle points to something greater than itself, and it is the
proclamation of that miracle that has a missionary effect. In our
relationships we are invited to point to something greater than
ourselves, to proclaim the promise of that voice that we have grown
familiar with in our own lives.</FONT> </FONT></FONT>

Friends</FONT></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Who is a lasting friend? The
one with whom you share interests, or the one who needs what you have
to offer? In this Sunday's first reading, St. Paul shows us that
generosity is better than shared interests in bonding people
together.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In the past chapters of Acts,
the focus has shifted away from life in the Jerusalem community
towards a missionary effort in the Judean countryside and beyond.
Paul has joined that missionary effort; this passage records a
proclamation from his first missionary journey.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Paul's first speech to the
synagogue is missing from the passage. In 13:15-42, Paul recounts a
short history of Israel to introduce the life, death, and
resurrection of Jesus. The speech had such an effect that Paul was
invited to address the city the next week [44].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The synagogue was split over
the message. Some native Jews and converts were attracted to the Good
News [43], while others opposed Paul to the point of verbal abuse
[45]. Paul's message was clearly controversial and caused great
scandal in the Jewish community. As a result, Paul and Barnabas were
rejected, so, they announced their intention to address the non-Jews;
Paul and Barnabas saw this proclamation as a means to fulfill
prophecy (i.e., Isaiah 49:6) [46-47].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The reaction to Paul's
announcement caused immediate retaliation, with good reason. Paul's
ministry to the Gentiles 1) would mean a schism in the synagogue
between those who believed in Christ and those who did not, 2) would
encourage the free flow of Gentile converts into the community who
would not follow Jewish Law, 3) would create a separate and competing
synagogue if the Christians and the Gentile converts were ejected
from the synagogue. Indeed, that was the eventual result. Paul
established separate Christian synagogues (assemblies) in the cities
where he preached. In the mean time, his message created a strange
opposition, a coalition of rich Jewish women and pagan city fathers
who had Paul and Barnabas thrown out of the city [50].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Paul should have befriended
his fellow Jews with whom he had a shared interest, but he gave a
message to the non-Jews who found joy in faith [48-49,52]. That's
where Paul found his true friends. What is the basis of our
friendships, shared interests (what you can share with me) or sharing
Good News (what I can share with you)? Is friendship found in
selfishness or evangelization?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">These verses represent the
gathering of all the faithful at the end times, in praise of God and
the Lamb. The uncountable throng in 7:9 was the same as the infamous
&ldquo;144, 000&quot; described in 7:4-8 (that is, 12,000 faithful
times the 12 tribes of Israel; since the number &ldquo;12&quot;
represented fulness and completion, the 144,000 represented the
fullness of the faithful remnant). But, in this context, the faithful
remnant of Israel not only comes from the Diaspora, the spread of
God&rsquo;s chosen throughout the world. No, the faithful come from
every land, every people, every race, speaking every tongue. They
would gather together at the end for one purpose: to give praise the
Lord.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The environment was the royal
throne room of heaven. John painted the ceremony as a revelation of
royal glory (influenced by the court proceedings of the Roman Caesar;
the shouts of praise reflected the titles for the Caesars). Yet, John
the Elder alluded to the Feast of Booths, a harvest festival where
pilgrims gathered in Jerusalem and camped around its Temple, so they
could be close to the divine presence. The palms reinforced this
later image, since the Feast included processions with palms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The clothing and the context
of the dialogue after the shout of praise revealed a tension between
the liturgical and end times elements. The elder stated two qualities
of the faithful around the throne. First, they entered the throne
room after they endured the sufferings of the end times (the &ldquo;great
tribulation&rdquo;) and washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb
(an allusion to Baptism and Eucharist). These would be the same
faithful who the Lord would shepherd and lead to &ldquo;living
waters&rdquo; (an allusion to Baptism; see John 4:10). In other
words, John the Elder saw a clear connection between the persecution
of community and its liturgical worship. To join the Christian
community meant suffering; suffering for the faith was a prerequisite
for worship before the throne of God.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Second, the community of the
faithful was protected by God at the end time. There would be no more
hunger or thirst (see the connection of the end times blessing with
the Eucharist in John 6:35). And they would see God&rsquo;s justice.
The destruction of the evil in the world (symbolized by the heat of
the sun) would not touch them. The Lord himself would comfort them
(God would wipe every tear away).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This scene leaves us with one
overarching theme. When we worship God, we should bring our
sufferings to him. Being Christian may not bring us popularity; it
may bring us pain. But Christ did not promise relief from pain. In
fact, he promised us a share in his pain. But a share in his pain
will bring a share in his glory. This is the meaning of the
Eucharist. Share in suffering. Share in glory.</FONT></P>

with the Lord? In prayer? In life? How does he share his glory with
you?</I></FONT></P>

Us</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><I>Have you experienced a
common bond with others? What was that bond? How did it bind you
together?</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Sometimes experience bonds
people together in unexpected ways. A tragedy or a spectacle or,
even, a leader can bring diverse peoples together to share a common
memory or goal. The intimacy the bond brings can only be understood
by those it directly affects. It seems the bond can only be
communicated vicariously to an outsider through analogy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In John's gospel, Jesus
described the bond that unites his followers as the relationship
between a shepherd and his sheep. The analogy of the Good Shepherd
worked, but had its limits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What unites us as Christians?
Culture, habit, fellowship, or something deeper? In John's gospel,
Jesus gave us the answer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">10:28 &quot;eternal life . . .
into the age&quot; These two phrases were equivalent. Eternal life
did not only refer to unending life. It referred to life with God.
(Since God lives in the eternal moment, life with him is unending.) </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Into the age&quot;
referred to God's era, a time of the Kingdom. Notice the results of
life with God included salvation from the tribulation of the end time
(not destroyed into the age) and assurance of life with the Lord (no
one will take the saved from his hand).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">10:29 &quot;My Father who has
given to me all (followers) is greater (than everything).&quot; This
is a very difficult sentence to translate because of the word &quot;all.&quot;
What did the word refer to? There were two possibilities: 1) what the
Father gave Jesus (i.e., his followers) or 2) the power of the Father
(he is greater than &quot;all,&quot; i.e., everything). The
translation above tries to honor both meanings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In the Good Shepherd discourse
(10:1-42), Jesus described his purpose before a skeptical audience.
He acts like a dedicated shepherd. He protects his flock against
thieves and wolves even to the point of death. He befriends his
followers, as a shepherd who treats each sheep like we treat our
favorite family pet. He loves each and every one of us, his
followers, intimately [27].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">As his sheep, we follow his
call [27]. Sheep are not the slow animals some claim; they can do
tricks and they know the particular call of their shepherd. In many
countries, shepherds will mix their herds in holding pens; when a
shepherd calls, only his or her sheep will respond.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Our relationship is more than
call and response, however. Jesus gives us a life that cannot be
taken away [28]. With this life we are in the hands of Jesus and the
hands of the Father [28-29].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Father gave Jesus his
followers as a gift [29]; Jesus gives us, his followers, eternal life
as a gift. Both are the presence of the Spirit. The Spirit of the
Father flows though the Son to us; this outpouring unities us to
Christ and to the Father.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Our relationship with Jesus
begins with his call and our response. The dialogue between Christ
and us deepens the relationship. Through the relationship, the Father
becomes accessible, even intimate. In this relationship we find a
life that can never die; this life is intrinsic to the dialogue. The
entire package (dialogue, relationship, life in the relationship, and
intimacy with the Father) is the result of the Spirit. As the Spirit
unites the believer to Christ, so to it unites Christians to one
another.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Catechism Theme: Four Marks of
the Church (CCC 866-869)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In the gospel, Jesus stressed
the unity he has with his Father and with his followers. This unity
manifests itself in the four marks of the Church, those qualities
that define the Church. The four marks are: one, holy, catholic, and
apostolic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How is the Church &quot;one?&quot;
The Church is one because it has one Lord, it has only one faith, it
is formed in one Baptism, it comes together as one Body, it is given
life by one and the same Spirit, and it shares one hope for the
future. (866)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How is the Church &quot;holy?&quot;
The Church is holy because God the Father called people together to
form the Church, God the Son gave his life up for the Church and is
one with the Church in the sacraments, and God the Holy Spirit gives
the Church life. The Church is a home for sinners who wish to come
closer to God. (867)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How is the Church &quot;catholic?&quot;
The word &quot;catholic&quot; means &quot;for everyone at all times.&quot;
The Church is catholic because it serves everyone and at all times.
The Church has the complete faith. And the Church is the true way to
heaven. (868)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How is the Church &quot;apostolic?
The faith and power come from Christ, the Pope in union with the
bishops and the Church has the power to teach faith and morals
infallibly (i.e., without error). (869)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><I>Have you ever reflected on
the bond that unities you with other Christians? Which of the four
marks are involved in that bond?</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">God is the cause of our
community. He sent his Son into the world to call us, to embrace us,
to unite us. He makes us one with his Son. He sanctifies us with his
Spirit. He gifts us with a full faith and the power to reach out to
others, no matter who they are. He sends us out the same way he sent
out the apostles, to spend the Good News to others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
all know people who seem to have naturally strong, distinct
voices&mdash;voices we recognize instantly upon hearing them.
Consider the following lines, and note how each speaker&rsquo;s voice
has become inextricably linked with the line itself:<BR><BR>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be back!&rdquo; (Arnold Schwarznegger)<BR>&ldquo;I have a dream.&rdquo;
(Martin Luther King, Jr.)<BR>&ldquo;Go ahead, make my day.&rdquo;
(Clint Eastwood) <BR><BR>I&rsquo;m sure each of us can come up with
several examples of people in our own lives who have distinct,
instantly recognizable voices. These voices can also run the gamut of
responses that they inspire within us upon our hearing them. Some may
grate on our nerves, and cause us to roll our eyes. Some may inspire
us and call us to action. Some may soothe us and bring us comfort.
Some may anger and frustrate us. Some may bore and exhaust us. As
easily as we seem to recognize these voices, do we really know
them?<BR><BR>I believe such knowing comes about only in the context
of relationships. In our close relationships, the more intimately we
get to know someone, the more adept we become at learning to
recognize that person&rsquo;s voice. Our ear becomes attuned to
distinguishing the unique cadences, inflections, and variances in the
voices of our closest loved ones. <BR><BR>Not only might we become
skilled at singling out their voice amidst a cacophony of others;
over time, we also might grow to anticipate the very words that our
loved one might say. Perhaps it is a sort of sixth sense that helps
us to grasp the unique &ldquo;lingo&rdquo; of our loved one, as we
have moments in which we find ourselves able to finish that person&rsquo;s
sentence or share unspoken thoughts almost effortlessly. Not only
have we come to know his or her audible, physical voice, but also the
less tangible, all the more unique, expressions of that voice. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
scene occurs in Jerusalem during the festival of Dedication--what
most of us know, today, as Hanukah. The scene is a tense one, and
entrapment seems to be the agenda at hand. The Jewish leaders
encircle Jesus in the temple and confront him with a public question
that is meant to challenge him. &ldquo;How long will you keep us in
suspense?&rdquo; The Jews are anxious to clarify Jesus&rsquo;
identity so they can identify and expel anyone who represents a
threat to their establishment. The words they use to question Jesus
are an idiomatic expression that might also be translated, &ldquo;Why
do you provoke us?&rdquo; The challenge follows: &ldquo;If you are
the Messiah, tell us plainly.&rdquo; They are seeking evidence that
will help them to convict Jesus of blasphemy. They are agitated,
hostile, and impatient. <BR><BR>The Jews may recognize Jesus&rsquo;
voice, but they do not hear it or &ldquo;know&rdquo; it. They want a
straightforward answer, directly from the mouth of Jesus. The irony
is that, all along, the very words and actions of Jesus have served
to testify to his Messiahship. The plain and simple truth is already
before them; but, because they are not his sheep, they have not heard
his voice. &ldquo;The Father and I are one,&rdquo; Jesus concludes.
This oneness describes a close, interpersonal relationship--an
intimate relationship that results in Jesus&rsquo; words and actions
proclaiming the very message and will of God. Later in this gospel,
in an extended prayer, Jesus invites his disciples into this same
equation of oneness and solidarity (17:20-21). Just as Jesus and the
Father are one, so does Jesus wish for his followers to be united as
one community gathered around a shared promise. In turn we are called
to proclaim the voice of the Messiah to the rest of the world in
order to invite them in to that community. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
