<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Exodus is the
second book of the Old Testament, and is part of the Pentateuch, the
first five books of the Bible. Jews refer to these books as &quot;The

the rescue of God's chosen people from captivity in Egypt and the

<P>While Moses was on Mount Sinai the first time, the people of
Israel, under Aaron&rsquo;s leadership, made a golden image of a calf
as a symbol of God. So irate was Moses when he discovered the revelry
around the Calf that he smashed the stone tablets on which the Ten
Commandments were written (32:19). God was angry that the people had
broken the commandment against casting idols of the deity, but in
time has forgiven them; he has invited Moses to ascend the mountain
again to receive a replacement set of tablets. While there, he has
conversed with God. Vv. 10-26 are the &ldquo;covenant&rdquo;

<H4>Embarrass the King</H4>
<P>This passage represents the second time David was able to catch
King Saul off guard. The first time, David was able to approach the
sleeping Saul by accident; David took hem of Saul's tunic, only to
repent of his action.</P>
<P>This time, Saul pursued David [2]. Even though Saul surrounded
himself with guards, David calculated his approach. Remembering God's
will in the person of Saul, David resisted the temptation to kill his
enemy [7-8]. Instead, David took the symbols of Saul's survival
(water jug) and military power (spear) [12-13].</P>
<P>From an opposite high point, David taunts Saul; he challenged the
King to send one of his servants to retrieve the items. This is a
rhetorical remark, for David had the high ground to fend off an
attack. The real purpose of the taunt was revealed; David could have
killed the king but spared Saul's life at cost of his royal honor.
David was the better warrior and power of this story would galvanize
popular support for David. Saul was in decline. From this point on,
David did not try to reconcile with Saul. In David's mind, the
inevitable was in God's hands. [22-23]</P>
<P>No one escapes the wrath of an enemy. But, how do we, as
Christians, respond to direct attack or slander? Do we return in
kind, or do we trust God with the outcome? This is the true measure
of our moral character.</P>
<P><I>How do you trust God with bickering? With gossip? How has God
helped you in these times of temptation and trial?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<P>This is a hymn of praise to God as king. The endings of Vv. 3, 5
and 9 are perhaps a refrain, said or sung by worshippers as they
&ldquo;extol&rdquo; (v. 9) God. God, on his throne above the
&ldquo;cherubim&rdquo; (v. 1, the half-human, half-animal creatures
thought to hover above the altar) in the Temple, is to be praised by
&ldquo;all the peoples&rdquo; (v. 2). V. 4 lists some qualities God
has shown &ldquo;Jacob&rdquo;, the people of Israel. His &ldquo;footstool&rdquo;,
v. 5, is the Ark. For Israel, God has also:

<P><FONT SIZE=2>This is a letter, written in the style common in the
first century AD. From the text, we know that Paul wrote it in
Macedonia after leaving Ephesus, probably in the autumn of 57 AD. It
gives us a picture of Paul the person: an affectionate man, hurt to
the quick by misunderstandings and evil-doing of his beloved fellow
Christians, yet happy when he can praise them. The letter's prime
intent is to combat evils which have arisen in the Christian
communities in the Achaian peninsula of Greece. </FONT>
</P>
<P>Paul contrasts his ministry with that of Moses. In 3:3, he says
that his readers, supported and enabled by the Holy Spirit, are &ldquo;a
letter of Christ&rdquo;, prepared by him and his colleagues: a letter
written on &ldquo;tablets of human hearts&rdquo;, not on &ldquo;tablets
of stone&rdquo;. This is the &ldquo;confidence that we have through
Christ&rdquo; (3:4). The dead letter of the Law has been replaced by
the living letter of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Moses wore a veil lest the radiance of God&rsquo;s glory, shown in
his face, be too much for his hearers. The <EM>new covenant</EM> in
Christ <EM>sets aside</EM> the old. The thinking of Israelites was
frozen in time (&ldquo;hardened&rdquo;, 3:14), and it still is: when
they hear the Law read (&ldquo;old covenant&rdquo;, 3:14; &ldquo;Moses&rdquo;,
3:15), they only see God&rsquo;s plan for saving people dimly, i.e.
through a &ldquo;veil&rdquo;, but when one is converted (&ldquo;turns
to the Lord&rdquo;, 3:16), one sees the plan clearly. In Judaism and
Christianity, the <EM>motive force</EM> is the spirit, but for us
Christ and the Holy Spirit are one (&ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit&rdquo;,
3:17), and in Christ we have &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; from the Law: as
we become more and more Christ-like, we are more and more able to
render to God the honour (&ldquo;glory&rdquo;, 3:18) he is due, with
the Spirit&rsquo;s help. In 10:9-11, Paul&rsquo;s accusers claim that
he is strong on words but weak on action. He now retorts: &ldquo;by
God&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; (4:1) he has turned from persecuting
Christians to &ldquo;this ministry&rdquo; which he does with &ldquo;great
boldness&rdquo; (3:12), not losing heart. Unlike his accusers, he has
cast aside his horrible hidden deeds of the past, namely unscrupulous
acts and misrepresentations of the gospel (4:2). He speaks openly,
appealing to all to authentically discern the truth.</P>

<H4>The Man From Heaven</H4>
<P>15:45 &ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living being&rdquo; was
a combination of Genesis 1:27a (So God created <B>man</B> in his own
image, in the image of God he created him) and 2:7c (man <B>became a
living being</B>). The word &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; had the generic
meaning of &ldquo;man,&rdquo; the addition of &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; to
&ldquo;man&rdquo; was actually redundant.</P>
<P>The phrase &ldquo;become a living being&rdquo; was actually
&ldquo;become into a living (human) soul.&rdquo; In other words, the
verb &ldquo;become&rdquo; had a passive voice, that begged the
question, &ldquo;Who caused this &ldquo;becoming?&rsquo;&rdquo; Of
course, the answer was God. In other words, &ldquo;man&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Adam&rdquo;) received life from God.</P>
<P>Paul balanced the first Adam with the second, the one who would
give life. That phrase was literally &ldquo;the last Adam into a
life-giving spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The first Adam received natural life from God&rsquo;s Spirit; the
last would gift eternal life through that same Spirit.</P>
<P>15:46 &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; was literally the &ldquo;soul-like.&rdquo;
Paul used the language of the human spirit (&ldquo;soul&rdquo;) to
differentiate between the human and the divine (&ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;).</P>
<P>15:48 This sentence was a comparison between the &ldquo;earthly&rdquo;
Adam and the &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; Adam. The sons of the earthy Adam
shared the same curses as the first one (&ldquo;As such, the dust
(one), so too, (those) dust (ones)&rdquo;). Those who believe in the
heavenly Adam (Christ) would share in the same blessings he does
(&ldquo;and as such (one) of heaven, so too, (those) of heaven&rdquo;).</P>
<P>Paul ended the body of his letter to the Corinthian Church with
arguments for the resurrection of the body. In 15:35-37, he created a
&ldquo;straw man&rsquo;s&rdquo; argument to combat. This fictitious
opponent questioned the kind of body the raised would have. Paul
replied with an agricultural analogy (difference between seeds and
plants) and the different types of bodies (animals and people). He
stressed the resurrection will basically change the body. The exact
nature of the change and details of the end result were a matter of
mystery. But he did say that the raised body would be &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;
in nature.</P>
<P>What is the difference between the &ldquo;earthly&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; body? Paul did not explain physiological
differences (which would be speculative, at best). But he did explain
the difference in terms of the two human archetypes: Adam and the
Risen Christ. Adam disobeyed God. So, he left a legacy of sin,
sickness and death (from dust to dust). He represented estrangement
from God. But the Risen Lord (the &ldquo;second&rdquo; Adam) lived
perfect obedience. He was the sign of freedom from this evil. He
personified life with God.</P>
<P>Our life with God now is a foretaste to eternity. While we
struggle in our earthly form, we will be blessed with a heavenly
form. Every part we possess, body and soul, mind and heart, will
enjoy eternal life. Now, we wait with praise and gratitude for
resurrection of the body.</P>
<P><I>How does belief in the resurrection of the body change your
outlook on life? How do you hope to live like Christ?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P>Jesus has predicted his suffering, death and resurrection to his
disciples; he has called on them to &ldquo;take up their cross&rdquo;
(v. 23), has warned that those who hear the gospel but fail to trust
in it will be condemned, and has promised that some present will see
the kingdom of God. Now he and the inner circle of disciples ascend
&ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; (v. 28). In Luke, Jesus always prays
before an important event.</P>
<P>An aura of unnatural brightness is linked with mystical
appearances in Exodus and Acts; &ldquo;dazzling white&rdquo; (v. 29)
is a symbol of transcendence. In Jewish tradition, both &ldquo;Moses
and Elijah&rdquo; (v. 30) were taken into heaven without dying.
Jesus&rsquo; agenda is in accord with the Law and the prophets; he is
doing God&rsquo;s will. &ldquo;Two men&rdquo; also appear at the
resurrection and at the ascension. Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;departure&rdquo;
(v. 31, <EM>exodos</EM> in Greek) is his journey to Jerusalem and his
passage from this world. Peter clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand;
perhaps he thinks he is witnessing a <U>super</U> Feast of
Tabernacles (&ldquo;dwellings&rdquo;, v. 33) &ndash; a time when the
whole city was brightly illuminated. The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; (v. 34)
is a symbol of God&rsquo;s presence; the words from it recall Jesus&rsquo;
baptism, and add &ldquo;listen to him!&rdquo; (v. 35). Vv. 37-43a,
the healing of an epileptic child, present three contrasts:

	<LI><P>Jesus&rsquo; fidelity to God vs. general human infidelity. 
	</P>

<P>The child is in miserable condition. In healing him, Jesus shows
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; to &ldquo;all&rdquo; (v. 43).</P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>A Simple Rule</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>Have you ever seen the Golden Rule applied? How did
it change the situation? The people involved?</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>What would happen if the Golden Rule were always
applied? In our culture obsessed with rights denied and litigation,
this guide to life seems to attract little more than lip service. But
the idea behind it is universal. Treat others the way you would like
to be treated. This thought has been found in almost all the world
religions in one form or another. The import of the rule remains
universal simply because it can be so radical, so life-changing. What
would happen if the Golden Rule were always applied? Everything!</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Jesus presented the Golden Rule, but gave it two
interesting twists. Use the rule as an invitation to everyone
(including enemies) to become followers of Jesus. And rephrase the
rule. Pretend the Other is God himself.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Last week, Jesus divided the poor from the rich in
Luke's version of the Beatitudes. This week, Jesus taught how the
poor (Christians) should respond to their enemies, what makes them
different from others, and reward they will receive for their
efforts. All three of these areas were implicit in the Golden Rule.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:27-28 In last week's study, Jesus condemned the
&quot;rich&quot; as he compared them to the &quot;poor.&quot; In the
context of 6:22-23, the rich could be identified as Jews from the
Pharisee party who controlled many of the synagogues in the region
(and in the Roman Empire). The poor could be identified as the
Christians who were rejected and persecuted by the Pharisees. How
should the Christians respond to the persecution? Treat the
antagonists as if they were welcome to the Christian community. Even
persecution provided an opportunity for evangelization.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:29 Here, Jesus addressed another prime audience for
evangelization: Roman soldiers. To supplement their meager income,
soldiers would beat and steal from the local populace. Such violence
reinforced a policy of Roman intimidation over conquered peoples.
Passive cooperation could shock the soldiers (who expected
resistance) and offer a chance for evangelization.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:30-31 These two verses summarized the teaching on
love of enemy. Give selflessly. Do not seek redress. Treat everyone
the same way. Such behavior opens the door to evangelization.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:32-35 How were Christians different from other Jews
and the pagans? Jesus chose three areas: relationships, ethics, and
charity. Christians were not to simply extend loyalty, good works,
and self-giving to other Christians. Stopping there would not
distinguish followers of Jesus from any other group. No, Christians
were to treat others the same. For they were to see beyond the
present condition. They were to see, not with this world's eyes, but
through heaven's eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:37 &quot;judge . . . condemn . . . acquit&quot; These
three verbs describe the powers of a magistrate. Jesus used legal
terms to remind his followers that these were powers best left to
God, the eternal judge. In a more positive vein, Jesus implied when
people refrained from these activities, they were, in effect, living
in the Kingdom, living as if the Final Judgement had already taken
place. Place yourself under the mercy of a just God, Jesus seemed to
say, and realize life in the Kingdom here and now.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:38 &quot;Good measure (of grain), having been pressed
down, having been shaken together, (and) overflowing, will be given
into your lap (flap of your garment).&quot; This sentence described
the process and distribution of grain by the individual (not by a
mill). The measure was the amount of grain distributed. The grain was
pressed down to separate the grain from the kernel. Then, the grain
was shaken together in order to compress (i.e., &quot;settle&quot;)
the grain into a smaller space. Notice these two verbs in these
clauses were in the past tense, while the next verb (&quot;overflowing&quot;)
is in the present tense, which leads up to the future tense (&quot;will
be given&quot;) verb in the main clause. In other words, the
processed grain was distributed in an overgenerous manner. The person
would form a pocket with the front of their cloak in order to receive
the grain. The sentence represented the distribution of grain in very
prosperous times, when everyone received a surplus.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:39 &quot;For, in what measure you measure, it will be
measured for you.&quot; Many have used this verse to justify a
Christian acceptance of &quot;karma,&quot; the Hindu and Buddhist
notion that the moral universe has an unbreakable law of retribution.
Taken to its logical conclusion, karma maintains that, somehow, rich
people deserve their comfortable lifestyle based upon the past moral
acts.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In the light of Luke 6:20-26, such a notion cannot be
justified. Jesus chided the rich and praised the poor. More
important, Christian faith presents the notion that everything people
have are gifts from God. Gifts cannot be earned or deserved. They are
freely given and received. The believer who freely gives is far more
likely to realize the material and spiritual wealth they have is gift
from God. In other words, the verse should not be read as quantity
(&quot;the stuff I give, I will receive in kind&quot;). It should be
read as quality (&quot;the open heart that gives freely realizes the
great wealth already received and thanks God accordingly&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>As a collection of wisdom quotes, these passages
followed Luke's blessings and curses we studied last week. Jesus gave
us these wise sayings to guide the way we treat those who dislike us.
He summed it up in the Golden Rule: &quot;Treat others as we would
like to be treated.&quot; [31]</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Golden Rule is to be universally applied and not
limited to our family and friends [29-34]. It places the worth of the
person over that of possessions [29-30]. It is meant to include mercy
and forgiveness, since it reminds us of our faults and shortcomings
[36-37]. Hence the Golden Rule can never be a measure of moral
superiority; for, in the moment it becomes one, it judges us to the
extent we judge others [37].</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In a strange way, the Golden Rule allows us to treat
others the way God treats us, with love and compassion even when we
do not deserve it [35]. We are to apply the Golden Rule in a
proactive way, the way Jesus ministered to people; we are to love our
enemies through our actions and our actions are to be blessings
[27-28]. And, as we bless others, God will bless us with abundance
[38].</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Truly applied, the Golden Rule becomes Christianity's
most powerful weapon to evangelize. Unlike David in 1 Samuel 26 who
used mercy to shame his enemy, Jesus urged us to treat enemies so
that they will join us. The Golden Rule is an invitation, not a
weapon.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Catechism Theme: Conscience (CCC 1795-1802)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Golden Rule guides the formation and use of
conscience. The ability to see others the same way we see ourselves
changes the way we think and act. Both are intertwined. A conscience
cannot grow without the Golden Rule. The Golden Rule cannot be
exercised without an act of conscience.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>What exactly is a &quot;conscience?&quot; And, what is
the duty of having a conscience? A &quot;conscience&quot; is the
judgement of the mind about the morality of an action. A person must
follow their conscience if the person is absolutely sure they are
acting in a moral fashion. (1796, 1800)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>But, can a conscience be wrong? Yes, someone's
conscience can be wrong if the person did not use their mind to think
about the reason they did the act, the means they would use, and the
consequences of their act. A conscience can also be wrong if the
person did not seek God's will by: 1) praying to God, 2) studying
about the issue, and 3) talking to other moral people about the
issue.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Prayer, study, and discussion are the means to
developing a good conscience. (1798, 1801, 1802) The best way to
develop a good conscience is simple, however. Use the Golden Rule.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>How have you used the Golden Rule? What happened?</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>We've discussed the evangelical power of the Golden
Rule. As we close, let us reflect on the ultimate Other in the Golden
Rule: God.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In Tolstoy's story, &quot;Martin the Cobbler,&quot; old
Martin waited for Christ to visit him one day. The way he treated
others that day was different from any other day of his life. At the
end of the day, an angel came to Martin. &quot;Why hasn't the Savior
come to see me?&quot; Martin asked. The angel responded that Christ
had indeed come to visit him, in the faces of the people he served
that day.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>When we treat others with the respect we desire, we
treat them as if God were present in them. The Golden Rule allows
Christians to make others sacrament, vessels of God's presence. The
Golden Rule allows us to experience the Kingdom in action. Let's not
delay applying the rule.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
