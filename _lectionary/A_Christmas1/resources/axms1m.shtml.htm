<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<strong>Isaiah 63:7-9</strong>
<p>To understand when the prophet wrote these words, we need to skip forward to the next chapter. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+64%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">64:10</a> speaks of &#8220;Jerusalem a 
desolation&#8221; and <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+64%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">64:11</a>
says, with reference to the Temple, &#8220;Our holy and beautiful house ...
has been burned by fire&#8221;. So this passage was written after the
Babylonian conquest of 587 BC.</p>
<p>The prophet begins by recalling God&#8217;s &#8220;gracious deeds&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) of the past: how he has kept his 
covenant with his people. (&#8220;Steadfast love&#8221;, Hebrew: <em>hesed</em>, is a technical term for this.) He has given freely to them, trusted them (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>) and saved them from danger. In 
&#8220;days of old&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) 
God <em>in person</em>
(&#8220;his presence&#8221;) &#8211; not a &#8220;messenger&#8221; (prophet), not an &#8220;angel&#8221; -
&#8220;saved&#8221; (protected) them, &#8220;redeemed them&#8221; and &#8220;lifted them up&#8221; to him.
We Christians believe that he has been present with us again: in Jesus
being born into the world. V. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>
tells us that God was present with Israel in the days of &#8220;Moses&#8221;; then,
God &#8220;brought them up out of the sea&#8221;. Exodus 15:5,8 tells of God saving
Israel (under Moses) as they crossed the Red (Reed) Sea. Recall also
the finding of baby Moses: Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter &#8220;named him Moses,
&#8216;because ... I drew him out of the water&#8217;&#8221; (Exodus <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+2%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:10</a>).
In the following verses, the prophet is clearly distraught over the
destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. He implores God to again have
compassion on his people. So upset is he that he accuses God of making
people stray from faith! (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>) V. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+63%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>
indicates that the prophet writes after the return from Exile: for
years, the people have been ruled by those who do not consider God to
be king of kings. May God come into their midst, as he did during the
Exodus!</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 148</strong>
<p>The psalter ends with five hallelujah (&#8220;Praise the L<small>ORD</small>&#8221;) psalms, of which this is one. In vv.

travelled on concentric hemispheres above the earth, and above them was
God&#8217;s storehouse of &#8220;waters above the heavens&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+148%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>), the source of rain and snow.

<b>Hebrews</b>
</small><p>
<small>Apart from the concluding verses (which may have been added later), this 
book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a letter. Its name comes from 
its approach to Christianity: it is couched is Judaic terms. The 
identity of the author is unknown; Origen, c. 200 said that "only God 
knows" who wrote Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, 
arguing for the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as 
revealer and mediator of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old 
Testament, the author argues for the superiority of Christ to the 
prophets, angels and Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his 
sacrifice is much more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus is 
the "heavenly" High Priest, making the true sacrifice for the sins of 
the people, but he is also of the same flesh and blood as those he makes 
holy.

<strong>Hebrews 2:10-18</strong>
<p>To ancients, the present world was controlled by angels; however, the &#8220;coming world&#8221; (v.

was not. The author sees the source of the quotation in vv.

as irrelevant, for all scripture is to him the word of God. As
translated here it shows that God has made humans, in this earthly
life, inferior to angels; however in eternal life humans will be
superior to &#8220;all things&#8221; (including angels.) We do not see this now
(&#8220;as it is&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>), 
but &#8220;we do see Jesus&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>)
&#8211; who became human temporarily, and is now exalted (&#8220;crowned&#8221;) as a
consequence of dying. He died so that, as God&#8217;s gift to us, he might
take on our deaths. (See v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>:
Jesus, in sharing our humanity, destroyed the &#8220;devil&#8221;, who caused death
to be separation from God.) God is creator of all things; they exist
for his purposes (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>).
It was per God&#8217;s saving plan (&#8220;It was fitting&#8221;) that God, in bringing
many of us to share eternal life, should bring Jesus, the one who goes
before us (into eternal life) and points the way for us (&#8220;pioneer&#8221;), to
the completion of his mission &#8220;through sufferings&#8221;.</p>
<p>We share with him (&#8220;the one who sanctifies&#8221;, v.

plans) the same &#8220;Father&#8221; (God, and also <em>proto-human</em>, Adam) through the birth of Jesus. This the author demonstrates by quoting from three psalms (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A12-13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12-13</a>). The glorified Christ 
praises God in the midst of the &#8220;congregation&#8221;, <em>ekklesia</em>, church. Perhaps in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a> the author alludes to the 
context in Isaiah: there Isaiah states the trustworthiness of God&#8217;s word &#8211; that others have rejected. (In v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>,
&#8220;flesh&#8221; is human nature, in its weakness.) Hellenistic Judaism held
that God did not plan for humans to die, that the devil introduced
death into the world. Jesus came to help believers (&#8220;descendants ...&#8221;,
v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Hebrews+2%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>), not angels. Christ, as 
compassionate and trustworthy &#8220;high priest&#8221; (v.

death, through removing sin. Jesus was &#8220;tested&#8221; (v.

throughout his life, so he is able to help those whose faith is weakened now.</p>

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

is Israel, the people of God. A verse that recalled God&#8217;s acts to save
Israel from bondage is now applied to Jesus, he who offers to save all
people. (Herod has all the infants in the Bethlehem area killed because
he fears that Jesus may succeed to his throne, rather than a son of
his.) In Jeremiah (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+2%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>), Rachel weeps over the exile

is much like God&#8217;s words to Moses, as he sends him to lead Israel out
of bondage. Jesus is the new leader of God&#8217;s people. Herod Antipas,
Herod the Great&#8217;s son, governed &#8220;Galilee&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+2%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>) benignly compared to the way 
his brother &#8220;Archelaus&#8221; governed Judea. Joseph may also have chosen to make his home in &#8220;Nazareth&#8221; (v.

because he could find work on the reconstruction of neighbouring
Sepphoris. The quotation is not from the Old Testament. Perhaps Matthew
is provoking his readers to think; perhaps he harks back to Isaiah <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+11%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11:1</a>: &#8220;a branch
