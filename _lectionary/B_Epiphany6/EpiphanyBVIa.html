<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">I am expecting 12 people for
this class. Tape four sheets of standard paper taped end-to-end, to
make a long strip 8-1/2 inches wide. Fold this in a fan-fold, six
folds to a sheet, and draw a half-paper-doll shape on the top. On one
side of the long strip, colour irregularly all over it with a white
crayon. In class, we will cut out the long fold of paper dolls. The
paper will probably be too thinck to cut them all out at once, so we
can cut some with skirts and some with pants, some thick and some
thin, so our community has variety. Talk about how, as a church, we
are all joined together in community. We can choose to separate
ourselves from the community, but then we lose its support.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Cut apart the dolls so
everyone has one, and let everyone paint their doll. MAKE SURE
EVERYONE STARTS BY PAINTING THE SIDE YOU COLOURED ON. Leprosy is a
skin-disease that leaves dead white patches on the skin. People who
have leprosy are often cast off from their community. There are other
diseases and conditions that cut us off from our community:&nbsp;
mental illness, hatred and distrust, poverty, intolerance for
differences. Some things -- sins -- cut us off from God, too. But God
keeps reaching out to heal us. When we REPENT -- that means &quot;turn
around&quot;, stop going in wrong directions and start walking in the
way of Christ -- we accept God's healing. (And if we turn our paper
dolls around, and paint the other side, we'll find they don't end up
with any leprous white patches on them).</P>

is like Home-work, except that it is done in the pews, instead of
being done at home. Because it is focussed on the readings (as the
sermon, presumably, also is) it can be done during the sermon to help
the listener concentrate. Or, it can be done while waiting for
everyone else to finish their communion. It isn't done during
prayers, or hymns, or the readings, because</FONT></P>
