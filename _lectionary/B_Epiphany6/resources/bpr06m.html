<B>2 Kings</B>
<P>
The two books of Kings were originally one. They continue the story 
of the monarchy begun in 1-2 Samuel. 1 Kings begins with the 
enthronement of Solomon and the death of David. 2 Kings continues the 
story of the monarchies of Israel and Judah. It covers the period 
from about 850 BC to about 585 BC. During this period, Israel fell to 
the Assyrians (in 721 BC) and Judah to the Babylonians (586 BC). 
While these books read like a political history - in which some kings 
are judged good and others bad - they trace the apostasy that led to 
the loss of national identity and autonomy.

Ben-hadad and Jehoram. If so, this event occurred about 850 BC. The story tells us that Israel's God has made Aram more powerful than Israel: first, note &#8220;the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> had given victory to Aram&#8221; (v.

handle the situation: an enemy is seeking help! But Elisha is confident: he counsels that here is an opportunity for Naaman to learn about God through him (v.

how a prophet of God operates; he expects him to behave like a pagan prophet. Elisha&#8217;s prescription is too simple for him, so he almost rejects it (v.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<STRONG>Psalm 30</STRONG>
<P>The psalmist clearly praises God for his recovery from grave illness, but this psalm may also be allegorical: its title says that it was sung at the dedication of the Temple, which was desecrated in 164 BC and rededicated in 161 BC. 
&#8220;Sheol&#8221;, &#8220;the Pit&#8221;, (v.

the earth where the dead existed as mere shadows. In vv.

to him. He had felt perfectly secure and healthy (v.

Feeling near death, he prayed to God, pointing out that if allowed to go the Sheol, no one, not even God, could hear him. God did hear his prayer and restored him to health and favour (vv.

to joy, even to liturgical &#8220;dancing&#8221;. He will praise God for the rest of his life.</P>

<B>1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<HR>
<STRONG>1 Corinthians 9:24-27</STRONG>
<P>Paul has written that he has been &#8220;entrusted with a commission&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+9%3A17" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">17</A>) from God to spread the 
good news. He has gone beyond what God expects of him, making himself the servant of all, not burdening the Corinthians financially, so that he may bring more to Christ. He has accepted this discipline voluntarily, and &#8220;for the sake of the 
gospel&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+9%3A23" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">23</A>).</P>
<P>Now he presents the metaphor of sports, one familiar to his first readers, for the Isthmian Games (of which the Olympics are a modern imitation) were once held in Corinth. He likens Christian life to track races &#8211; but every metaphor has its 
limitations. It seems that by being believers and joining in the liturgical and sacramental life of the Church some Christians at Corinth thought themselves sure of eternal life &#8211; but the Christian way requires more than this. While we all set 
out on the Way in our baptism, not all persevere as we should. In athletics, one person wins; in Christian life, not all persevere so Paul says &#8220;run in such a way that you may win it&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+9%3A24" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">24</A>). Do this by exercising 
&#8220;self-control&#8221; (v.

whatever your way to Christ. (Paul thinks of other sports too: see v.

received a crown of pine twigs, a &#8220;perishable wreath&#8221; (v.

hard for Christ are rewarded with eternal life. Paul not only exerts great effort but does so purposefully and effectively: a boxer who <EM>beats the air</EM> loses (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+9%3A26" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">26</A>). Paul disciplines his 
&#8220;body&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+9%3A27" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">27</A>) 
and harnesses it to God&#8217;s purposes, lest he be &#8220;disqualified&#8221; from eternal life. Thus he warns his readers.</P>

<B>Mark</B>
<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<STRONG>Mark 1:40-45</STRONG>
<P>At Capernaum Jesus has surprised those worshipping and studying in the synagogue by teaching with a new kind of authority and by healing a mentally disturbed man by command alone. He has then cured Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law of a fever. Later 
people in a crowd have witnessed him curing many. After communing with God in &#8220;a deserted place&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+1%3A35" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">35</A>) he moves on to spread the good 
news in other towns.</P>
<P>Now a leper approaches him in supplication (&#8220;kneeling&#8221;, v.

the essence of God: God chooses whom he heals (and saves). Jesus is &#8220;moved&#8221; (v.

&#8211; thus making himself ritually unclean and risking leprosy himself. Jesus&#8217; stern &#8220;warning&#8221; (v.

anyone&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+1%3A44" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">44</A>), but the man 
ignores it (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+1%3A45" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">45</A>). Jesus does not 
wish to be misunderstood: physical healing is only an indicator of the Kingdom; he is not merely a wonder-worker. For the man to be readmitted to Jewish society, the healing needs to be confirmed by a &#8220;priest&#8221; (v.

sacrifices (&#8220;offer for your cleansing&#8221;) so he could be ritually purified. (The &#8220;testimony to them&#8221; may either be to the crowds or be to the power of God now available to all believers.) Lest he be misunderstood, Jesus 
continues his ministry secretly, &#8220;out in the country&#8221; (v.
