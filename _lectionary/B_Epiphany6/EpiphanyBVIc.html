				&quot;By all means, go,&quot; the king of Aram replied. &quot;I

				&quot;My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great

				tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'!&quot; <SUP>14</SUP> So he went
				down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of

			<P><FONT SIZE=2>Leprosy begins as a localized skin disease.
			Depending on the resistance offered by the body of its victim, it
			may remain localized, or it may spread. It causes nerve
			destruction in the infected areas, causing the victim to lose his
			sense of feeling in those areas. It is this loss of feeling which
			poses one of the greatest dangers to the leper. If he hurts
			himself in one of these areas, he may not recognize his injury, or
			the severity of it, until it is severely infected. Also, leprosy
			tends to destroy its victim's bone tissue in the extremeties. It
			is this bone destruction which sometimes causes the victim to lose
			fingers or toes. </FONT>
