<P>From vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A7-11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">7-11</A>,
we learn that Moses has pitched the tent of meeting, a place where
people could seek God, outside the camp. &ldquo;the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>
used to speak to Moses ... as one speaks to a friend&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>).
The golden calf incident has driven a wedge between God and his
people; they feel separated from God. Now Moses asks: God, you have
told me to lead the people (they were <EM>brought out</EM> of Egypt),
but whom will you &ldquo;send with me&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>),
as a sign of your presence? Our relationship is mutual: I know you
and I acknowledge you. Israel is &ldquo;your people&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>)
as well as mine (even if they are disobedient.) In another
translation, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">14</A>
is a question: God asks, if my presence were to go with you, would it
make you rest easy? Moses answers (v.15): if you will not be present
with us, why did you bring us out here into the desert? How will it
be known that you are with us? (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A16" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">16</A>)
By being with us, we will be your elect (&ldquo;distinct&rdquo;, v.

people, chosen over other peoples. Moses receives assurance that God
will guide Israel (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A17" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">17</A>),
because of the special relationship between him and their leader.</P>
<P>Moses now seeks to know God better, something closer than
friendship, i.e. to see his very glory (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A18" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">18</A>).
God does promise him &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A19" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">19</A>)
and grace (&ldquo;gracious&rdquo;), but God chooses to whom he
reveals himself (&ldquo;show mercy ...&rdquo;) Moses cannot possibly
see God&rsquo;s face: to ancient peoples, to see a god&rsquo;s face
was to invite death. Even so, God does grant him more knowledge than
that he gives to others: he will see his &ldquo;back&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+33%3A23" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">23</A>)
but not his face. In Chapter <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+34" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">34</A>,
God makes a new pact with the people.</P>

<P>This letter opens as did private letters of the time. Paul states
that it is from him and two associates (although he is actually the
author). Silvanus is the Gentile name of Silas, the person who
brought to Antioch the decision of the Jerusalem Council that Gentile
Christians were not required to observe Jewish cultural practices.
The word translated &ldquo;church&rdquo; here can mean any assembly,
so Paul makes it clear: the letter is to the community at
Thessalonica which believes in God as Father and holds the Christ
(messiah) to be his Son, Jesus. A letter began with a greeting, and
Paul uses his usual one: &ldquo;Grace to you and peace&rdquo;.</P>
<P>Paul launches into brotherly affection: he and those with him
remember the members of the church in their prayers, thankful for
their &ldquo;work of faith&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>),
their wholehearted assent to God and his plan for salvation, for
their &ldquo;labour of love&rdquo;, their hard work of active caring
for others, and their &ldquo;steadfastness of hope&rdquo;, their
patient endurance of all suffering in the hope of salvation. (English
has no adequate translation for the words he uses.) This is
happening, he says, because God has &ldquo;chosen you&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A4" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>):
they have embraced the good news not only intellectually (&ldquo;in
word only&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>)
but also in divine action: working abundantly (&ldquo;with full
conviction&rdquo;) aided by the Holy Spirit. Further, he and his
companions found their conversion efforts among them highly
effective. The Thessalonians have become &ldquo;imitators&rdquo; (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A6" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">6</A>)
of Paul and of Christ, being joyful in spite of persecution; they
have become examples for others to imitate throughout the province
(&ldquo;Macedonia&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A7" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">7</A>)
and elsewhere. People know how they were converted from worshipping
false gods represented by &ldquo;idols&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A9" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>),
gods who are lifeless and not what they seem to be &ndash; to
worshipping &ldquo;a living and true God&rdquo;, to awaiting the
second coming of Christ, whom God &ldquo;raised from the dead&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+1%3A10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>),
and who will rescue us from the &ldquo;wrath&rdquo;, the punishment
at the end of time for those who oppose God&rsquo;s ways.</P>

as Jesus was teaching in the Temple, Jewish officials questioned his
authority to do &ldquo;these things&rdquo;, all he has done in his
earthly ministry. Jesus declined to answer the question, for the
answer could only be understood by those with faith. Just before our
reading, we find the parable of the Wedding Feast, which the
Pharisees saw as an attack on them.</P>
<P>Now followers of the &ldquo;Pharisees&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>)

people who supported Herod, the Roman puppet king, and his
successors) &ndash; united only in their desire to get rid of Jesus &ndash;
speak to him. They appear to respect him, but speak with irony. And
then the question, the subject of great debate in Jewish circles:
should we pay the annual poll tax to Rome? (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A17" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">17</A>)
Opinions varied: one group, the Zealots, claimed that God&rsquo;s
people should not be subject to pagan Gentiles. Jesus sees through
their plot; he calls them &ldquo;hypocrites&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A18" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">18</A>)
for pretending to respect him but intending to discredit him. If
Jesus says <EM>yes</EM>, Zealots and other Jews hostile to Rome will
turn against him; if he says <EM>no</EM>, he will risk arrest for
