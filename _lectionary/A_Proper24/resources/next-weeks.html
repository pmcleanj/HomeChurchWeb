<h2>The Pledge of Allegiance</h2>
      

<p>There has been a great deal of press coverage around the debate over the Pledge of Allegiance.  I realize this can be a heated issue.  There are those who want the phrase “under God” to be included and those that don’t.  In some ways the problem begins with the words, “I pledge allegiance to the flag…”<br /><br />

	These lessons before us present similar issues for consideration.  They ask us, “to what and to whom is our greatest loyalty?”  Is allegiance a first amendment or first commandment issue?  It could be argued that the “pledge of allegiance” for the faithful Christian begins with, “I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth…”<br /><br />

	I say that not to be flippant or self-righteous, but to highlight the importance of examining, to what and to whom do we give allegiance.  We are to make no mistake about other gods.   Recall the words of the offertory prayer from the liturgy “Now the Feast and Celebration,”  “Merciful God, everything in heaven and earth belongs to you.  We joyfully release what you have entrusted to us…” <br /><br />

	Today’s readings do not slander government.  They do not support a position that suggests that government and faith are completely incompatible.  They may even lean to the side of showing how God can use civil leaders to accomplish God’s own purpose.  But, wow, does that statement need to be tempered by the admonishment against idols.<br /><br /></p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
      <p>Cyrus is an example of God using even the unexpected “outsider” to do God’s work.  Cyrus was a governmental leader of Persia and was not a believer in Yahweh.  Yet he was anointed by God and called to free the Israelites from their bondage in Babylonia.<br /><br />

	The refrain in this reading, “I am the Lord and there is no other,” recalls the covenant between God and the people of Israel.  It also states that there really is no other God.  Therefore, God is the God of all people, nations, cultures, and governments – not just our own.  When we confess or “pledge allegiance” to the God who is maker of heaven and earth we also confess that there is no place or thing outside of God’s care and concern.<br /> <br />
</p>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the second lesson</h4>
<p>Here again we hear the call to turn away from idols and to “serve a living and true God.”  This letter is written to a young church.  They are praised and admonished to continue in the life to which they are called in Christ.  The next several weeks take the epistle from Thessalonians.  The church is not without opposition and as this letter continues it takes the form of a pastoral letter.<br /><br /></p>

<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
<p>Damned if you do and damned if you don’t – Caught between a rock and a hard place. – A no win situation. – A lose, lose proposition.  Etc.<br /><br />

	How many clichés there are to articulate the situation in which Jesus finds himself in the Gospel reading.  It is a position no one likes to be in.  It can create tremendous anxiety.  When there is no way out panic can set in.  The best option is to avoid being in the situation.  Jesus does just that.<br /><br />

	Jesus sees the ambush coming and takes a different course from the one down which the Pharisees and Herodians try to lead him.  He avoids getting into a power struggle.  If Jesus says it is okay to pay taxes he loses face with the masses suffering under the tax and resent the Roman occupation.  If he says it is wrong to pay taxes, he takes the side of the revolutionaries that advocated the rejection of Roman authority.<br /><br />

	Jesus rejects the simple either/or answer.  His question about the coin shows the image of Caesar so he can have what is his but no more.  The greater truth is that everything belongs to God.  The things that belong to Caesar are his only because God has entrusted them to him.<br /><br />

	Most importantly Jesus teaches that our whole lives belong to God.  Created in God’s image it is God’s inscription that is placed on us at baptism.  “You have been sealed by the Holy Spirit and marked with the cross of Christ forever.”  Therefore, render to God the things that are God’s.  What can we exclude or leave out when our allegiance is to the God, maker of heaven and earth?  What does not belong to God?<br /><br />

	We render to God the “things” that are God’s when we claim our baptismal identity.  Our whole life, talents, time and possessions are God’s and exist to be instruments of God’s love and justice in the world.<br /><br /></p>





<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p class="box_sml">1)	The issues surrounding the separation of church and state are hot topics in our country.  Do these texts offer any insight for you on these issues? </p>




<p>2)	How might you discern your loyalties? </p>




<p>3)	How does serving a “living and true God” differ from serving other gods?
</p>




<p>4)	If you were writing a pastoral letter to a person or community new to the faith what might you say?</p>

<p>5)   When have you been “trapped” or when have you knowingly or unknowingly trapped another?”</p>

<p>6)	We have laws against “entrapment.”  What do you know of them and how does this Gospel inform you?</p>
<p>7)	How can the question, “Show me the money (paraphrased)” assist us when we are trapped as we try to live as faithful people in the world?</p>
