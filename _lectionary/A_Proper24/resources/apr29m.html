<B>Exodus</B>
<P>
Exodus is the second book of the Old Testament, and is part of the Pentateuch,
the first five books of the Bible. Jews refer to these books as "The Torah".
At times, they are referred to as "The Law", although "Torah" means <I>teaching</I>.
Exodus centres on the rescue of God's chosen people from captivity in Egypt
and the making of the great covenant, or agreement with God, at Mount Sinai.

driven a wedge between God and his people; they feel separated from God. Now Moses asks: God, you have told me to lead the people (they were <EM>brought out</EM> of Egypt), but whom will you &#8220;send with me&#8221; (v.

grace (&#8220;gracious&#8221;), but God chooses to whom he reveals himself (&#8220;show mercy ...&#8221;) Moses cannot possibly see God&#8217;s face: to ancient peoples, to see a god&#8217;s face was to invite death. Even so, God does grant him more 
knowledge than that he gives to others: he will see his &#8220;back&#8221; (v.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Thessalonians</B>
<P>
This letter is perhaps the oldest book in the New Testament. 
Paul (with Silvanus and Timothy) founded the church there during his second missionary 
journey, and as is recorded in Acts 17, was forced to leave the city due to persecution. 
Many Greeks who already  worshipped God, many pagans and "important women" became 
Christians. The letter was written from Athens to strengthen the new Christians in their 
faith.

<HR>
<STRONG>1 Thessalonians 1:1-10</STRONG>
<P>This letter opens as did private letters of the time. Paul states that it is from him and two associates (although he is actually the author). Silvanus is the Gentile name of Silas, the person who brought to Antioch the decision of the Jerusalem 
Council that Gentile Christians were not required to observe Jewish cultural practices. The word translated &#8220;church&#8221; here can mean any assembly, so Paul makes it clear: the letter is to the community at Thessalonica which believes in God 
as Father and holds the Christ (messiah) to be his Son, Jesus. A letter began with a greeting, and Paul uses his usual one: &#8220;Grace to you and peace&#8221;.</P>
<P>Paul launches into brotherly affection: he and those with him remember the members of the church in their prayers, thankful for their &#8220;work of faith&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Thessalonians+1%3A3" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>), their wholehearted 
assent to God and his plan for salvation, for their &#8220;labour of love&#8221;, their hard work of active caring for others, and their &#8220;steadfastness of hope&#8221;, their patient endurance of all suffering in the hope of salvation. (English 
has no adequate translation for the words he uses.) This is happening, he says, because God has &#8220;chosen you&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Thessalonians+1%3A4" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>): they have embraced the 
good news not only intellectually (&#8220;in word only&#8221;, v.

action: working abundantly (&#8220;with full conviction&#8221;) aided by the Holy Spirit. Further, he and his companions found their conversion efforts among them highly effective. The Thessalonians have become &#8220;imitators&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Thessalonians+1%3A6" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">6</A>) of Paul and of Christ, 
being joyful in spite of persecution; they have become examples for others to imitate throughout the province (&#8220;Macedonia&#8221;, v.

know how they were converted from worshipping false gods represented by &#8220;idols&#8221; (v.

and not what they seem to be &#8211; to worshipping &#8220;a living and true God&#8221;, to awaiting the second coming of Christ, whom God &#8220;raised from the dead&#8221; (v.

This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <I>sayings</I> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for <I>Quelle</I>, German for <I>source</I>).
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 60 to 70 AD, possibly for a

teaching in the Temple, Jewish officials questioned his authority to do &#8220;these things&#8221;, all he has done in his earthly ministry. Jesus declined to answer the question, for the answer could only be understood by those with faith. Just 
before our reading, we find the parable of the Wedding Feast, which the Pharisees saw as an attack on them.</P>

should we pay the annual poll tax to Rome? (v.

the Zealots, claimed that God&#8217;s people should not be subject to pagan Gentiles. Jesus sees through their plot; he calls them &#8220;hypocrites&#8221; (v.

but intending to discredit him. If Jesus says <EM>yes</EM>, Zealots and other Jews hostile to Rome will turn against him; if he says <EM>no</EM>, he will risk arrest for inciting rebellion against Rome. We know his answer, as translated, but
