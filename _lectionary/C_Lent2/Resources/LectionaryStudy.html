<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Genesis"></A><FONT SIZE=2><B>Genesis is the
first book of the Bible. It begins with two versions of the creation
story, neither of them intended to be scientific but telling us why
we are on earth. In the story of Adam and Eve, it tells us that we
are responsible, under God, for the care of all creation. It then
continues with the stories of the patriarchs: Abraham (who enters
into a covenant (or treaty) with God), Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. </B></FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Genesis 15:1-12,17-18</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>God has called on Abram to leave Ur (now in Iraq) and to &ldquo;Go
... to the land I will show you&rdquo; (12:1). God has blessed him,
and he, his wife Sarah and his brother Lot have migrated to Canaan.
Famine has struck the land, causing Abram and his family to seek food
in Egypt. Pharaoh has been attracted to Sarah, thinking that she is
Abram&rsquo;s sister, taking her into the royal household. When he
has discovered that she is Abram&rsquo;s wife, he has ordered them to
leave the country.</P>
<P>Our reading is two stories of gifts from God: in vv. 1-6, a son
and many descendants; in vv. 7ff, the Land. The formula &ldquo;the
word of the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT> came to ...&rdquo; (vv. 1, 4) is
later used of prophets; Abram is called a prophet in 20:7. God makes
Abram his favourite; he will protect (&ldquo;shield&rdquo;, v. 1)
him. Abram&rsquo;s &ldquo;reward&rdquo; is really a free gift. Custom
was that if a man&rsquo;s wife did not bear him a son, his chief
servant (&ldquo;slave&rdquo;, v. 3), here &ldquo;Eliezer&rdquo; (v.
2), might inherit. God promises Abram a son (&ldquo;your very own
issue&rdquo;, v. 4) and he will have countless descendants (&ldquo;stars&rdquo;,
v. 5). Abram puts his trust in God&rsquo;s promise; in this way, he
establishes a right relationship (&ldquo;righteousness&rdquo;, v. 6)
with God.</P>
<P>God&rsquo;s words in v. 7 are like those he speaks later at Mount
Sinai. But this time, Abram is not so trusting: he asks for a sign or
sworn oath (v. 8). From Jeremiah we know that the ceremony in vv.
9-10 and 17 is of ancient origin. Going between the two halves
(&ldquo;pieces&rdquo;, v. 17) of sacrificial victims signified that
if a party broke the agreement, he could expect to be dismembered. As
in v. 1, Abram has a vision (v. 12): the descent of the sun, &ldquo;deep
sleep&rdquo;, terror and great &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; express the
awesomeness of supernatural intervention. God&rsquo;s presence is
symbolized by fire (v. 17). Only he has obligations under the pact,
so only he passes between the &ldquo;pieces&rdquo;. The <EM>deal</EM>
is <EM>cut</EM> (thus the Hebrew), as are the victims: David&rsquo;s
empire later stretched almost from the Nile to near the upper reaches
of the &ldquo;Euphrates&rdquo; (v. 18). (In the other version of this
story, God changes Abram&rsquo;s name to Abraham to signify his new
relationship to God.)</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
our first reading, God makes a covenant with Abraham (note that in
the text, the name used is &quot;Abram&quot;. Later in Genesis,
chapter 17; verse 5 to be exact, God will expand the covenant with
Abram and change his name to Abraham). Abram complains to God that he
doesn't have a rightful heir. God reassures Abram that he will have
heirs and that his descendants shall be a numerous as the stars in
the sky (the image of the number of which is lost to us 21st century
city dwellers who are lucky we can see a few constellations!).<BR><BR>What
happens next may baffle us. It seems odd to us that God would have
Abram gather a three year old heifer, a female goat and a ram plus
two turtledoves and a young pigeon. It seems even odder (if not
gross) that Abram would then cut the heifer, goat and ram in half.
However even though this is mentioned only a couple of times in the
Old Testament, it seems to be the way some of our ancient ancestors
sealed their covenants (like signing on the dotted line in front of
witnesses for us). God ratifies the covenant in a way that Abram will
understand.<BR><BR>Now, one might say that this is all well and fine
for Abram. Abram receives a covenant from God. But is it all about
just Abram and God? <BR><BR>The answer is no, there is a balance
here. God makes a covenant with Abram concerning his heirs because
his heirs will be a blessing to all the families of the earth
(Genesis 12:3).<BR><BR>Abram is blessed so that he can be a blessing
to others. There's a balance here, one that we need to remember. We
are blessed by God so that we might be a blessing to others.</FONT> </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>How do we know
God is really present? When we have an experience that changes us.
The experience can be a as small as a new feeling or insight, or as
grand as a vision. We measure the experience, not by its depth, but
by the extent it changes us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Abraham had a grand vision, but the way it changed him was found
in the God's gift: descendants and land [5 and 18]. As a wandering
tribe leader, Abraham was a rich merchant (an &quot;import-export&quot;
trader) and herdsman. Descendants were important to him in order to
increase his wealth with cheap family help, and in order to give him
&quot;immortality&quot; through the memory of his sons.
Unfortunately, Abraham's wife was childless.</P>
<P>While land as area was necessary to raise Abraham's sheep and
cattle, a land with secure borders was not as important to Abraham as
it might be to his descendants in order to farm.</P>
<P>Who was this God promising Abraham descendants and land? Abraham's
God was most likely his clan's deity, the God closest to him. In a
world with many gods, there was a deity for every city, every family,
and every purpose. While Abraham might have acknowledged these other
gods, the only God that was important to him was the God who was
closest to him and could deliver on His promises. This was the God in
whom Abraham put his trust [6].</P>
<P>The vision Abraham had was patterned on a covenant ceremony a king
would make to a faithful servant. The covenant was an act of gracious
gift giving; all obligations and penalties of the covenant were
adopted by the king, not by the servant.</P>
<P>The severed animals represented the penalty of the covenant
[9-10]. The people who walked between the torn bodies of the animals
assumed the penalty of the covenant (the people would say; &quot;If I
do not keep the covenant, may I end up as these animals are now&quot;).
Since the smoking brazier and flaming torch that passed between the
pieces represented God, He alone would assume the penalty for
breaking the covenant [17]. God was putting his reputation on the
line as a deity; if He could not deliver on his promises, He was not
worth of Abraham's trust. On the other hand, this ceremony was an
iron-clad guarantee for Abraham; he would receive descendants and
land!</P>
<P>While feeling, insight, and the unexplainable might be measures of
God's presence, personal change is a better measure. For Abraham, the
change was descendants and land; for us, the change is Church, a
place and a community in which to grow closer to God. And these
changes are gifts from God.</P>
<P><I>How has God changed you? Was there a particular moment of
change? Why was that particular moment important?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<P><STRONG>Psalm 27</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The psalmist expresses his confidence in God. &ldquo;Light&rdquo;
is linked with &ldquo;life&rdquo;. When &ldquo;evildoers&rdquo; (v.
2) try to destroy him (&ldquo;devour my flesh&rdquo;), they fail to
do so. Even if they are many (&ldquo;army&rdquo;, v. 3), he is sure
that they will fail. He has asked of God that he may worship in the
Temple (&ldquo;live&rdquo;, v. 4) for as long as he lives, see the
&ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of what God does, to know more of God; these
things he intends to do. God&rsquo;s &ldquo;tent&rdquo; (v. 5) is the
Temple; it is the psalmist&rsquo;s refuge; there God makes him
unreachable by his ungodly foes (v. 6). So he will praise God. He
pursues his request in vv. 7-12. May God allow himself to be seen (v.
9); in the past he has seemed hidden from Israel. May God care for
him (v. 10). May God guide him in godly ways so that he may not
become subject to the &ldquo;will&rdquo; (v. 12) of his foes who tell
lies about him (&ldquo;false witnesses&rdquo;, v. 12). V. 13 is the
conclusion: he trusts that he will see the effects of God&rsquo;s
caring, throughout his life. Possibly v. 14 is a later addition: God
does not act according to our schedule.</P>

wrote to the church at Philippi, a prosperous Roman colony in
northern Greece, from prison. We do not know whether this
imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome. It appears that he was held
under house arrest. It is possible that the epistle is actually made
up of three letters. It contains many personal references, exhorts
members of the Philippian church to live the Christian life and to
good ethical conduct, introduces Timothy and Epaphroditus as his
representatives, and warns against legalists and libertines. Lastly,
he thanks the Philippian community for their material support. </FONT></A>

<P><STRONG>Philippians 3:17-4:1</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul has written: &ldquo;I want to know Christ and the power of
his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like
him in his death&rdquo; (3:10). He has not yet fully understood
Christ, but he <EM>presses on</EM> (3:12) towards the goal of being
with Christ when he comes again. This is how (3:15) &ldquo;mature&rdquo;
Christians should think: they have not yet achieved full
understanding.</P>
<P>Now Paul offers himself as an example of centering oneself in
Christ, in his sufferings. (At the time, Paul was in prison.) Observe
those who follow his (<EM>our</EM>) example! He warns against &ldquo;many&rdquo;
(3:18) who centre on other things: at the end of the age, sadly they
will be destroyed. Who are they? Perhaps self-centred people, but
more likely Christians who insist on keeping Jewish dietary laws
(&ldquo;belly&rdquo;, 3:19) and on circumcision: to boast in this is
to <EM>glory</EM> in an organ which should be modestly covered
(&ldquo;shame&rdquo;). These are &ldquo;earthly things&rdquo;, made
obsolete by Christ&rsquo;s coming. Society looks to Rome for
citizenship but we look to &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; (3:20).</P>
<P>Our bodies, now mortal, will enter eternal life in a changed form,
to achieve union with Christ (3:21). Per Psalm 8, the Messiah will be
sovereign over all (&ldquo;subject to himself&rdquo;); Christ is the
Messiah. Do not deviate from the true faith! (4:1).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
balance revealed in this week's second reading is the tension between
the fact that we are citizens of heaven while also being citizens of
the earth. This portion of Philippians follows the great Christ hymn
of Philippians 2:5-11. In that hymn, St. Paul describes how Jesus,
though equal with God, became human in order to serve humanity. In a
sense, Jesus was as Jesus said of his followers that they are &quot;in
the world but not of the world.&quot; <BR><BR>In our text Paul states
that we are citizens of heaven and our minds should not be set on
earthly things. However, that does not mean that we are to embrace
the extreme view that because our citizenship is in heaven we should
have nothing to do with the earth or its people. Unfortunately that
view has been held at many times in Church history much to the
detriment of the ecology and the marginalized. <BR><BR>As we travel
through this Lenten season, we do indeed think about the fact that we
are not of this world. Our allegiances lie with God and Jesus Christ.
However we also remember by the Lenten discipline of almsgiving that
we are here for a purpose and that is to serve God and our neighbor
in this world, at this time, in this place.<BR><BR>By keeping the
balance we maintain a healthy sense of discipleship. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P>3:17-18 In the context of 3:2, the &ldquo;enemies of the cross&rdquo;
were Judaizers, Jewish Christians who insisted that Gentiles convert
to the mother religion before they could follow Christ. Paul objected
to such conversions because, as conduits to life in the chosen
assembly, they became more important than the sacrifice of Christ on
the cross itself.</P>
<P>In this light, the phrase &ldquo;(their) god is the belly&rdquo;
was not a reference to a gluttonous life, but to an insistence upon
the kosher laws. The phrase &ldquo;(those) perceiving (only) the
earthly (things)&rdquo; referred to adherence to the duties of the
Law. Paul held their insistence upon regulation on diet and focus on
the Law would lead to the shame and destruction of the Judaizers.</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Philippians has presented some problems
to readers. There has been some controversy among biblical scholars
about the editing and redaction of the letter. Harsh turns in style
and subject have given rise to theories that the letter was actually
a composite gleaned from two or three different letters. Nonetheless,
most scholars insist Paul did write the sections that compose the
present &ldquo;letter.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At the heart of the letter, Paul really intended to warn the
faithful against a traditional group of Jewish Christians. These
&ldquo;Judaizers&rdquo; insisted that the way to salvation in Christ
lie in circumcision and life under the Jewish Law. As the note above
stated, Paul saw such a prerequisite diminishing the power of the
cross to save. Since Paul experienced his own salvation outside the
Law (in a vision on the road to Damascus), he vehemently opposed
those who claimed the way to salvation in Christ was through the Law.
What the Gentile Christians had received, Paul insisted, was good
enough. The &ldquo;Judaizers&rdquo; were concerned with the ways of
daily living, but Christians should look to heaven and the source of
their salvation. Christ, not the Law, had the power to transform the
faithful at the end. In him, the faithful should stand firm.</P>
<P>The Judaizers were focused on the routines of daily duty. Paul was
focused upon the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>The routines of daily living are extremely important. They provide
a sense of self-control and practical limitations. So, they can lead
to the growth of virtue. Our routines can strengthen, but not
replace, our faith. If they do, then, we will assume control over our
faith, in the same way we control our routines.</P>
<P>Routines come from the self, as means to live day by day. Faith is
a gift from God, that blesses, but ultimately transcends, the daily
routine.</P>
<P><I>Has your faith life ever gotten in a &ldquo;rut?&rdquo; Could
you blame that rut on a routine? Have good spiritual habits helped
you out of a rut? What happened?</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or
quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. Its author,
traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a
collection of sayings (known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own
source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the
disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a
more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote
primarily for Gentiles. </FONT></B>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Luke 9:28-36</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus has predicted his suffering, death and resurrection to his
disciples; he has called on them to &ldquo;take up their cross&rdquo;
(v. 23), has warned that those who hear the gospel but fail to trust
in it will be condemned, and has promised that some present will see
the kingdom of God. Now he and the inner circle of disciples ascend
&ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; (v. 28). In Luke, Jesus always prays
before an important event.</P>
<P>An aura of unnatural brightness is linked with mystical
appearances in Exodus and Acts; &ldquo;dazzling white&rdquo; (v. 29)
is a symbol of transcendence. In Jewish tradition, both &ldquo;Moses
and Elijah&rdquo; (v. 30) were taken into heaven without dying.
Jesus&rsquo; agenda is in accord with the Law and the prophets; he is
doing God&rsquo;s will.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Two men&rdquo; also appear at the resurrection and at the
ascension. Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;departure&rdquo; (v. 31, <EM>exodos</EM>
in Greek) is his journey to Jerusalem and his passage from this
world. Peter clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand; perhaps he thinks he
is witnessing a <U>super</U> Feast of Tabernacles (&ldquo;dwellings&rdquo;,

The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; (v. 34) is a symbol of God&rsquo;s presence;
the words from it recall Jesus&rsquo; baptism, and add &ldquo;listen

may see this as a stretch but bear with me. In this week's gospel,
the Pharisees, of all people, come to warn Jesus that Herod wants to
kill him. Why would the Pharisees who have been such critics of Jesus
come to warn him? No one seems to know or to even speculate. In
nearly all other references to the Pharisees they are seen as enemies
of Jesus who are waiting for the right time to catch him in some
religious mistake so they can discredit him.<BR><BR>Herod on the
other hand has already killed John the Baptist. John you will recall
criticized Herod for marrying his brother's widow along with other
things (see Mark 6:17ff for the full story). So, to believe that
Herod is out to kill Jesus is not a stretch.<BR><BR>Jesus hears the
warning and replies that he will not stop his ministry out of fear of
Herod. In fact, Jesus gets a little &quot;dig&quot; in on Herod.
Jesus calls Herod a &quot;fox&quot; denoting that Herod is sly and
cunning even to the point of using deceit. Jesus, on the other hand
does his ministry in public, in plain view of everyone.<BR><BR>Next,
Jesus laments for Jerusalem, the place of Kingly power, of political
power. But Jesus notes that Jerusalem kills the prophets sent to
correct the people. Here Jesus uses another animal image, but this
time the image is of a mother hen who seeks to gather and protect her
brood under her wings. However, Jerusalem is stubborn and will not
turn to God or Jesus, but would rather trust in political power and
in itself.<BR><BR>The balancing act here for me, is seen in the
balance between maintaining the status quo and heeding the gospel
that often calls for reform and change particularly as it applies to
establishing justice and caring for the marginalized of society.
Often we become comfortable with political and institutional systems
that maintain our position in the world. We become comfortable with
our class and status and do not want to risk losing it. And sometimes
this desire to keep the status quo can lead us into sin when we are
not willing to look at it critically, always asking the question what
is God's will and call at this moment of time for our institutions
and ourselves.<BR><BR>Herod killed John and wanted to kill Jesus
because they threatened Herod's power. The religious leaders of the
day sought to trap Jesus because he was upsetting the religious laws
of the time (eating and working on the Sabbath for example), and the
Romans persecuted the early Christians because they were &quot;turning
the world upside down&quot; (see Acts 17:6). Today's gospel
challenges us to look consider if anything we or our faith
communities are doing that serves us or our institutions instead of
God and God's people. This is not always an easy task for in our
comfortability we often miss the log in our own eye while looking to
the speck in our neighbor's eye. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H4 CLASS="western">Looking to the Future in a Rearview Mirror</H4>
<P><I>What do people fear about the future? Why do they harbor such
fears?</I></P>
<P>As much as we are focused on the present moment, we Americans like
to peer into the future. To see visions of what can be, to dream
about what is possible. To let go of the baggage from the past, to
feel the freedom of tomorrow.</P>
<P>Of course, change means the instability of the unknown. So, we may
no longer want to rush to the future. We may want to conserve what we
have and what we understand.</P>
<P>The stress we feel in our culture is the tussle between the rocky
rush to the future and the comfort the past gives. We might be pulled
between the fresh and the stale. But, we stand between the
uncertainty of the unknown and the certainty of the already known.</P>
<P>Peter and his partners followed Jesus up the mountain to pray.
There, they experienced a vision that gave them a choice. What was to
be vs. what they relied on.</P>
<P>Peter, John, and James experienced the unexpected. Peter reached
into his knowledge of the past to put the experience into context.
This is a natural human tenancy. But, Peter and his friends did not
fully realize the implications their experience had on the future.</P>
<P>Personal change may be reflected in past experience, but it can be
of an unknown origin, or even the promise of the future. We need
trust in God's will to cope with such change. And we find God's will
in prayer.</P>
<P>Jesus invited his earliest disciples and closest friends to pray
with him [28]. Several verses earlier in Luke, Jesus revealed the
type of Messiah he would be; he predicted his death and resurrection.
Now it was time for the power and meaning of the prediction to set
in; so, Jesus prayed and shared his prayer time with Peter, James,
and John.</P>
<P>The power and meaning of Christ's prediction revealed themselves
as a heavenly vision. Glorified, Jesus discussed his coming death
with the two pillars of the Jewish faith: Moses, the Law giver, and
Elijah, the first of the prophets [29-31]. The presence of both
represented the two divisions of the Jewish Scripture, the Law and
the Prophets. Hence, the discussion between Jesus, Moses, and Elijah
symbolized the Passion as the fulfillment of Scripture.</P>
<P>Did Peter, James, and John fully understand the implications of
Jesus' prediction and its meaning? Hardly. They were asleep; not only
were they in slumber (the literal meaning of sleep), they didn't
understand (the figurative meaning of being asleep) [32]. This scene
would be repeated when Jesus took these same disciples with him to
pray at the Agony in the Garden.</P>
<P>From his slumber and lack of understanding, Peter wanted to build
three booths or tents [33]. Tents built on the side of a mountain
were references to the Festival of Booths, when the Jews had a
post-harvest celebration. During the multi-day festival, people lived
in temporary shelters around Jerusalem. At one point they carried
plam branches into a procession. In the centuries before the birth of
Jesus, the festival took on Messianic overtones:</P>
<P>And there shall be continuous day (it is known to the Lord), not
day and not night, for at evening time there shall be light.</P>
<P>And the Lord will become king over all the earth; on that day the
Lord will be one and his name one.</P>
<P>Then every one that survives of all the nations that have come
against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King,
the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of booths. (Zechariah 14:7,
9, 16 RSV)</P>
<P>The symbols were all here: the light, the central focus on Jesus,
climbing the mountain to worship (just as Jerusalem was built on a
mountain). But Peter wanted to celebrate a past revelation (i.e.,
Moses and Elijah as the Law and the Prophets: the Jewish Scripture)
and a past understanding of the Messiah (i.e., Jesus as the political
and religious Messiah). 
</P>
<P>Peter failed to realize Jesus was speaking about a future event
and a future revelation. The past meant no change, but the future
meant uncontrollable change. The past merely required certainty; the
future required faith. In his fear, Peter lacked faith; he just
didn't know what he was saying.</P>
<P>To confirm the revelation, the cloud and the voice from heaven
(both symbols of God's presence) appear. From the cloud the Father
affirms his Son's prediction with the words: &quot;This is my chosen
Son; listen to him.&quot; The word of God given through the Law and
the Prophets was now given through Jesus. The focus of the past now
became the focus on the future.</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: Divine Providence and the Promise of the Future
(CCC 321-324)</P>
<P>We may take comfort in the past, in the Tradition of Faith. And so
we should. But that comfort should not mask the possibilities the
future holds. Ultimately, change lies in the hands of God, in divine
providence.</P>
<P>What is divine providence? Divine Providence is the wise and
loving act of God which guides all creation from its origin to its
ultimate end. We take part in divine providence by freely cooperating
with God's plan for our lives, to trust in God's will. Even when we
place our trust in God, we can still experience the results of sin.
After all, evil lurks in the world.</P>
<P>Why does God permit evil in the world? When we ask this question,
we can also ask, &quot;Why did the Son of God die on the cross?&quot;
The answer to both questions is the same: to allow a greater good to
come from the evil. Christ died in order to rise from the dead. The
faith that believes in the risen Lord will also give us hope that a
greater good comes from an evil act.</P>
<P>At the Transfiguration, Peter, John, and James experienced the
living tradition of the past and the promise of salvation in the
future. But, that promise came at a price. The death of the Master
they loved.</P>
<P><I>What challenges to faith have you experienced? How did God
guide you through them? Did your experience of divine providence
increase your faith in God? Why or why not?</I></P>
<P>We Christians may not be immune from the stresses of future
promise. But, we have a unique perspective on the future. We look
forward to God's will and the coming of the Lord in glory through the
eyes of a faith two millennia old. We are, in effect, looking at the
future through a rearview mirror. Such a view should not blind us to
the possibilities of the future. It should just give our view
perspective.</P>
<P>How should we cope with future shock? How did Jesus? In prayer.
Prayer is time with God's will and our future. How we spent that time
is a clear measure of our trust in God and his ways that change us.</P>
<P><I>The challenge of the future should give us pause. And a chance
to pray. What challenges lie on your horizon this week? How have you
placed them in prayer? </I>
