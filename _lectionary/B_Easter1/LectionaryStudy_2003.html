<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to
the right date. Easter tells the story of the Resurrection. Over the
&ldquo;Week of Weeks&rdquo; of Easter, we will be called to accept
the Miracle of the Resurrection. Here is our memory scripture for
Easter:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary
the mother of James, and Salme, brought sweet spices, that they might
come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of
the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. And
they said among themselves, Who will roll us away the stone from the
door of the sepulchre? And when they looked, they saw that the stone
was rolled away: for it was very great. And entering into the
sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, cloted in
a long white garment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto
them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was
crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they
laid him. But go your way, thell his disciples and Peter that he
goeth before you inot Galilee: there will ye see him, as he said unto
you.</I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Last week we transferred our chosen decorations to the
cross. We were short of time (and a Dremmel wrench) for carving them
into the cross, so we did that at home during the week. Now we're
ready to stain the patterns and varnish the cross.&nbsp;

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>From
the readings, we see that we can't second-guess what God is going to
do. Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem didn't end how his
disciples expected: it ended in his death. Jesus crucifixion didn't
end as the priests and pharisees expected: it ended in his eternal
life. The cross, a symbol of shame, has become a symbol of Salvation.
Our ugly, rough cross has become smooth, beautiful and colorful. With
all the unexpected changes God can create, what do you think God
might be changing in you?&nbsp; </FONT>

Hand-outs</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
