				<P><FONT SIZE=2><SUP>43</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph of
				Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the
				kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved
				the body of Jesus.<BR><SUP>44</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pilate
				marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the
				centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
				dead.<BR><SUP>45</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he knew it of
				the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.<BR><SUP>46</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
				he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the
				linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,
				and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</FONT></P>

				and anoint him.<BR><SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very early
				in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the

				they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from
				the door of the sepulchre?<BR><SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
				when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it
				was very great.</FONT></P>

				them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was
				crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where
				they laid him.<BR><SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But go your way,
				tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into
				Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.<BR><SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
				they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
				trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man;
				for they were afraid.</FONT></P>
