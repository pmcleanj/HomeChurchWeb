<B>Acts</B>
<P>
This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<P>The Greek here is rough, full of grammatical errors, unlike the rest of Acts, so we may well have Peter's unedited words. He tells the assembled company that God does not favour Jews over others: anyone, whatever his nationality, who reveres God

<B>Isaiah</B>
<P>
This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Corinthians</B>

Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<STRONG>John 20:1-18</STRONG>
<P>Early on Sunday morning, before dawn, Mary Magdalene (witness to Jesus&#8217; death and burial) comes to the tomb and finds that the &#8220;stone&#8221; door has been rolled back, so she and those with her (&#8220;we&#8221;, v.

disciple&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A3" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>, traditionally 
John) that they suspect that someone has removed the body. The &#8220;other disciple&#8221;, apparently younger, outruns Peter (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A5" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>). But the orderliness of the 
&#8220;cloth&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A7" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">7</A>) and 
&#8220;linen wrappings&#8221; show that the body has neither been stolen nor spiritualized.</P>
<P><EM>John</EM>, when he sees, comes to trust that God is active; by implication, Peter does not understand yet. They do not yet understand the significance of what is occurring (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A9" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>), of how it fits into God&#8217;s 
plan, because they have not yet received the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Mary, still thinking that the body has been moved, has returned to the cemetery. In her grief, she sees &#8220;two angels in white&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A12" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>), heavenly messengers. She 
recognizes Jesus when he calls her by name. But something has changed: they are in a new relationship: &#8220;do not hold on to me&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+20%3A17" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">17</A>). To John the evangelist, 
Jesus&#8217; crucifixion, resurrection, exaltation and return to heavenly glory, his ascension, are parts of a single event.</P>

<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<STRONG>Mark 16:1-8</STRONG>
<P>On Saturday after sundown, &#8220;when the sabbath was over&#8221;, Mary Magdalene (witness to Jesus&#8217; death and burial) and others buy spices to anoint Jesus&#8217; body. (Because Jesus died only hours before the Sabbath, there was no time 
to anoint it before he was buried. Buying spices on the Sabbath was permitted, but not aromatic oils and salves used for burial preparation.)</P>
<P>Early on Sunday morning (&#8220;the first day of the week&#8221;, v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+16%3A2" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>), they go to the tomb, wondering 
who will roll away the heavy disk-shaped &#8220;stone&#8221; (v.

out of the rock, and the &#8220;stone&#8221; ran in a track.) But they find the tomb open (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+16%3A4" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>) and realize what the empty tomb 
means: &#8220;&#8216;he has been raised&#8217;&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+16%3A6" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">6</A>).</P>
<P>The &#8220;young man, dressed in a white robe&#8221; (v.

probably sits on a shelf intended for a body. It is the faithful women who first hear the Easter message. In v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+16%3A7" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">7</A>, the angel tells them to inform the 
disciples that he &#8220;is going ahead of&#8221; them, will appear to them in Galilee, just as he told them during his earthly ministry. The women flee, seized with &#8220;terror and amazement&#8221; (v.
