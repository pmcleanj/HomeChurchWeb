<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Mark 16:1-8	

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Christ is Risen

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“He has been raised; he is not here.”

<P>Questions:
<BR>“The task on Easter (which is every Sunday for an Easter-based faith) is to tell stories about resurrection in a world where everyone dies” (Richard W. Swanson, Provoking the Gospel of Mark: A Storyteller’s Commentary, Year B).  The high point of the church year is upon us, no matter the state of the world around us, personally or communally.  And yet our Marcan text is short and even mysterious, leaving us with no appearance of a risen Jesus to put a “nice ending” to the story of suffering and death. Instead, as Douglas Hare puts it, “Mark’s story of Jesus’ ministry, passion, and resurrection terminates abruptly with fear, flight, and silence” (Mark, Westminster Bible Companion).  Or does it?  The story of the resurrection of Jesus, Hare says, is not primarily about Jesus but about a God who is powerful enough to raise Jesus up. “Seen in this light, the resurrection of Jesus must be regarded as God’s comment on the crucifixion” (Hare).  Our text from Jeremiah two weeks ago claimed that desolation was not God’s last word, or comment, on the people of Israel.  Instead, God spoke a new word, a word of hope and new life in a new covenant written on their hearts.  On Easter Sunday, we celebrate this God’s “comment” on the death of Jesus, the assurance that God’s final word is not death and despair but resurrection and new life. In this world “where everyone dies,” where is your hope?  Where have you and your congregation seen life out of death?  Were there some who refused to believe, and others who could not find their voice or their courage to share that good news?  If the women in the story have brought aromatic oils to honor the body of Jesus, they are greatly frustrated in that task by the surprising things God is doing.  Have you ever been so focused on your task that you missed a great wonder unfolding before your eyes? What do the words “terror and amazement” tell you about the experience of the women at the tomb?  How does it strengthen the power of this story?  What do you think happened one hour after they fled, since we know that their story was eventually shared?

<P><B>Acts 10:34-43</B>

<P>Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”

<P><B>Isaiah 25:6-9</B>

<P>	On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples
	a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines,
	of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear.

<P>	And he will destroy on this mountain
	the shroud that is cast over all peoples,
	the sheet that is spread over all nations;

<P>	he will swallow up death forever.
	Then the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from all faces,
	and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth,
	for the LORD has spoken.

<P>	It will be said on that day,
	Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us.
	This is the LORD for whom we have waited;
	let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

<P><B>1 Corinthians 15:1-11</B>

<P>Now I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you—unless you have come to believe in vain.
For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them—though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.

<P><B>John 20:1-18</B>

<P>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.

<P>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.

<P><B>Mark 16:1-8</B>

<P>When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

<P><B>Luke 24:13-49</B>

<P>Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?” He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.” Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?” Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.

<P>As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

<P>While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.

<P>Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”

<P>Easter Day
<BR>April 16, 2006
<BR>Mark 16:1-8

<P>RESURRECTION MORNING
<P>According to the Gospel of John, the dawn of the first Easter was anything but promising. Jesus had been humiliated, crucified, and buried three days earlier. It is hardly surprising that the men who were his disciples were nowhere to be seen. After all the wonder and excitement, it came to this–Jesus was dead! And they were terrified. Separated from their dreams they experienced the radical absence of hope, and the absence of hope, for them, signaled the absence of God, what St. John of the Cross called the “dark night of the soul,” and they had gone into hiding behind locked doors. Only the faithful Mary Magdalene stood by the tomb.
    Then Jesus came to them–first to Mary at the tomb and then to the locked room. Just how he did that we do not know, but Jesus moved through their closed doors and their secure walls. Shocked and full of doubt and fear, they could not trust their own eyes. Still Jesus persisted. He said, “Do not be afraid of what you see.” With these words, the peace of God drove out fear, doubt, and hopelessness and the disciples recognized him and rejoiced.
    So the beauty of the story of the first Easter morning is this: Faith is not certainty of belief. It is trust and the perseverance of hope, and God will not let the disciples or us remain in doubt and despair. God’s spirit just keeps coming to us again and again–sometimes in the concrete personal experiences that we share; sometimes in the sheer wonder of our world. “Do not be afraid of what you see,” said Jesus. “Do not fear what you see before you.” Beyond despair and fear, resurrection is the sign of the renewal of divinely given hope and courage. We know this, and like Thomas, the most doubtful of all the disciples, the outcome is our confession–confession of the overwhelming power of trust in God’s love ever seeking us to offer us new hope and new ways of believing.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
