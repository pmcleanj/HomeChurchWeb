said, I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose
own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep.
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for
the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of
this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and
there shall ge one flock, and one shepherd. </I>

Statement: &ldquo;Go and do likewise.&rdquo; Questions: Seekers of
spiritual wisdom have probably existed in every age and every place.
The Letter to the Colossians offers a prayer that &ldquo;you may be
filled with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s will in all spiritual wisdom
and understanding, so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord,
fully pleasing to God, as you bear fruit in every good work and as
you grow in the knowledge of God.&rdquo; Some people say that
&ldquo;feeling follows thought,&rdquo; but one might also say that
&ldquo;doing follows understanding.&rdquo; What happens when our
faith, our trust, our belief translate into action, individually and
as a congregation and as a denomination? What does that look like?
What are ways that your church expresses its understanding of God&rsquo;s
wisdom in &ldquo;every good work&rdquo;? How might that understanding
deepen, grow, expand? How does the United Church of Christ
expression, &ldquo;To believe is to care; to care is to do&rdquo;
relate to this question? What does it really look like when we &ldquo;bear
fruit&rdquo;?What do you think is really in the heart of the lawyer
who &ldquo;stood up to test Jesus&rdquo;? In his question, is he
seeking spiritual wisdom and understanding? What does it mean that he
tried to &ldquo;justify himself&rdquo;? Is something working on him?
Has he made the connection between spiritual wisdom and understanding
on the one hand, and his own actions (&ldquo;every good work&rdquo;?)
on the other? Do you ever identify with him? While the parable of the
&ldquo;good&rdquo; Samaritan is one of the most familiar stories from
the Gospels, it&rsquo;s the one we mostly get wrong. (If, indeed, one
can &ldquo;get&rdquo; a parable &ldquo;right&rdquo;!) We can&rsquo;t
seem to turn the situation around and understand that, according to
Jesus, the one who is helping is &ldquo;being&rdquo; the neighbor,
not the needy, broken person in the ditch. We think we should help
those in need, but isn&rsquo;t it easy to see ourselves somehow in a
superior position to those we help? When we think about our
obligations as good and faithful people, isn&rsquo;t it easy to see
ourselves as the one who helps, rather than the one who is being
helped? And then, what happens if we receive help from those we
despise, or dislike, or disapprove of, or at least avoid? What
happens when we put ourselves in the place of the one in the ditch?
(What are the ditches in our lives?) Who are the people whose help we
would prefer to receive, if indeed we have to accept the help of
another? Are their people in our lives who are &ldquo;Samaritans&rdquo;
in the sense that we see them as &ldquo;other,&rdquo; perhaps as
enemy, or maybe as someone beyond our narrowly prescribed
&ldquo;neighborhood,&rdquo; and therefore, certainly not our
neighbor? On the other hand, is it sometimes easier to send money to
people far away, and not see the people in our own neighborhood,
literally or figuratively? Is it easier to send missionaries far away
than it is to be in mission in the neighborhood surrounding our own
church, or perhaps in the city nearest to us? How does this story
told by Jesus challenge us, push us, disturb us? Do you ever feel
that it is somehow comforting to express &ldquo;the law&rdquo; in
such simple, clear terms as loving God with all your heart, and with
all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind;
and your neighbor as yourself? How might we see &ldquo;laws&rdquo; in
general as flowing out of these two basic, related commands?</FONT> </FONT></FONT>

Hand-outs</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
