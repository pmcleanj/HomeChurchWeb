<b>Deuteronomy</b>
</small><p>
<small>Deuteronomy is a book of instruction, or torah. It is the fifth book of the Bible. 
It recasts Israel's mission and destiny, mostly by restating the history of the 
people recorded in the first four books. It emphasizes teaching and learning for 
all generations. Moses speaks on God's behalf, with authority, to the assembled 
people of Israel, as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.

<strong>Deuteronomy 18:15-20</strong>
<p>This book claims to be Moses&#8217; final words to the Israelites, as they
prepare to enter the Promised Land. He has told them that they are not
to indulge in magic as the Canaanites do; it is to end such &#8220;abhorrent
practices&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) that God, through the 
Israelites, is driving out the native people. God demands complete loyalty (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>); he does not permit 
occult practices (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>). Now 
recall the Israelites&#8217; request after God gave Moses the Ten Commandments at Sinai (&#8220;Horeb&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>): while they have learnt 
that &#8220;God may speak to someone [i.e. to Moses] and still live&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+5%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:24</a>), they have feared that 
too much direct contact with God may lead to their deaths: that &#8220;this great fire will consume us&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+5%3A25" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:25</a>). God has agreed to 
Moses being a prophet, a channel of communication between him and his people.</p>
<p>Now God, through Moses, promises: to help them remain loyal, he will
&#8220;raise up a prophet [or line of prophets] like me [Moses] from among&#8221;
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A15" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15</a>) them. God will speak 
through him, and he will repeat God&#8217;s words to the Israelites (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>). Anyone failing to heed 
God&#8217;s commands will be held &#8220;accountable&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>),
i.e. God will condemn them. God will also deal with false prophets: any
prophet who falsely claims to speak in God&#8217;s name, or speaks contrary
to God&#8217;s will, will die (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>). If what a prophet 
predicts does not happen, he is not God&#8217;s messenger (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+18%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>). In later Judaism, v.

was seen as referring to a future prophetic figure from heaven. Recall
that, after Jesus feeds the five thousand, the people say &#8220;&#8216;This is
indeed the prophet who is to come into the world&#8217;&#8221; (John <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+6%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6:14</a>).</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 111</strong>
<p>This is a hymn of praise to God for his great deeds, especially for
making and keeping his covenant with Israel. The psalmist is a wise
person, for whom holding the Lord in awe is the beginning of knowing
him (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+111%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10a</a>) and for whom wisdom comes 
from increasing knowledge of God. He speaks from his innermost being, his &#8220;whole heart&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+111%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>), in the select group 
(&#8220;company of the upright&#8221;) and in &#8220;the congregation&#8221;. He praises God for his &#8220;works&#8221; (v.

part of God&#8217;s proclamation after he replaced the stones bearing the
Commandments &#8211; a symbol of renewal of the covenant. He nourishes those
who hold him in awe. His works include the gift of Palestine (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+111%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6b</a>), his interventions in the

commandments. What he does lasts forever (v.

&#8220;holy and awesome&#8221; (v.

<b>1 Corinthians</b> 
</small><p>
<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<strong>1 Corinthians 8:1-13</strong>
<p>In <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+7%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:1</a>,
Paul says: &#8220;Now concerning the matters about which you wrote ...&#8221; In
today&#8217;s reading, he continues to answer the Christians at Corinth, with
advice. Much of the meat sold in markets was left over from pagan
festivals. Some members of the community had scruples about eating such
meat, but others considered such scruples to be irrelevant, even to the
point of showing contempt towards these &#8220;weak believers&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>). Such an attitude seems 
to have been disrupting the community. Paul is on the side of liberalism, but not at all costs.</p>
<p>The quotes are from the <em>strong,</em> those smart people who have thought through the theology. In v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>,
Paul warns against being headstrong with knowledge: knowledge can be
dangerous; what really matters is &#8220;love&#8221;: it builds the community. Real
knowledge of God (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>), the &#8220;necessary 
knowledge&#8221;, is realizing that being known by God, in love, is what really counts.</p>
<p>Smart people know that the Greco-Roman gods don&#8217;t exist (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>),
that only God exists, so sacrificing to gods is meaningless, and should
not concern us. In speaking about God as the source and destination of
all that is, we should not forget Christ&#8217;s role as mediator in creation
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). <em>The weak</em>,
he says, have not yet matured in their thinking as Christians: they
have not yet shed their cultural attachments to idols; they feel that
eating sacrificial meat is disloyal to Christ.</p>
<p>Then vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A8-9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8-9</a>: in arguing 
that what one eats is irrelevant, the <em>strong</em> should be careful that their libertarian attitude does not impede the progress of &#8220;the weak&#8221; towards God. Then v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A10-11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10-11</a>: if they see 
<em>strong</em> people joining in festive meals (often held in temples)
where such meat is served, might they not be tempted back into
idolatry? So in joining in such meals you weaken the faith of fellow
Christians: this offends Christ. Finally v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+8%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>: in spite of his 
liberalism, if eating this meat might cause anyone to falter in the Way of God, he will abstain from all meat.</p>

<b>Mark</b>
</small><p>
<small>As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <i>John Mark</i> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<strong>Mark 1:21-28</strong>
<p>Mark has just told us about the calling of Peter (&#8220;Simon&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>),
Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee. Our passage tells us of the
recognition of Jesus&#8217; authority, both in word and deed. He and his
disciples go to Capernaum, a prosperous town on the Sea of Galilee. A
synagogue was where Jews met to gain a fuller understanding of their
tradition through study and worship. (At the time, it was probably not
a building set apart for study and worship.) Anyone with sufficient
knowledge could teach. The &#8220;scribes&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>)
were specialists in the interpretation and application of Mosaic law to
daily life. They frequently quoted scripture, but Jesus (on this
occasion) does not: he speaks directly, confident of his authority.</p>
<p>The &#8220;man with an unclean spirit&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">23</a>) was, in our terms, 
<em>possessed</em>: he was under the influence of evil forces. In
Jewish terms, he was under Satan&#8217;s direction, separated from God. The
devil, speaking through this man (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>),
asks what Jesus is doing meddling in the domain of evil; he recognizes
who Jesus is and that his coming spells the end of the devil&#8217;s power.
He understands the significance of the coming Kingdom. Wonder-workers
of the day healed using ritual or magic, but Jesus exorcises simply
through verbal command (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A25" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">25</a>), so clearly he is divine. V. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Mark+1%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>, on the lips of the crowd, 
acknowledges Jesus&#8217; authority in word and deed.</p>
