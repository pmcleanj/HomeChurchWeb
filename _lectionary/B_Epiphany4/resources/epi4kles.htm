</font><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+2">Mark 1: 21 - 28</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+2">Luke 4: 31 - 37</font></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">According to <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/mark.htm">Mark</a>,
as soon as <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/jesus.htm">Jesus</a> began to teach, he began to heal
people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">This point is not made as firmly in
the other three Gospels, but we will find in these stories from Mark that,
for Jesus, healing and teaching always came together in Jesus' message of
the goodness of <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/god.htm">God</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">The synagogue was a place in the local
community where observant Jews came together to pray to God and to study
God's word. Sacrifices were made only in the <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/pent14mart.htm">Temple</a>
in <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">Capernaum was a small town on the northwestern
shore of the Sea of Galilee in <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/palestin.htm">Palestine</a>. It
may have been the hometown of <a href="http://www.sundayschoollessons.com/peter.htm">Peter</a> and Andrew.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">1. Where was Jesus teaching?</font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">2. Why were the people amazed
at Jesus' teaching?</font></i></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">[Jesus taught with authority, as though
he was surer of his subject than other teachers].</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">3. Who did the man with the evil
spirit say that Jesus was?</font></i></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">[The man with the evil spirit said,
"You are God's Holy One."]</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">4. What did Jesus say to the
evil spirit?</font></i></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">[Jesus said, "Be quiet and come
out of that man."]</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="+1">5. What did the people say about
Jesus?</font></i></b></p>

spirits obey him."]</font></p>
