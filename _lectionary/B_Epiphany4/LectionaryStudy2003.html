Previous Lessons</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>As this was the
first lesson, we didn't review an actual previous lesson. However,
the children present had memorized John 1:1-14 over Christmas. Also,
last week, the priest and pastor had pointed out to the children the
green vestments and hangings. They had explained how different
colours show different Church seasons, and that the season we are in
now is Epiphany.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>When we
finished the song, I asked the children what they thought of when
they thought of the &ldquo;Sun and Stars, the Earth and Moon and
Jupiter and Mars&rdquo;. I reminded them that &ldquo;all things were
made by Him, and without him was not anything made that was made&rdquo;.
Not only did God create the Sun, it's light reminds us that &ldquo;in
Him was Life, and that life was the Light of Men&rdquo;. The children
then (voluntarily and eagerly) recited John 1:1-14 together.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><I><B>Craft</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>I showed the
children a piece of hardboard, on which I had drawn a circle as big
as the hardboard would accommodate, with a hole drilled in the
centre. I gave one child a yellow circle to cut out from a sheet of
paper, while the other cut out a circle of yellow flames, sized to
fit well inside the hardboard circle. Other children could have cut
out four-to-eight small blue disks and tiny green continental land
masses, but since I only had two children, I cut them out myself. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>We talked about
how when God created the Sun and the Earth, God also created the
seasons. As the earth moves around the sun, the seasons pass in
succession. Christmas comes at the darkest time of the year. We glued
the yellow paper disk centred on the hardboard circle, glued its ring
of flames around it, and glued a little blue disk at the bottom of
the hardboard circle with the northern half of its continental
landmass pointing away from the sun. We lightly marked on the circle
where Saint-Jean-Baptiste day would be, then Lady Day and Michaelmas,
then Candlemas (which happened to be this Sunday). Over that we
sketched in the season of Epiphany.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Epiphany means
&ldquo;discovery&rdquo;. During Epiphany, we remember how people
discovered who Jesus was. The wise men discovered Him by following a
star. Anna and Simeon discovered Him prophetically, when He was
brought to the temple by His parents. While He was going about His
ministry, people discovered Him by the things He taught and did.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
