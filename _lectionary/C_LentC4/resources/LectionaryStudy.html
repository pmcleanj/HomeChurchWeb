<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joshua </B></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Joshua tells of the conquest of the Promised Land
(Palestine). God had promised to their forefathers that they would
one day occupy this territory. The book begins with the crossing of
the Jordan. It then relates the stories of military victories,
achieved under his guidance, through which the people of Israel came
to control all of the hill country and the Negev Desert. It describes
the allotment of land to each of the tribes and ends with Joshua's
final address to the people. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Joshua 5:9-12</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The Israelites have entered the Promised Land. Circumcision has
not been practised since leaving Egypt. It being forty years since
they crossed the Reed Sea, none of the males have been circumcised:
&ldquo;The warriors who came out of Egypt perished [on the way], not
having listened to the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>&rdquo;
(v. 6). V. 9 is problematic. Perhaps the author uses &ldquo;rolled
away&rdquo; (Hebrew: <EM>galal</EM>) because it rhymes with &ldquo;Gilgal&rdquo;.
Perhaps &ldquo;disgrace of Egypt&rdquo; refers to the abject social
status the Israelites had there: they were slaves. Perhaps God is
saying: <EM>my rescue of you is complete</EM>. Another interpretation
is: in circumcision (see vv. 2-5), the foreskin is &ldquo;rolled
away&rdquo;; in Genesis 34:14, for an uncircumcised foreigner to
marry an Israelite woman would be a &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; for
Israel. In thanks for God&rsquo;s gift of the Promised Land, the
Israelites are circumcised and celebrate two feasts: Passover (v. 10)
and Unleavened Bread (v. 11). This is the time of the full moon, the
&ldquo;fourteenth day&rdquo; (v. 10) in the lunar calendar. A later
law says two things about Passover: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">men must have been circumcised to
	join in it, and 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>lamb must be eaten. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Because the men were uncircumcised and only manna was eaten in the
desert, this is the first celebration of the feast since leaving
Egypt. &ldquo;Manna&rdquo; (v. 12) is no longer needed, for they can
now live off the harvest. One life ends, and another begins.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Life's Transitions</H4>
<P>Life transitions are difficult. Some are joyful, like a moving
into a new job or a better house, the arrival of children or
grandchildren. Some are painful, like the loss of a spouse or
employment. These transitions require personal change in new and
uncontrollable directions. Sometimes the best way to face these
transitions is to celebrate them.</P>
<P>In the first reading, Joshua prepared the people to enter the
Promised Land. The days of nomadic survival were over; the time of
conquest and settlement were at hand. Just the people celebrated
Passover before they past through the Red Sea to freedom, the people
ate the Passover before they crossed the Jordan River into Palestine.
So, Passover became a transition ritual. It bid farewell to life in
the desert (represented by the manna that disappeared); it welcomed
the life of settlement (represented by the promised yield of the
land) [12]. It celebrated transition with the rations that they had:
unleavened breaded and parched grain [11].</P>
<P>Our rituals of transition (weddings, baptisms, funerals) mark a
goodbye and a hello. And sometimes it marks a return.</P>
<P><I>How do you celebrate rituals in your life? How are they
transition points?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Psalms</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 32</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The psalmist tells us what he has learned in life: happiness is
having one&rsquo;s sin forgiven and taken away (&ldquo;covered&rdquo;)
by God, and enjoying a clear conscience (v. 2). In vv. 3-5, he states
his experiences: he was seriously ill (&ldquo;your hand was heavy
upon me&rdquo;) and was in pain (&ldquo;groaning&rdquo;), both signs
of his alienation from God. (Illness was commonly regarded as
punishment for sin.) He acknowledged his sin and did not continue his
waywardness (&ldquo;I did not hide ...&rdquo;, v. 5); he confessed to
God, and God forgave him. Now v. 6: those who are faithful to God are
not in danger of dying when gravely ill (&ldquo;distress&rdquo;, v.
6). (The &ldquo;waters&rdquo; are a symbol of death.) He is now
protected by God (v. 7). Perhaps God speaks in vv. 8-9: he will lead
the psalmist in his ways, through instruction and counsel. Don&rsquo;t
be like &ldquo;a horse or a mule&rdquo; (v. 9) who must be coerced
into action: use your initiative in being open to God. V. 11 is
spoken to the congregation in the Temple: rejoice in the Lord!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2 Corinthians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This is a letter, written in the style common in the
first century AD. From the text, we know that Paul wrote it in
Macedonia after leaving Ephesus, probably in the autumn of 57 AD. It
gives us a picture of Paul the person: an affectionate man, hurt to
the quick by misunderstandings and evil-doing of his beloved fellow
Christians, yet happy when he can praise them. The letter's prime
intent is to combat evils which have arisen in the Christian
communities in the Achaian peninsula of Greece. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>2 Corinthians 5:16-21</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Some have criticized Paul for being ineffective in persuading
others to follow Christ. Motivated by &ldquo;love of Christ&rdquo;
(v. 14), his approach is not to promote himself &ldquo;in outward
appearance&rdquo; (v. 12) but rather to challenge the conscience. He
is convinced that Jesus &ldquo;died for all&rdquo; (v. 14) and &ldquo;was
raised&rdquo; (v. 15) for all, so living for oneself, rather than for
Christ, is pass&eacute;.</P>
<P>So he no longer judges anyone by worldly standards (&ldquo;human
point of view&rdquo;, v. 16) as he once did (when he was a Pharisee)
in thinking that Jesus was rightly put to death. He now sees Jesus as
the risen one, the reconciler. By &ldquo;new creation&rdquo; (v. 17),
he probably means <EM>a new standard of judgement</EM>, set by Christ
for the Church, by which its members (&ldquo;in Christ&rdquo;) live:
they have been radically changed. In the process of reconciliation,
of returning humankind to oneness with God, he <EM>mediates</EM>, he
tells God&rsquo;s message of forgiveness to people. He (the <EM>we</EM>
is <EM>editorial</EM>) is God&rsquo;s representative in the world,
God&rsquo;s agent (&ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo;, v. 20). He does not
coerce, but rather <EM>entreats</EM>, acceptance of God&rsquo;s offer
of his gift of forgiveness. In v. 21, Paul does <U>not</U> say <EM>made
Christ a sinner</EM>; he means <EM>to bear our sin</EM>: Jesus was
sin-less, yet became part of sinful humanity, as mediator with God &ndash;
in order that we might attain unity with God.</P>

How many times have we heard that phrase? Life&rsquo;s inequities are
matters of fact, not opinions that can be debated.</P>
<P>The root of life&rsquo;s inequities is sin. Life isn&rsquo;t fair
because we are all sinners, living together in a moral universe. Sin
denies us rights and entitlements. Life isn&rsquo;t fair because we
fail one another.</P>
<P>What&rsquo;s the answer to this dilemma? Should we remain on this
merry-go-round of hurt and cynicism and resentment that builds walls
between us? In these short verses from Second Corinthians, Paul gave
us God&rsquo;s answer to the problem: reconciliation. He forgave us.
We experience that forgiveness in a relationship with Jesus Christ.
But he offers more than forgiveness. He offers us intimacy. When we
are in Christ, we are as close to the Father as his Son is.</P>
<P>What is our responsibility for such closeness? Evangelization. We
are to tell others about the Good News of God&rsquo;s reconciliation.
More important, we are to live that evangelization. We are to forgive
others.</P>
<P>Life isn&rsquo;t far. That why God gave us forgiveness.</P>

</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 15:1-3,11b-32</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The dregs of society (&ldquo;tax collectors and sinners&rdquo;)
coming to Jesus causes the religious leaders (&ldquo;the Pharisees
and the scribes&rdquo;, v. 2) to wonder whether Jesus sees anyone as
beyond God&rsquo;s mercy. To explain, Jesus tells three parables: the
Lost Sheep (vv. 4-7), the Lost Coin (vv. 8-10) and the Lost (or
Prodigal) Son (vv. 11-32). In all three, the recovery of what was
lost is cause for rejoicing. There are no limits to God&rsquo;s
mercy.</P>
<P>Briefly, the story of the Lost Son is this: the younger son leaves
home and squanders his inheritance (vv. 12-16); finding himself a
hungry outcast resorting to Gentile ways (feeding &ldquo;pigs&rdquo;,
v. 15), he decides to return to his father (vv. 17-19); his father,
who seeks him, welcomes him back (v. 20); the son confesses, and his
father celebrates his return (vv. 21-24a); the elder son returns (vv.
24b-25); he learns the reason for the festivities (v. 26-27); he
accuses his father of favouritism (vv. 28-30); the father explains
the situation to him (vv. 31-32). In the context of first-century
Palestine, several things look out of the ordinary: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for a son to ask his father for
	his share of the inheritance would be like a <EM>death wish</EM>; 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">no older self-respecting Jew would

	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>a father would demand a full display of repentance, not the
	truncated one of v. 21. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Clearly Jesus tells a somewhat unrealistic story to make a point.
Allegory is at work: each character stands for someone other than
himself: the younger son for the &ldquo;tax collectors and sinners&rdquo;
(v. 1), the elder for the religious authorities, and the father for
God. Jesus makes three points: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the younger son could return home
	&ndash; so all sinners may repent and turn to God; 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the father sought the son (he saw
	him while &ldquo;still far off&rdquo;, v. 20) and offered him
	reinstatement &ndash; so God seeks people out to restore them; and

</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>the good brother begrudges his father&rsquo;s joy over his
	brother&rsquo;s return &ndash; so those who are godly should welcome
	God&rsquo;s extension of love to the undeserving. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The parable raises a question: at the end of the era, will godly
people be ready to be joyous in sharing the Kingdom with reformed
sinners and a God who loves them?</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When are 'second chances' fair?</I></P>
<P>We all get second chances in life. Chances to start over. Chances
to right a wrong. Chances to make a difference. Of course, many times
second chances are not fair or just. But, when we received our
personal second chances, did we deserve them or were they gifts?</P>
<P>The religious leadership criticized Jesus for gathering sinners
around him. In response, he told the most famous parable about second
chances ever recorded.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">15:2
The religious leaders objected to the fact Jesus built his ministry
upon the tax collector and the sinner. Many urban Jewish leaders
stressed purity in worship and lifestyle. Such an outlook encouraged
exclusion. The rural background of Jesus gave him a wider vision of

&quot;destroy.&quot; The &quot;lost&quot; were those who acted in a
self-destructive way. &quot;Lost&quot; in this sense parallels
&quot;death.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">The Pharisees criticized Jesus for the
focus of his ministry: the outcasts. In response, Jesus told a
parable of the lost, the righteous, the loving father of both, and
the great party that brought all three together. [1-3]</P>
<P>According to Jewish custom, a younger son received one-third of an
inheritance at the death of the father, but it could be divided
during the father's lifetime. In the parable, the younger son not
only &quot;cashed out&quot; his inheritance in an economic sense; he
rejected his cultural and religious birthright when he moved from his
home (Israel) to a foreign country. To use another economic saying,
the younger son &quot;sold (Judaism) out.&quot; [11-12]</P>
<P>When the young man spent his inheritance foolishly, he found that
he was truly a foreigner, someone without a home. To survive, he was
willing to work as a swine herder; since Jews considered pigs
unclean, the young man made himself unclean. Now he was truly alone,
for no Jew even living in a foreign country would help him. The local
pagans even despised him; they would not feed him pig food. [13-16]</P>
<P>Repenting, the son decided to return home and accept any
punishment given him. But, instead of punishment, the son received a
party with a place of honor from his father. The father rejoiced, for
his son, dead to the family and the community, was now alive. [17-24]
The early followers of Jesus could see themselves at the celebration;
the ritual was baptism itself, the sign of repentance, rebirth, and
new life with the Father.</P>
<P>The older son jealously objected to the celebration of his younger
sibling's return [25-30]. The older son represented the Pharisees.
Pharisees held that God could be pleased when the Law was faithfully
followed in the smallest detail. They could not understand the
Christian point of view; sinners who did not keep the Law could
please God by repenting.</P>
<P>If the Pharisees could not understand the impact of repentance,
then they could not understand its connection with resurrection. God
raised Jesus up after physical death; he raises sinners up after
moral death. To turn again to God is to be &quot;raised up&quot; by
God, to be given a second chance. [31-32]</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: The Sacrament of Second Chances (CCC 1486-1492)</P>
<P>The Sacrament of Reconciliation or Penance is a sacrament of
second chances. Also known as the sacrament of conversion,
confession, or penance, the Sacrament of Reconciliation forgives sins
committed after Baptism. We can sin after Baptism, for sin hurts God
(it denies God's honor and love), ourselves (it denies our dignity as
children of God), and other people (the Church). (1487)</P>
<P>In spite of sin, God continually calls us back. How? God leads us
back to himself and to the Church through his grace. This movement is
called repentance or conversion; it consists of sorrow for past sins
committed and a firm promise not to sin in the future. (1489, 1490)
There are two types of repentance:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If repentance is based upon a love
	for God, it is called &quot;perfect contrition&quot;; such
	contrition forgives mortal sins if the intention to receive the
	sacrament of reconciliation (as soon as reasonably possible) is
	present. (1492, 1459) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If repentance is based upon other reasons (fear or guilt), it
	is called &quot;imperfect contrition.&quot; (1492) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The sacrament of reconciliation consists of a penitent's actions
and the priest's absolution. The penitent's actions are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">repentance (an examination of
	conscience and true sorrow for sins committed). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">confession of sins to the priest. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>the intention to repair damage done and actions to repair
	such damage. (1486, 1491) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The sacrament allows the penitent the chance for self-honesty,
spiritual counseling, and the opportunity to right past wrongs. In
the absolution, the priest recognizes the process of conversion in
the penitent, and declares it complete. Indeed, sin has been
forgiven.</P>
<P><I>How have you celebrated conversion this Lent? How have you
encouraged those around you to do the same?</I></P>
<P>The story of the Prodigal Son was as much a story of transition as
it was of second chances. Let us remember that second chances are
invitations to transition; let us consider the importance of
celebrating second chances. Christianity is a lifelong celebration of
second chances, not a presumption of God's mercy. That is why we have
the Sacrament of Reconciliation, a chance the wipe the spiritual
slate clean, a chance to start anew as a child of the Father.</P>
