<b>Joshua</b>
</small><p>
<small>Joshua tells of the conquest of the Promised Land (Palestine). God had promised to 
their forefathers that they would one day occupy this territory. The book begins 
with the crossing of the Jordan. It then relates the stories of military victories, 
achieved under his guidance, through which the people of Israel came to control all 
of the hill country and the Negev Desert. It describes the allotment of land to each 
of the tribes and ends with Joshua's final address to the people.

<strong>Joshua 5:9-12</strong>
<p>The Israelites have entered the Promised Land. Circumcision has not been 
practised since leaving Egypt. It being forty years since they crossed the Reed 
Sea, none of the males have been circumcised: &#8220;The warriors who came out 
of Egypt perished [on the way], not having listened to the voice of the 
L<small>ORD</small>&#8221; (v. 6). V. 9 is problematic. Perhaps the author uses 
&#8220;rolled away&#8221; (Hebrew: <em>galal</em>) because it rhymes with 
&#8220;Gilgal&#8221;. Perhaps &#8220;disgrace of Egypt&#8221; refers to the 
abject social status the Israelites had there: they were slaves. Perhaps God is 
saying: <em>my rescue of you is complete</em>. Another interpretation is: in 
circumcision (see vv. 2-5), the foreskin is &#8220;rolled away&#8221;; in 
Genesis 34:14, for an uncircumcised foreigner to marry an Israelite woman would 
be a &#8220;disgrace&#8221; for Israel. In thanks for God&#8217;s gift of the 
Promised Land, the Israelites are circumcised and celebrate two feasts: 
Passover (v. 10) and Unleavened Bread (v. 11). This is the time of the full 
moon, the &#8220;fourteenth day&#8221; (v. 10) in the lunar calendar. A later 
law says two things about Passover: </p>
<ls>
<li>men must have been circumcised to join in it, and </li>
<li>lamb must be eaten.</li>
</ls>
<p> Because the men were uncircumcised and only manna was eaten in the desert, 
this is the first celebration of the feast since leaving Egypt. 
&#8220;Manna&#8221; (v. 12) is no longer needed, for they can now live off the 
harvest. One life ends, and another begins.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 32</strong>
<p>The psalmist tells us what he has learned in life: happiness is having 
one&#8217;s sin forgiven and taken away (&#8220;covered&#8221;) by God, and 
enjoying a clear conscience (v. 2). In vv. 3-5, he states his experiences: he 
was seriously ill (&#8220;your hand was heavy upon me&#8221;) and was in pain 
(&#8220;groaning&#8221;), both signs of his alienation from God. (Illness was 
commonly regarded as punishment for sin.) He acknowledged his sin and did not 
continue his waywardness (&#8220;I did not hide ...&#8221;, v. 5); he confessed 
to God, and God forgave him. Now v. 6: those who are faithful to God are not in 
danger of dying when gravely ill (&#8220;distress&#8221;, v. 6). (The 
&#8220;waters&#8221; are a symbol of death.) He is now protected by God (v. 7). 
Perhaps God speaks in vv. 8-9: he will lead the psalmist in his ways, through 
instruction and counsel. Don&#8217;t be like &#8220;a horse or a mule&#8221; 
(v. 9) who must be coerced into action: use your initiative in being open to 
God. V. 11 is spoken to the congregation in the Temple: rejoice in the Lord!</p>

<b>2 Corinthians</b>
</small><p>
<small>This is a letter, written in the style common in the first century AD. From the text, 
we know that Paul wrote it in Macedonia after leaving Ephesus, probably in the autumn 
of 57 AD. It gives us a picture of Paul the person: an affectionate man, hurt to the 
quick by misunderstandings and evil-doing of his beloved fellow Christians, yet happy 
when he can praise them. The letter's prime intent is to combat evils which have arisen 
in the Christian communities in the Achaian peninsula of Greece.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>2 Corinthians 5:16-21</strong>
<p>Some have criticized Paul for being ineffective in persuading others to 
follow Christ. Motivated by &#8220;love of Christ&#8221; (v. 14), his approach 
is not to promote himself &#8220;in outward appearance&#8221; (v. 12) but 
rather to challenge the conscience. He is convinced that Jesus &#8220;died for 
all&#8221; (v. 14) and &#8220;was raised&#8221; (v. 15) for all, so living for 
oneself, rather than for Christ, is passé.</p>
<p>So he no longer judges anyone by worldly standards (&#8220;human point of 
view&#8221;, v. 16) as he once did (when he was a Pharisee) in thinking that 
Jesus was rightly put to death. He now sees Jesus as the risen one, the 
reconciler. By &#8220;new creation&#8221; (v. 17), he probably means <em>a new 
standard of judgement</em>, set by Christ for the Church, by which its members 
(&#8220;in Christ&#8221;) live: they have been radically changed. In the 
process of reconciliation, of returning humankind to oneness with God, he 
<em>mediates</em>, he tells God&#8217;s message of forgiveness to people. He 
(the <em>we</em> is <em>editorial</em>) is God&#8217;s representative in the 
world, God&#8217;s agent (&#8220;ambassadors&#8221;, v. 20). He does not 
coerce, but rather <em>entreats</em>, acceptance of God&#8217;s offer of his 
gift of forgiveness. In v. 21, Paul does <u>not</u> say <em>made Christ a 
sinner</em>; he means <em>to bear our sin</em>: Jesus was sin-less, yet became 
part of sinful humanity, as mediator with God &#8211; in order that we might 
attain unity with God.</p>

<small><img alt="Symbol of St Luke" src="clnt4m.shtml_files/stluke.jpg">
</small></center>
<small><br>
<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. 
Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his 
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of 
sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes 
God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and 
lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses 
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Luke 15:1-3,11b-32</strong>
<p>The dregs of society (&#8220;tax collectors and sinners&#8221;) coming to 
Jesus causes the religious leaders (&#8220;the Pharisees and the 
scribes&#8221;, v. 2) to wonder whether Jesus sees anyone as beyond God&#8217;s 
mercy. To explain, Jesus tells three parables: the Lost Sheep (vv. 4-7), the 
Lost Coin (vv. 8-10) and the Lost (or Prodigal) Son (vv. 11-32). In all three, 
the recovery of what was lost is cause for rejoicing. There are no limits to 
God&#8217;s mercy.</p>
<p>Briefly, the story of the Lost Son is this: the younger son leaves home and 
squanders his inheritance (vv. 12-16); finding himself a hungry outcast 
resorting to Gentile ways (feeding &#8220;pigs&#8221;, v. 15), he decides to 
return to his father (vv. 17-19); his father, who seeks him, welcomes him back 
(v. 20); the son confesses, and his father celebrates his return (vv. 21-24a); 
the elder son returns (vv. 24b-25); he learns the reason for the festivities 
(v. 26-27); he accuses his father of favouritism (vv. 28-30); the father 
explains the situation to him (vv. 31-32). In the context of first-century 
Palestine, several things look out of the ordinary: </p>
<ls>
<li>for a son to ask his father for his share of the inheritance would be like 
a <em>death wish</em>; </li>
<li>no older self-respecting Jew would <em>run</em> (v. 20) to his son; </li>
<li>a father would demand a full display of repentance, not the truncated one 
of v. 21.</li>
</ls>
<p>Clearly Jesus tells a somewhat unrealistic story to make a point. Allegory 
is at work: each character stands for someone other than himself: the younger 
son for the &#8220;tax collectors and sinners&#8221; (v. 1), the elder for the 
religious authorities, and the father for God. Jesus makes three points: </p>
<ls>
<li>the younger son could return home &#8211; so all sinners may repent and 
turn to God; </li>
<li>the father sought the son (he saw him while &#8220;still far off&#8221;, v. 
20) and offered him reinstatement &#8211; so God seeks people out to restore 
them; and </li>
<li>the good brother begrudges his father&#8217;s joy over his brother&#8217;s 
return &#8211; so those who are godly should welcome God&#8217;s extension of 
love to the undeserving.</li>
</ls>
<p> The parable raises a question: at the end of the era, will godly people be 
ready to be joyous in sharing the Kingdom with reformed sinners and a God who 
loves them?</p>
