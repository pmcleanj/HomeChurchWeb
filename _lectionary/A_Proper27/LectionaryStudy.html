<P>The people of Israel are now residents of Canaan. According to
this book, the conquest is complete. The land has been divided among
the tribes. We leap forward to the final chapter of the book. The
people (or their representatives) gather at Shechem, on the eastern
edge of the hill country, some 50 km (30 miles) north of Jerusalem.
Shechem was the site of a pagan shrine. Here Abraham built an altar
to commemorate his meeting with God; here Jacob, returning from
Haran, set up camp, bought land, and erected an altar; here Joseph
was buried. Our reading describes a treaty between God and his
people, in the general style of treaties between a victorious king
and a vanquished people, <EM>vassals</EM>. Such treaties say: <EM>in
return for protecting you ..., you are obligated to ...</EM> But what
really matter to us are the <EM>differences</EM> from a typical
treaty, what makes this an agreement between God and Israel.</P>
<P>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>,
God&rsquo;s titles are given. (&ldquo;Terah&rdquo; was Abraham&rsquo;s
father, who &ldquo;served other gods&rdquo;.) Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A2-13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2-13</A>
is the <EM>whereas</EM> section: the background, the reason why the
parties wish a treaty. V. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">14</A>
states Israel&rsquo;s obligations: &ldquo;to revere the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>
...&rdquo;. V. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A22" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">22</A>
speaks of witnesses, but (then and now) it is odd that the witnesses
are parties to the agreement. This treaty, unlike others, is <EM>light
on the curses</EM>: what will happen if either party breaks the oath;
v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A20" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">20</A>
says &ldquo;if you forsake the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT> ...&rdquo;
But this verse is discordant with the rest of the reading and with
Israel&rsquo;s experience during the Exile, so perhaps it was
inserted later, as a lesson for people of a later age who were
straying from worshipping God. V. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A25" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">25</A>

documents.</P>

are really separate from the treaty. The people have a free choice as
to whether they worship God or the local gods, but Joshua and his
household elect to serve God (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Joshua+24%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>).
The people, recognizing all God has done for them, do choose to serve
him. (&ldquo;Beyond the River&rdquo;: the river is the Euphrates, so

</P>
<P>This psalm, used at major festivals, tells the story of the people
of Israel from the Exodus to the reign of David &ndash; as a way of
teaching that God has continued his saving acts in history in spite
of the unfaithfulness of his people. The Hebrew word translated
&ldquo;parable&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+78%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>)
has a wide meaning; here it means <EM>wise</EM> instruction &ndash;
based not only on knowledge but also on long experience, of God&rsquo;s
ways. It is important that coming generations know about God and his
marvellous interventions in human affairs (his military &ldquo;might&rdquo;,

and &ldquo;wonders&rdquo;); may his deeds of the past not be

</P>
<P>Paul has just urged his readers to live a godly, ethical life
&ldquo;because the Lord is an avenger&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+4%3A6" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">6</A>).
When? According to Wisdom, the wicked will be punished at the Last
Day. This brings up an important question (&ldquo;we do not want you
to be uninformed&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+4%3A13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>,
is Paul&rsquo;s way of saying <EM>this is important</EM>!): we know
that the destiny of the faithful who are alive at the end of time is
to be with God, but what about those who have already died?</P>
<P>We want you to understand, he says, about the faithful (&ldquo;those&rdquo;)
who have died (literally, <EM>are asleep</EM>), so that your grieving
will be limited to what is natural upon the loss of a dear one; that
you <U>not</U> share in the pagan belief that the dead are caught up
in nothingness (&ldquo;grieve as others do&rdquo;). Christians have a
certain hope: because we believe in the crucified and risen Christ,
through him, God will bring those who are asleep into his company (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+4%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">14</A>).
Those who are alive at the End will have no advantage over those who
have died. (He includes himself among those who will still be alive.)
Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+4%3A16-17" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">16-17</A>
express a basic truth in terms of the cosmology of the day (with
heaven above and the earth below): at the time of the second coming,
God will descend, those who are already dead will rise, then we who
are alive will ascend, joining those already dead. Thus we will all
be with God for ever.</P>

<P><STRONG>Matthew 25:1-13</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The foregoing verses (<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A45-51" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">24:45-51</A>)
are a parable about a master who leaves his household for a time, and
suddenly returns. If, while he is away, his servant lives a godly,
ethical life, he is &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; when the master returns. On
the other hand, if he, realizing that the master is delayed in
returning, misbehaves and lives a life of debauchery, he will be
condemned upon the master&rsquo;s return. In fact, he will be <EM>caught
in the act</EM>, because the master will return when he least
expects. Jesus is speaking in another way (in an allegory), about the
relationship between how we live now and what our fate will be at the
Second Coming; the master stands for Christ.</P>
<P>Our reading is also a parable about the end of time, the Second
Coming. For the bridegroom to be &ldquo;delayed&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>)
was normal at Jewish weddings, but vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A10-12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10b-12</A>
would be surprising to Jesus&rsquo; audience. Each of the wise
bridesmaids has made her preparation; she is prepared spiritually but
preparedness cannot be transferred to others, so their refusal to
give oil to the foolish bridesmaids may be intended to show that <EM>each
one of us</EM> is expected to make our own preparation &ndash; by
living a godly, ethical life. Two surprising events, the door being
shut (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>)
and the failing to recognize the foolish bridesmaids (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>),
are probably another way of saying that the unprepared will be
refused entry to the Kingdom &ndash; just as the wicked servant will
be punished. We are to be prepared at all times for the end of the
age, the Second Coming of Christ. (In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>,
the Greek translated as &ldquo;Keep awake&rdquo; can be rendered as
<EM>be prepared</EM>.)</P>
