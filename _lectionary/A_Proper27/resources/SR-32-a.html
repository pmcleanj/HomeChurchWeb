<h4>Hope in the Resurrection</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>13 Brothers and sisters, we really want you to
know what is happening with Christians who have died. We don't want you
to grieve, like those who don't have hope in the resurrection. 14 If we
believe Jesus died and rose again, then we can trust God will join
those who have died with the risen Jesus.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>15 With the power of God's word, we can state
the following: We who are alive when the Lord returns will not go to
heaven before those who have died. 16 For, at his command which will
sound like the shout of an archangel or the blast of God's trumpet, the
Lord will come down. Then, he will raise up Christians who have died.
After that, he will take the risen and those of us who are alive to
meet with him in heaven! At the same time! That way, we will always be
with the Lord. 18 Encourage each other with these words of hope!</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>13 We certainly did not want you to be ignorant,
brothers, about those sleeping (in death), so that you might not
grieve, just as the living not having hope. 14 For if we believe that
JESUS died and rose (again), so as well, through JESUS, God will lead
(those) having fallen asleep (in death) with HIM. 15 For we say this to
you in the word of the LORD, that we, the living, the ones having been
left behind for the parousia of the Lord, certainly will not precede
(those) having fallen asleep (in death), 16 for the LORD himself, with
a command, with the shout of the archangel and with the trumpet of God,
will descend from heaven, and the dead in CHRIST will rise up first, 17
then we, the living, the ones left behind, will be taken up with them
at the same time for a meeting with the LORD in the air. Thus we will
always be with the LORD. 18 So, encourage each other with these words.</b></p>
<p class="indent">4:13, 15 "certainly" indicates the presence of a double negative ("not...not") in Greek. The double negative adds emphasis.</p>
<p class="indent">4:15 "parousia" is a theological term that refers to the Second Coming.</p>
<p class="indent">4:16 " with a command, with the shout of the
archangel and with the trumpet of God" These are three different images
referring to the same event, not three successive events. In other
words, the command and the angel's pronouncement and the trumpet blast
are all the same sound.</p>
<p class="indent">4:17 Many Christians refer to this verse to support
their belief in the "rapture." They hold this "rapture" will be the
first in a series of events that marks the end times. However, in
context, this verse simply refers to an "ascension" of the just after
the Last Judgement. In other words, Paul was using a parallel between
Jesus and his followers. What happened to Jesus after his death and
resurrection will happen to the faithful at the end of time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the salutation of 1 Thessalonians, Paul praised the community with the three theological virtues:</p>
<p class="indent">2 We always give thanks to God about you, bringing
(you) to mind in our prayers without end, 3 remembering your work of
faith, (your) labor of (unconditional) love, and (your) patience of
hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father.</p>
<p class="versetxt" align="right">1 Thessalonians 1:2-3</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our past studies have focused upon the faith of the
community, a devotion that withstood the opposition of the city leaders
and the local synagogue. Paul focused the theme of love in 1
Thessalonians 4:9-12. Finally, he addressed the theme of hope in the
Lord Jesus Christ. But, unlike the general faith of the community, and
the overall instructions to love each other, Paul had a particular
issue that caused controversy in the Thessalonian church: the fate of
deceased Christians.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus will come back soon, Paul taught the
Christians at Thessalonika. He will save the faithful from God's wrath
and bring them to heaven. But, what happened to loved ones who died
before the Second Coming? After all, the claims of early Christian
missionaries were not coming true. The return of the Lord was not as
immanent as first thought. Some Biblical scholars think that this delay
was used against the local Christians by opponents. "Your Lord isn't
returning," the opponents could claim, "so your religion is bankrupt."</p>
<p class="bodytext">How could Paul answer the concerns of the
Thessalonians? Paul used the analogy of sleep for death, implying that
death was not an end, but a transitional state. The Christian dead lay
"asleep" in their tombs, just like Jesus did for three days. This
parallel between the experience of Christ and that of the faithful was
merely a corollary to one of Paul's central themes: a literal
interpretation of the phrase "in Christ." According to Paul, the
neophyte had been joined (in a very real way) to Christ in his death
and resurrection at baptism. From that point on, the life and future of
the Christian was interwoven with that of the Savior. If the Christian
who died with the Lord and rose in his new life passed away before his
return, their death somehow reenacted the experience of the Jesus
before his resurrection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Notice the language in 4:14. God would raise up
those who died in Christ with Christ. In other words, those who
experienced the death and resurrection of the Lord in baptism (those
"in Christ") would be raised up to live with him. The language of
ascension was also present. Just as Christ ascended to the Father, so
would the all the faithful, those alive on the last day and those risen
from the dead. [4:16-17]. Paul seemed to imply this final ascension was
the last act of the end times, not the first, as some Christians
assert. After all, the final result of the Second Coming would be a
full realization of unity between Christ and his faithful. In the end,
what Paul meant by the phrase "in Christ" would become fully present.
[4:17b]</p>
<p class="bodytext">As the liturgical year comes to an end, we focus
our attention to the return of the risen Christ. And to those who have
fallen asleep in the Lord. We who live in Christ, whether alive or
dead, hope in his final appearance. Then, death will not be an end or
even a transitional state. It will be destroyed. But, even more
important, we will be united with the Lord in ways unimaginable.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Reflect on your experiences of death. What
funerals or wakes have you attended? What hope did they inspire in the
resurrection? If you could plan your own funeral, how could you
encourage hope in the resurrection?</i></p>
