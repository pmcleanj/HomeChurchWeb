<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Quest for Hope

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“Therefore encourage one another with these words.”

<P>Questions:
<BR>The life of faith is not without anxiety. Perhaps that is where many of our questions come from…our anxiety.  And in all times and places, death has provoked any number of questions bearing on faith.  So Paul is being a pastor here, in a very real sense, answering the questions, and perhaps the anxieties, that have reasonably arisen in the minds and hearts of the earliest Christians who expected the imminent return of Jesus, within their own lifetime.  When they witnessed the deaths of believers, faithful folk who were awaiting the Parousia, the “day of the Lord,” they asked Paul for some kind of explanation.  How would all of this work, they asked; what will happen to those who have died? Paul, of course, responds with assurances of what God is doing, of what God is about, in that very moment and in every moment of history.  With the resurrection of Jesus, God has set resurrection into motion, so to speak; God has put into motion a transformation that will not only overcome death but will bring believers into the very presence of God (“and so we will be with the Lord forever”).   We can be assured, too, that just as God is still speaking, God is still acting today, and we are part of that same great transformation.  It’s true that the answers to the questions of these early Christians might be very different from their own understanding of God’s timeline, but the heart of Paul’s argument is true.  These events, this process, happens on God’s time, not ours.  And those who have died will not be left out.  As for the living, in Paul’s time and today, the instruction is clear to encourage one another, to live in hope, and even in grief to trust that the story is far from over, that they and we are swept up in the great transformation, the resurrection work of God.  John Dominic Crossan sees this transformative process as absolutely basic to the theology of Paul: “Transformation is a process arching from past, through present, into future consummation” (with Jonathan L. Reed, In Search of Paul, HarperCollins).  According to Crossan, “To claim that God has already begun to transform this earth into a place of divine justice and peace demands that you can show something of that transformative activity here and now.  To which Paul would have replied unabashedly: To see God’s transformation in process, come and see how we live.”  How does this understanding of Paul’s eschatological language differ from that of the popular end-of-world novels and movies today?  What sort of hope and fear do such popularized accounts engender?  What sort of response do you think their authors hope to provoke?  Does an “end of the world” scenario produce fear in your heart, or in the hearts of your congregation?  What sort of feelings do they share in common with these earliest Christians, and what sort of expectations?  In what ways do you see God “transform[ing] this earth into a place of divine justice and peace”?  How does the life of your congregation and of the United Church of Christ “show something of that transformative activity here and now,” in the way that you live?  Would outsiders see hope in the life of your congregation?  In what ways?  How much does the hope of the members of your congregation rest in the anticipation of being with the Lord forever, as Paul says, not just in being able to enjoy an afterlife?  How much is God at the center of our hope?

<!-- BEGIN OT READING -->

<P><B>Joshua 24:1-3a, 14-25</B>

<P>Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God. And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors—Terah and his sons Abraham and Nahor—lived beyond the Euphrates and served other gods. Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many. “Now therefore revere the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. Now if you are unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.”

<P>Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods; for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight. He protected us along all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed; and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.”

<P>But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.” And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve the LORD!” Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” He said, “Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.” The people said to Joshua, “The LORD our God we will serve, and him we will obey.” So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.

<P><B>Wisdom of Solomon 6:12-16</B>

<P>Wisdom is radiant and unfading, and she is easily discerned by those who love her, and is found by those who seek her. She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her. One who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty, for she will be found sitting at the gate. To fix one's thought on her is perfect understanding, and one who is vigilant on her account will soon be free from care, because she goes about seeking those worthy of her, and she graciously appears to them in their paths, and meets them in every thought.

<P><I>or</I>

<P><B>Amos 5:18-24</B>

<P>	Alas for you who desire the day of the LORD!
	Why do you want the day of the LORD?
	It is darkness, not light;
	as if someone fled from a lion,
	and was met by a bear;
	or went into the house and rested a hand against the wall,
	and was bitten by a snake.

<P>	Is not the day of the LORD darkness, not light,
	and gloom with no brightness in it?
	I hate, I despise your festivals,
	and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
	Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,

<P>	I will not accept them;
	and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals
	I will not look upon.
	Take away from me the noise of your songs;
	I will not listen to the melody of your harps.
	But let justice roll down like waters,
	and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

<P><I>and</I>

<P><B>Wisdom of Solomon 6:17-20</B>

<P>The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction, and concern for instruction is love of her, and love of her is the keeping of her laws, and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality, and immortality brings one near to God; so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.

<P>Let those be put to shame and 
<BR>confusion who seek my life.
<BR>Let those be turned back and 
<BR>brought to dishonor who
<BR>desire to hurt me.

<P>Let those who say, "Aha, Aha!"

<P><B>1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</B>

<P>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died,so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died. For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died. 

<P>For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel’s call and with the sound of God’s trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.

<P>“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ Then all those bridesmaids£ got up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 

<P>But the wise replied, ‘No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’ And while they went to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. Later the other bridesmaids came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’ Keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

<P>Thirty-second Sunday in Ordinary Time
<BR>November 6, 2005
<BR>1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

<P>Churchwide Celebration Sunday

<P>Two years ago, in focus groups made up of people who are no longer part of a church community, almost no one had even heard of the United Church of Christ, let alone knew what it stands for.  
<P>     But that was two years ago.  Today, the United Church of Christ may not be world-famous, but it’s much better known than ever before because of our TV commercials—an unprecedented and successful effort to reach out in welcome to our communities and to proclaim who we are.. 
<P>    When the Pilgrims set sail for the New World in 1620, their pastor, John Robinson, told them: AThe Lord hath more truth and light yet to break forth from His holy Word.@ Translated for the 21st century, we in the United Church of Christ believe that God is still speaking.
<P>    This is All Saints’ Sunday, and for the second year in a row, many United Church of Christ congregations around the country will be having special gatherings—you might even call them parties!—to celebrate the saints among them who have died during the past year, the babies born during the year, the new members welcomed to the congregation, the visitors received, the Scripture heard and the work done—all to the glory of God.  
<P>    These are also celebrations of joy and gratitude for the United Church of Christ—as so many of our congregations, with each passing Sunday, become spiritual homes for more and more people who believed they’d never find one.  As Ben Guess of United Church News puts it, “the still-speaking God is asking us to offer the sweet word of inclusive love.”  What better reason for celebration!  And for giving thanks to those who came before us, who worked and sacrificed, believed and took action—and  gave us our United Church of Christ.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
