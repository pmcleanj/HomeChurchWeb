the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for late Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Grace
be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Behold,
he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
of him. Even so, Amen.</I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">At one
time, the first and second books of Samuel formed a single book. They
were separated in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures
known as the Septuagint (about 250 BC). 1 Samuel begins with the
story of Samuel: hence the name. 2 Samuel tells the story of David's
rule, first as he gradually gained control of the whole of Judah (the
south), and then when he was king of both Judah and Israel (the
north.) </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
books of Samuel end with six appendices: some stories which fit
earlier chronologically, and some poems. Our reading, &quot;the last
words of David&quot;, is such a poem. An &quot;oracle&quot; is a
prophecy. David's family origins are stated: he is &quot;son of
Jesse&quot;. He is also &quot;anointed by God&quot;. Translations of
v. 1 vary: he is either favoured by Israel's God (&quot;the Strong
One&quot;) or &quot;the favourite of the songs of Israel&quot; or
even (REB) &quot;the singer of Israel's psalms&quot;. God, David
says, speaks to his people through him (v. 2). He has ruled justly,
holding God in awe (&quot;fear&quot;, v. 3). V.4 is paradoxical (how
can it rain when the sky is cloudless and the sun shines?), and
recalls the paradoxes of David's life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">V. 5
recalls Nathan's prophecy to him in 7:11ff: God will make of David a

The covenant God made with David is said to be &quot;everlasting&quot;,
but historically his heirs ceased to rule the land when the
Babylonians invaded in 586 BC. Even so, for the just (the godly)
there is hope of security and prosperity, with God's help. Vv. 6-7
tell of the fate of David's enemies: he will seed a great line, but
the &quot;godless&quot; will be like thorns: they are useless and
will be &quot;thrown away&quot;. The godly should keep their distance
from them, lest the good become corrupted. The fate of the ungodly is
to be &quot;entirely consumed in fire&quot;, to be annihilated.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
Book of Revelation has been problematic since it was written by &quot;John
the Elder&quot; circa 95 A.D., a time when merely being a Christian
was a capital offense. Besides an introduction (1:1-8) and a
conclusion (22:6-21), the book consists of sections that revolve
around the number &quot;7&quot;: seven churches, seven seals, seven
bowls, and seven plagues. The number &quot;7&quot; indicates a
measure of fullness; the author is, after all, describing the
fullness of time at the end of the world. Using these images, the
author warns the seven churches in modern day Turkey (2:1-3:22) and
attempts to paint the &quot;last days&quot; in sequence (4:1-22:9).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Revelations
is a prophetic book in the style of Daniel. As a prophet, the author
might be using symbolic language to describe present troubles (a
Catholic interpretation). Or, he might be predicting future events (a
fundamentalist interpretation). The fight between these two schools
of interpretation only adds to the fiery debate over Revelations.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Found
in the introduction to Revelations, today's passages consist of a
doxology (a glory-giving phrase in 1:5-6) and a prophetic message (to
answer the doxology in 1:7-8). The doxology uses a formula of &quot;to
whom/be the glory/forever.&quot; [6] The doxology praises Jesus
Christ for as lover and liberator [6] since he is the faithful
witness (on the cross) and firstborn of the dead [5]. It also praises
him as the king of kings [5] who made us into a kingdom of priests
[6]. The doxology ends with &quot;Amen.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
prophetic message that answers the doxology consists of a vision [7]
and an affirmation from Jesus [8]. The vision harkens back to Daniel
7:13-14:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">John
combines the image of Daniel's &quot;Son of Man&quot; with one of the
crucified Lord. The people who see Christ will lament because they
will be ruled by the One whose followers they persecuted. This vision
ends with &quot;Amen.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Notice
who answers the vision: the Lord God who expresses his all-powerful
nature in terms of time. Jews were unique in the ancient world, for
they framed creation in terms of linear time, not the cycles of the
seasons. Creation has a beginning, a middle, and an ending, based
upon chronological time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">God's
utterance is an affirmation on the vision and the doxology. The
actions of Jesus Christ and the elevation of believers are all part

to its ending.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Anticipation
threaded through the book of Revelation. But beneath this attitude
lay two outlooks on the world. First, the God of the book was a deity
who exercised his prerogative in historic events. He was not a power
of nature that could be appeased or manipulated. No! This God acted!
He was alive in human history!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Second,
the author dared to see events if they occurred in the very presence
of this God. But, the only way he could witness the events in the
presence of God was in worship.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Revelations
was unique among apocalyptic literature because it fused the
historical and liturgical perspectives in a Christian context. When
John received his revelation, he saw God working in human events
amidst the angelic worship in heaven. In fact, he and the communities
to whom he wrote were part of that angelic praise.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Imagine,
for a moment, the final judgment was in progress. You stood among the
angels in heaven, praising God for all he was doing. How would you
see the events of the end times, as they unfold in real time? The
answer to that question will give you an idea of John&rsquo;s
perspective.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">John&rsquo;s
greeting to the seven churches began with a call to worship. He
invoked the name of God: 1) the Living One active in the past and
coming in the end times, 2) the fulness of the Spirit, and 3) Jesus
Christ. Then, John listed a short resume of Jesus: trustworthy
witness, risen from the dead, and ruler over all earthly powers.
Notice the outline of the Trinity. [1:4-5a]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
invocation had a result. Through his love and his liberating death,
Jesus molded his followers into a priestly nation, a people set apart
to worship the God and Father of the Christ. The end of invocation
was praise, not to the Father, but to Jesus. [1:5b]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
his first invocation, John used a Jewish prayer form that began with
God in heaven, came down to humanity, and returned to God in the
highest. The Our Father with the so-called &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo;
ending is a example of this prayer form. John&rsquo;s invocation was
unique for its end point, however. It began with the triune God but
ended with Jesus.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After
the invocation, John defined THE event of God&rsquo;s activity: the
coming of the Kingdom. He used the traditional imagery and spirit of
Daniel 7. But, notice the reference to John 19:34, the piercing of
Jesus. Everyone would see the coming of the Christ, even those guilty
of his death. And all would mourn at the sight of his glory, from
guilt, from dread of judgment, or both. [1:7]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Finally
in John, the Living One confirmed his activity with a
self-definition. He is the beginning and the end (the horizon of all
that humanity can know or imagine). He repeated this definition with
the same description John used for the Father in 1:4. Notice the two
definitions (&ldquo;Alpha-Omega&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Living One who was
and who will come&rdquo;) mirrored each other in meaning. [1:8]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
the light of these verses, the attitude of anticipation should lace
Christian worship. To praise God is to wait for him to act. We should
look forward to the Lord&rsquo;s coming, in certain knowledge that
God has declared it so. Therefore let us pray and keep our eyes open
for God to act!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">How
do you anticipate the coming of the Lord? How does such anticipation
affect your worship?</FONT></FONT></P>

the last book of the Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of
the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future
and presents an understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle
between good and evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in
symbolic language, its author urges Christians to keep faith in a
period of persecution. It is hard to understand because we do not
know the meaning of the symbols (e.g. animals) it uses. </FONT></FONT>

begins and ends this book as a letter. Literally, it is &quot;to the
seven churches of Asia&quot; (v. 4a), Asia being a Roman province in
western Asia Minor, but &quot;seven&quot; symbolizes totality, so
John may speak to all churches in the province, or to all everywhere.
The salutation combines both Greek (&quot;grace&quot;) and Hebrew
(&quot;peace&quot;) forms, and is from God, here described as being

The salutation is also from &quot;the seven spirits&quot;: this may
mean the Spirit of God (in Isaiah 11:2, it operates in seven ways) or
the seven angels (Michael, Raphael, etc) closest to God (&quot;before
his throne&quot;) in contemporary Jewish thinking. Further, it is
&quot;from Jesus Christ&quot; (v. 5), who is: </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">But
the phrase &quot;King of the Jews&quot; had a spiritual meaning that
might have escaped Pilate. To probe Pilate's understanding, Jesus
answers a question with a question: &quot;Who are your witnesses
about me?&quot; Dismissing Jesus' question, Pilate retorts by
pressing his point: &quot;What have you done?&quot; In other words,
Pilate wants a direct witness from the source Himself, not from his
accusers. [34-35]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Jesus
responds with a speech about his arena (i.e., &quot;his kingdom&quot;).
Jesus' arena is not that of popular culture or politics; if it was
there would be a bloody revolution. [36]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Pilate
still presses the point: &quot;You are a king, aren't you?&quot;
Jesus gives in on a semantic point (&quot;You're the one who says so,
Pilate&quot;) but finally gives Pilate a direct witness: Jesus speaks
the truth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">How
does the truth Jesus speaks and the truth the &quot;world&quot;
speaks different? The truth of the world is transient in nature; it
changes with the season and the political landscape. It speaks to
ambition and power, to possessions and pleasure. The truth of the
world is, at best, shallow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">But
the truth Jesus speaks is one of the heart. The truth of Jesus is
more than facts; it is one of fidelity. God is &quot;true&quot; to
us; that means, he is faithful. He shows us his fidelity through his
Son and the power of his Spirit. When we are true to God in return,
we &quot;live in truth&quot; (that is, in relationship). Since God is
eternally faithful, God's truth goes beyond the transient nature of
politics, fad, and fashion.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">How
does your relationship with God touch you in ways the world cannot
match? How has the truth of world failed you? How has God's
faithfulness sustained you?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A
theologian once said that all revelation is invitation. In other
words, all that God reveals to us invites us to live with him. This
is the reality of Jesus' kingship. Jesus is Lord, so we might live
near him in love. He is King of the World, not over us but for us and
with us.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">John is
the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a
chronological account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels
do, to a degree), but rather &quot;...these things are written so
that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of
God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&quot;
John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">This is
part of John's account of Jesus' trial before Pilate. Pilate has met
with those Jews seeking his death outside his &quot;headquarters&quot;,
the praetorium. He has asked: </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">what
charge, valid in Roman law, do you have to bring against him?</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">(v. 28). V. 29 shows that they
have none to propose. Pilate refuses to get involved by telling them
to try him under Jewish law. They then make it obvious that they seek
Jesus' death.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now
Pilate goes inside the praetorium and asks Jesus: </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">are
you the leader of a revolutionary movement?</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In return, Jesus asks him: </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Is
this question your idea, based on what you have heard, or did others
put you up to it?</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000"> <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Pilate
shows his scorn for Jews; </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">the
religious authorities seek your death, but what grounds are there for
killing you?</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000"> <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
v. 36, Jesus begins to explain the nature of his kingship. Were he a
rebel leader, his followers &quot;would be fighting to keep me from
being handed over&quot; to the religious authorities, but he is no
threat to Pilate's authority. Pilate picks up on Jesus words &quot;my
kingdom&quot;. Jesus is king of &quot;truth&quot; (v. 37); his
subjects are those who belong to the truth. He was &quot;born&quot;
and &quot;came into the world&quot; to establish the kingdom of God,
the ultimate truth.</FONT></FONT></P>

can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
