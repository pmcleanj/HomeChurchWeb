3:14-20</A><BR><B>from

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2>I<FONT COLOR="#800000">n 1:1, Zephaniah
tells us that he is descended from Hezekiah, most likely the king who
ruled Judah 715-687 BCE. This prophet's intimate knowledge of
Jerusalem and affairs in the court, and the absence of a theme found
in other prophetic books - denunciation of the king - suggest that he
was of royal descent. 1:1 also tells us that his ministry began in
the reign of King Josiah, the great reformer. But his denunciation of
corruption in religious affairs suggests that his prophecies date
from before the reforms of 621 BCE. The book predicts doom for Judah
for failing to follow God's ways, and adverse judgememht on other
nations, too; however, the final chapter promises comfort and
consolation for those inhabitants of Jerusalem who wait petiently for
the Lord and serve God as a community. They will rejoice when God
comes into their midst. </FONT></FONT></B>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Earlier in the chapter, the author has
spoken of Jerusalem (her inhabitants) and their crimes: they have
failed to listen to God, accept his advice, trust in him and </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">draw
near</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000"> (v. 2) to him. He has
destroyed other nations as a warning to Jerusalem, but she has
ignored it (vv. 6-7). In spite of this, he will cause Gentiles to
turn to his ways (v. 9); they will serve him by permitting the Jewish
exiles to return to Jerusalem (v. 10). When God does rise (&ldquo;on
that day&rdquo;, v. 11, in an ideal future time), he will bring about
Jerusalem&rsquo;s moral recovery by removing the arrogant from their
midst (v. 12), leaving as &ldquo;the remnant&rdquo; (v. 13), the
&ldquo;humble and lowly&rdquo; (v. 12), who will be godly; they will
live in tranquillity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now the author (or perhaps a later editor)
invites Jerusalem to rejoice because her salvation is about to
happen. God has intervened (v. 15); he dwells with his people; he
protects them. In a military image, God will lead Israel&rsquo;s
army. He will encourage her people (v. 16); he will give them
victory, rejoice in their return to his ways, make his love for them
apparent again, and celebrate in song. As people expected to happen
at the end of time, God will destroy Jerusalem&rsquo;s (and Judah&rsquo;s)
enemies, look after those who suffer, bring the exiles home, and make
the city to be honoured by all (v. 19). They will see Judah&rsquo;s
fortunes restored! (v. 20).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">There is nothing more joyful as forgiveness.
All the great moments in life, birth, sacramental moments, life's
transitions, marriage, and death, have the potential to bring people
together. When people are brought together in forgiveness, there is
relief and peace. These are the cause for joy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Beginning the passage of joy, Zephaniah
symbolizes Jerusalem as a young girl who should be at a party. [14]
Why should there be rejoicing? The danger has passed, the enemies are
gone, and God is in their midst. [15, 17] And not only does the city
have cause for rejoicing; the prophet loudly proclaims God's joy over
the return of his people. [17-18] God and the people are together;
they are reconciled. There is true joy.</FONT></P>

12:2-6</A><BR><B>from

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Isaiah</B> </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">This book can be divided into
two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before
the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult
times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in
723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as
social injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought
valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile
in Babylon. They are filled with a message of trust and confident
hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that
Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, written after the
return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and
despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other
gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that
God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new
home for all peoples. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">This passage is in a similar vein to our
reading from Zephaniah. V. 1 and v. 4 begin &ldquo;... in that day&rdquo;;
11:10 says &ldquo;On that day&rdquo; other nations will note that a
king of David&rsquo;s line (&ldquo;the root of Jesse&rdquo;) sits on
Israel&rsquo;s throne; they will ask about him and the divine glory
that is with him. &ldquo;On that day&rdquo;, says 11:11, God will
gather the remnant, the remaining faithful, from throughout the
world. So the </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">day</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
is the end of the era, when the Messiah will come. &ldquo;You&rdquo;
(12:1) is singular, so perhaps God instructs a herald of events to
come. He will tell the people to give thanks for the end of God&rsquo;s
anger and return to his </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">comfort</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">.
Perhaps metaphorically, &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; in v. 2 and v. 3 is
restoration to the Promised Land: note &ldquo;wells of salvation&rdquo;.
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;strength and ... might&rdquo; (v. 2) will protect
his people. Life-giving water symbolizes God&rsquo;s saving power. In
a second song (vv. 4-6), the people not only give thanks but also
proclaim the good news to all nations: that all may know of him and
his actions. His people are inhabitants of &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; (v. 6),
&ldquo;royal&rdquo; because God, &ldquo;the Holy One of Israel&rdquo;
dwells there.</FONT></P>

4:4-7</A><BR><B>from
<A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comments/cadv3m.shtml">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comments/cadv3m.shtml</A></B></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Paul wrote to the church at
Philippi, a prosperous Roman colony in northern Greece, from prison.
We do not know whether this imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome.
It appears that he was held under house arrest. It is possible that
the epistle is actually made up of three letters. It contains many
personal references, exhorts members of the Philippian church to live
the Christian life and to good ethical conduct, introduces Timothy
and Epaphroditus as his representatives, and warns against legalists
and libertines. Lastly, he thanks the Philippian community for their
material support. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Paul began the conclusion to the letter back
in 3:1a. After a digression &ndash; to warn against heresy and
self-indulgence and to urge devotion to Christ &ndash; he tries to
finish the letter, but certain concerns intrude. It seems that
&ldquo;Euodia&rdquo; (v. 2) and &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo;, two workers
for Christ, differ in their understanding of what the way of Christ
is, and that this is causing disunity in the Philippian community. We
do not know to whom Paul refers as his &ldquo;loyal companion&rdquo;
(v. 3); he is asked to be instrumental in achieving reconciliation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">V. 4 is the conventional Greek salutation
(like our </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">goodbye</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">)
but here Paul means &ldquo;rejoice&rdquo; literally. May you behave
towards others as you should (&ldquo;gentleness&rdquo;, v. 5). Paul
expects the Second Coming soon: &ldquo;The Lord is near.&rdquo; Then
v. 6: rather than worrying on their own, the Philippians should ask
God to help them, through prayer, both in prayers of &ldquo;supplication&rdquo;
(petition) and of &ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo;. God&rsquo;s &ldquo;peace&rdquo;
(v. 7) will protect them against their own failings and external
threats. It &ldquo;surpasses all understanding&rdquo; either by being
beyond the grasp of the human mind or by achieving more than we can
conceive.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">We Christians expect Jesus to come soon. At
this time of year, we expect him at Christmas and at the end of time.
This expectation can be anxious or joy filled. Paul gave us this
choice. The first way leads all sorts of problems, especially in our
relationships with others. The second way leads to peace with others,
for joy is never assertive or destructive. Of course, such joy is a
gift from God. It is based in a peace that transcends the limitation
of the human mind and heart. But if we want to experience God&rsquo;s
peace, we must turn away from anxiety and open ourselves up to his
presence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">So take the time, slow down. Enjoy the
season. Pray in the spirit of thanks for the season. Let God give you
his peace.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><I>How have you slowed down this season? How
have you enjoyed this season?</I></FONT></P>

3:7-18</A></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Luke
is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New
Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who
accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three
sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings (known as Q for
</FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">Quelle</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">)
and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the
poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers.
Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he
wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Luke has told us that &ldquo;... the word of
God came to John ... in the wilderness. He went into all the region
... proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
...&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Now John the Baptist addresses people in
general (&ldquo;crowds&rdquo;, v. 7): he calls them &ldquo;vipers&rdquo;
(poisonous snakes common in Judea), and accuses them of being
baptised with no intention of starting a new, ethical, life. If they
think that by being baptised they will evade God&rsquo;s judgement at
the end of the era (&ldquo;wrath to come&rdquo;, v. 7), they are
wrong: they must also turn to godliness. Being Jewish, having
&ldquo;Abraham as our ancestor&rdquo; (v. 8) is no assurance of
salvation, for anyone who responds to God&rsquo;s gift of love with
appropriate behaviour will be part of the renewed Israel. The people
have a choice (v. 9): either respond to God&rsquo;s offer by
beginning a new way of living, or face condemnation at the end of
time. (Here &ldquo;fire&rdquo; symbolizes adverse judgement.) God
will fulfil his promises to Abraham in unexpected ways! Luke gives us
three examples of behaviour which fit with turning over a new leaf.
The &ldquo;crowds&rdquo; (v. 10) are probably ordinary people; they
should have selfless concern for the disadvantaged. In spite of
attempted reforms, &ldquo;tax collectors&rdquo; (v. 12) still
collected more than prescribed. The &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; (v. 14)
were probably Jews in the service of Herod Antipas; they too were
despised. John tells them that they should follow the emperor&rsquo;s
guidelines on military conduct. That &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo;
is answered here and elsewhere in various ways probably indicates
that simply following rules is inadequate: we must ask again and
again in openness to God&rsquo;s will.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">At the time, people expected the Messiah to
come at any moment (v. 15): perhaps John would restore Israel&rsquo;s
fortunes and God&rsquo;s power would triumph now. John says that the
baptism he offers is vastly inferior to Jesus&rsquo; baptism: for
Jesus, he is so unworthy that he cannot even do a slave&rsquo;s task
(&ldquo;untie ...&rdquo;, v. 16). (In Acts 2:3, fire is associated
with the Holy Spirit.) V. 17 says, in agricultural language, that the
godly (&ldquo;wheat&rdquo;) will be gathered to Christ but the
ungodly (&ldquo;chaff&rdquo;) will be destroyed. John preached </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><I>What causes people to change
their lives? Is it guilt from past indiscretions? Is it hope for a
better future? Or is it both? Explain.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Why do some of the most talented people in
Hollywood or Washington morally self-destruct? What causes those with
no future, no prospects, and no hope to rise above and succeed? One
of the many answers to these questions lies in vision. The ability to
see life and the future in a different way. With vision comes will.
With will comes results. Those who change for the better have vision.
Those who collapse under the weight of their indiscretions lack clear
sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Not only was John the Baptist a contrary
sign to the people. He had vision. He could act as conscience for his
audience. And he could see beyond his time and place to something
greater. Or, more specifically, to SOMEONE greater.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:10-11
&quot;(kept) asking . . . saying&quot; The verbs are literally &quot;were
asking&quot; and &quot;was saying.&quot; The verb tense indicated an
on-going dialogue between John and his audience.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:11
&quot;&quot;Let the (person) having two (under) shirts share (one
undershirt) with one not having (any shirt).&quot; Life in a desert
climate required residents to wear layers of clothing. While an outer
garment and a tunic (&quot;undershirt&quot; in 3:11) would be worn in
the heat of the day, two tunics would be worn in the cold of the
night. John called upon those who possessed (but did not use) an
extra tunic to share with those without any tunic. Hence, John
discouraged hoarding that was not only uncharitable, but also broke
down a sense of community.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:13
&quot;Collect nothing more than (the authorities have) ordered for
you.&quot; is literally &quot;Collect nothing more than from that
having been ordered for you.&quot; Tax collectors actually had a
franchise from the Roman officials. The collectors could garner any
amount from local inhabitants. And they could enforce the taxation
with the threat of imprisonment. Fees collected above the amount the
Romans sought was the net profit for the tax collectors.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:14
&quot;Shake no one down nor accuse (anyone) falsely.&quot; The two
verbs in this command referred to the means by which foreign soldiers
would extort money from a local populace to supplement their incomes.
Roman soldiers were notoriously underpaid. Officials turned a blind
eye to the conduct of their soldiers in these matters. Hence, the
soldiers in John's audience were non-Jewish.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The English slang &quot;shake down&quot; is
as literal a phrase to the Greek as one could get. Both the English
and Greek phrases meant to use violence as a means to extort money
from someone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">If the threat of violence did not work, the
threat of legal proceedings might work. The false word of a soldier
carried more weight with a Roman magistrate than the truth from a
local inhabitant.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Like the other evangelists, Luke used the
ministry of the Baptist to prefigure the ministry of Jesus. The
message of repentance was the same with the two ministries. John's
prediction of the Messiah found its fulfillment in the faith of
Christians.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">There was a third and very subtle parallel
between the two movements. Some people left their homes to see the
Baptist (so, they lived in the desert as if they were homeless).
Others (tax collectors) lived as if there had no home (i.e.,
community ties); so, seeing John was not an inconvenience. A third
group lived a nomadic, outcast existence, by definition (i.e., Roman
soldiers). To each group, John gave practical moral advice to build
up a sense of community. Implicitly, John saw the sincere listener in
his audience as those preparing to become God's new people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Like John's audience, Christians lived a
nomadic, outcast existence. If they did not claim a homeland, like
the Jews, as they looked forward to a new heavenly homeland. In many
cases, neophyte Christians were rejected by family and old friends
who represented ties to a homeland. So, Christians lived on the
spiritual (and, many times, literal) road, like the homeless. After
all, they did call their movement &quot;The Way.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The ministries of John and Jesus gathered
their strength on the fringe, on the road. But, from the outside,
both had a tremendous impact on those with the security of home. For
both ministries turned the sinner into the saint, the derelict into
the moral model, the hardhearted into the compassionate. This change
came about with the very real challenge of living life as if every
daily need depended upon God himself.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:15
&quot;As the people waited with expectation and everyone wondered in
their hearts about John, (if) he himself might not then be the
Messiah,&quot; This phrase referred to John's audience, not the
general populace.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:15-16
&quot;Indeed, I baptize you in water . . . He himself will baptize
you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; John framed his role as a
water baptizer (against the expectations of his audience). But he
compared his role to the Messiah with a prophecy for everyone (&quot;he
will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire&quot;). At this point,
John's message moved from his particular audience to humanity as a
whole. John predicted a universal Messiah, not just a Jewish one.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">&quot;with
the Holy Spirit and fire&quot; What was the connection between the
Holy Spirit and fire? Immersing people in the Holy Spirit would make
them followers. What about fire? If fire were added to the Holy
Spirit, fire would refer to purification (repentance). But the fire
could oppose the Holy Spirit. Then, fire would refer to judgement
(&quot;the fires of hell&quot;). The ambiguity of the phrase can
support either interpretation, but the context with 3:17 supports a
fire of judgement.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3:17
This verse is actually one sentence. The main clause is the judgement
of fire. Clearing the floor and storing the grain is a relative
clause. The context of 3:17 makes both clauses dependent upon 3:16
(the baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire). The violent action of the
winnow shovel is the baptism of the Holy Spirit (i.e., persecution up
to the final judgement). The final test (see Luke 21:36) and
condemnation is the fire of judgement.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">The word
&quot;prophet&quot; connoted two roles: moral conscience and
visionary of future events. In this section of Luke, John did both.
He exhorted his audience to practical, moral change that would
enhance the common good. But, then he pointed to One Greater than he:
the Messiah.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">At the time of John and Jesus, Jews expected
four different types of Messiahs. First, militant Jews looked to a
Davidic king to rise up from the populace and lead a revolt against
the Romans. Second, many Jews expected a great High Priest to cleanse
the Temple from its corruption and restore a pure worship. Third,
some yearned for a Great Teacher like Moses to explain the Law
plainly and led all Jews in the way that would please the Lord. All
three of these Messiahs would come from the people and would have
some sort of pedigree (education, lineage, family or professional
connection). But the last Messiah would appear from nowhere. And his
authority to judge would come from God himself: the &quot;Son of Man&quot;
from Daniel 7:13. The Davidic king would be known for his military
genius. The High Priest would be known for his zealous purity in
worship. The Great Teacher would be known for his wisdom. But the Son
of Man would be known as God's agent of judgement. Clearly, John had
this image in mind when he proclaimed the coming of the One Greater.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">(Christian tradition claimed the other three
images of Messiah for Jesus. Matthew's genealogy emphasized Jesus as
the Son of David, &quot;King,&quot; and Son of Abraham. The five
great discourses found in Matthew point to Jesus as the &quot;Great
Teacher&quot; in the tradition of Moses, who, according to tradition,
wrote the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. And the letter to
the Hebrews spoke to the role of Jesus as &quot;High Priest.&quot;
But the core claim Christians have to the Messiahship of Jesus lay
squarely in the resurrection, an act of God, not of man. The
resurrection justified the identification of Jesus as Daniel's &quot;Son
of Man.&quot; This was the figure John looked forward to.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">John used the image of baptism (immersion)
with the Holy Spirit and fire. The notes above discussed the
relationship between the two. And theological hindsight can reconcile
the differences (i.e., God's mercy and his justice are the same).
Even with that aside, we should remember John's prophecy was violent
in nature, with God himself as the cause. The crisis of God's action
would cause change: personal, social, and world wide. Under the
direction of the Holy Spirit, the believer would suffer from their
faith choice. Those who rejected the faith would also suffer from
God's judgement. And, the Messiah would act as God's agent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Why did all this talk of violence encourage
John's audience? Why were these predictions &quot;Good News?&quot;
Simply because these people would enjoy the comfort of the Spirit, in
spite of the cost. They implicitly realized they would be saved
through God's judgement. (Remember Jesus' words from two weeks ago in
Luke 21:34-36. He encouraged his followers to pray for strength
during the test and for strength to stand before the Son of Man at
the Last Judgement.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Living as a Christian begins and ends with
faith. The ability to see beyond the present. And the ability to
trust the person one sees. John the Baptist empowered people to
believe. To see beyond their moral dilemmas. And to see One Greater.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
