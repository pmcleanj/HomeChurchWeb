<h2>Love Thy Neighbor </h2>
      <p>It seems so deceptively simple: Love God.&nbsp; Love neighbor.&nbsp; How hard is that?&nbsp; I worship God weekly.&nbsp; I say hello to my neighbor if we happen to be  outside at the same time.&nbsp; Even if I use  the word &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; a little more broadly &ndash; I love all classes, races, kinds of  people.&nbsp; I have a generic love for them &hellip;  but &hellip; don&rsquo;t get me started on the guy down the street who allows his dog to run  wild on my property.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you  understand my animosity towards the woman who cut in front of me at the  stoplight.&nbsp; You know that those  politicians who skim money off the top don&rsquo;t deserve any of my sympathy.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;  Not according to Jesus.<br /><br />
  Last year  Christian evangelist Jimmy Swaggart shared a shocking confession in the middle  of a televised sermon. Suddenly Swaggart proclaimed that he would  &quot;kill&quot; a man that looked at him with romantic intent. These are his  exact words: &quot;I've never seen a man in my life I wanted to marry.&nbsp; And I'm gonna be blunt and plain, if one ever  looks at me like that I'm going to kill him and tell God he died.&quot;  (September 12, 2004, television show from New    Orleans, LA)<br /><br />
  Regardless  of your feelings toward homosexuality, I cannot imagine that Jesus would  condone such an action.&nbsp; And I would say  that Swaggart&rsquo;s message is the antithesis of &ldquo;Love God. Love neighbor.&rdquo;<br />
      <h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
<p>Way back in  Leviticus we hear that as people of God we are to love our neighbor as  ourselves.&nbsp; Although the lectionary skips  verses 3-14 I encourage you to read them.&nbsp;  I want to highlight verses 9-10 especially: <em>&ldquo;When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very  edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest.&nbsp; You shall not strip your vineyard bare, or  gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor  and the alien: I am the LORD your God.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />
Although I have never owned a  vineyard, I understand what these verses are saying.&nbsp; To show love for one&rsquo;s neighbor, we are not  to hoard everything for ourselves.&nbsp;  Instead, we are to share what we have been given with those less  fortunate.&nbsp; This shows love.<br /><br />
In the book of  Ruth, Boaz lived these verses when he allowed Ruth, a foreigner, to glean among  the sheaves. (Ruth 2:8-9)&nbsp; Boaz was  familiar with the law requiring a certain amount to be left for those who were  poor.&nbsp; Amazingly, Boaz went beyond what  the law required.&nbsp; He asked his workers  to deliberately leave more than necessary amongst the fields so that Ruth could  gather even more than what the law demanded.&nbsp;  Eventually Ruth and Boaz married and were ancestors of Jesus through  Joseph. (Matthew 1:5)</p>




<p>Sometimes loving  one&rsquo;s neighbor seems to be beyond what we can do (we think Mother Theresa or  Mahatma Ghandi).&nbsp; But heroics are not  called for here.&nbsp; Instead Leviticus calls  for one to live justly in the midst of life.<br />
</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>In  the letter to the Thessalonians Paul reminds the people of Thessalonica that  he, Silvanus and Timothy have come to them in love.&nbsp; Even though Paul, Silvanus and Timothy had a  difficult time in Philippi (2:2), still they  came to Thessalonica.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did they  come?&nbsp; Not to deceive anyone or to trick  anyone (2:3), but because of love.&nbsp; As  Paul writes in verse 7, &ldquo;But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly  caring for her own children.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>This  verse reminds me of a small scene in the recent movie &ldquo;Constant Gardener.&rdquo; In  this scene a woman who has recently lost a baby begins to nurse another woman&rsquo;s  child.&nbsp; The love that this grieving woman  has for this baby can be seen in her anguish when the baby is taken from her  and given back to the baby&rsquo;s biological family.&nbsp;  Paul writes in verse 7 that as much love as a wet nurse might show to a  baby she is nursing, she would love her own children even more.&nbsp; This, Paul writes, is how much love he has  for the people of Thessalonica.</p>
      <p>As  both a former nanny and as a current mother, this verse speaks volumes.&nbsp; As much as I loved the children I nannied  for, how much more do I love my own children.&nbsp;  For Paul, he writes that he loves these people as much as a mother loves  her own children.&nbsp; He is willing to  sacrifice all things to be with them.&nbsp;  Even after hardship, persecution, even facing possible death, Paul comes  &ndash; out of love.&nbsp; How loudly this proclaims  Jesus&rsquo; words, &ldquo;Love God. Love neighbor.&rdquo;        <br />

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>

<p>In  this section of Matthew, after Jesus has entered Jerusalem, Jesus has been having a series of  arguments with the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians.&nbsp; They now come with the question, &ldquo;Teacher,  which commandment in the law is the greatest?&rdquo;&nbsp;  Like any good teacher, Jesus doesn&rsquo;t just make something up out of thin  air.&nbsp; Instead he quotes from two books in  the Hebrew Scriptures &ndash; Leviticus and Deuteronomy: &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God  with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is  the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: 'You shall love  your neighbor as yourself'&quot; (22:37-39).</p>

<p>One  of the stereotypes that we have of a &ldquo;holy person&rdquo; is someone who lives alone  on a mountain top.&nbsp; Personally I think it  would be easier to be a holy person living on top of a mountain or on a desert  island rather than in the midst of a messy and busy life of mother, wife, and  pastor.&nbsp; Think of Thoreau at Walden Pond or the Dhali Lama in Tibet.&nbsp; They have written great works while secluded  from all the cares and worries and &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; of the world.</p>
<p>But this is not what we are called to do and to be.&nbsp; We are called by God to live in the midst of  life &ndash; loving God and loving neighbor.&nbsp;  How do we do this?&nbsp; I must admit,  we do this imperfectly.&nbsp; We love as we  are able, knowing that God&rsquo;s perfect love is only shown through his Son.</p>
<p>The other day when I took my children to school I found myself  losing it in the middle of the parking lot.&nbsp;  After one of my children forgot her posters and we went back home to get  them, we arrived back at the school only to discover my other child had forgotten  his lunch.&nbsp; After driving back home for  the third time and retrieving his lunch, we arrived at the school only to  discover that the release form that was due that day had been left at home.&nbsp; The other parents suddenly saw a  mild-mannered pastor morph into a raving lunatic.</p>
<p>It is in these times that I am thankful for the forgiveness given  through Jesus.&nbsp; I am grateful for the  love shown by a God who gives his Son.&nbsp;  And I pray through gritted teeth, &ldquo;Help me, a poor lost sinner to love  you, O God, and help me love my neighbor!&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Read Leviticus  19:1-18 and the book of Ruth.&nbsp; How do  these passages mirror one another?</li>

  <li>In Leviticus  19:17 it speaks of reproving one&rsquo;s neighbor out of love.&nbsp; Have you had a circumstance in your life when  a reproach said to you or given by you was done out of love?&nbsp; What is the difference between a loving  rebuke and a hateful comment?</li>

  <li>In 1  Thessalonians, Paul makes clear that he and his partners have not come out of  deceit.&nbsp; Why did he have to make this  clear to the Thessalonians?&nbsp; What causes  us to be suspicious of others who claim to &ldquo;love&rdquo; us?&nbsp; When do we have to be careful?&nbsp; When do we need to let our guards down?</li>

  <li>Jesus says that  the greatest commandment in the law is loving God and loving one&rsquo;s neighbor.&nbsp; Name some ways in which we show our love to  God and to our neighbor.</li>

  <li>In Matthew  22:41-46 the Pharisees question Jesus about the Messiah.&nbsp; Why did Jesus&rsquo; answer shut up the  Pharisees?&nbsp; What do these verses have to  do with loving God and loving one&rsquo;s neighbor?</li>
