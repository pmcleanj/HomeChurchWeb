<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<hr>
<strong>Isaiah 2:1-5</strong>
<p>Isaiah wrote these verses about 740 BC, a time when spirits were low
in Judah: Assyrian armies were bent on conquest, and many people
doubted God's power to preserve the dynasty of David in accordance with
his promise; others believed themselves to be invincible in the face of
enemies.</p>
<p>Because Chapter <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>
begins with similar words, it appears that this and the next few
chapters originally formed a separate document. The ideas in vv.2-4 are
also found in Micah <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>. In the future (&#8220;in days to 
come&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+2%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>)
God will launch a new era in which he will dwell on earth (&#8220;house&#8221;), at
Jerusalem. His presence above all others on earth symbolizes his
sovereignty. (Jerusalem began on the eastern hill or &#8220;mountain&#8221;. By
Isaiah&#8217;s time it had expanded on to part of the western hill. &#8220;Zion&#8221;,
v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+2%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>, was originally the name of the 
southern slope of the eastern hill, the site of the first settlement. The name was later used for the whole city.)</p>
<p>The prophet foretells a time when all peoples will make pilgrimage to Jerusalem (&#8220;let us go up&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+2%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>) to worship God &#8211; to learn 
the way of living revealed by God. The city will be the source of &#8220;instruction&#8221; in ethical living. In Chapter 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">30</a>, Isaiah tells us that in his time 
Judah rejected God&#8217;s message, but in this future time all peoples will accept it. (The Hebrew word for &#8220;instruction&#8221; is <em>torah</em> which is also a name for the first five books of the Bible, the Law.) In this future time, God 
will settle disputes among nations (&#8220;judge&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+2%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>)
and between people (&#8220;arbitrate&#8221;). It will be an age of peace and
plenty: warfare being a thing of the past, agriculture (&#8220;plowshares&#8221;,
&#8220;pruning hooks&#8221;) will prosper. (Conquering armies lived off the land
and farmers were needed for military service.) In v.5, Isaiah exhorts
the people to adopt God&#8217;s ways now.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 122</strong>
<p>It seems that the psalmist has been asked to join some people making a pilgrimage to &#8220;the house of the L<small>ORD</small>&#8221;, the Temple in Jerusalem. In v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+122%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a> they have arrived in the city. 
Perhaps &#8220;bound firmly together&#8221; (v.

note &#8220;gates&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+122%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>),

all twelve &#8220;tribes&#8221; (v.

of Israel gather to &#8220;give thanks&#8221; for knowing God and experiencing life
in his ways (&#8220;name&#8221;). It is where kings descended from David reign (as
God&#8217;s representatives), settling arguments (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+122%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>). Vv.

urge all worshippers to pray for the city&#8217;s peace and prosperity. The
psalmist prays to God for its peace (and that of the whole country) on
behalf of those at home (&#8220;my relatives and friends&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+122%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). In v.

<b>Romans</b>
</small><p>
<small>Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

<strong>Romans 13:11-14</strong>
<p>In vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A1-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-8</a>,
Paul has written about the obligations we Christians have to civil
authorities; he has continued his instructions on ethics for
Christians. The only thing we Christians &#8220;owe&#8221; others &#8211; Christians and
non-Christians &#8211; is love: this sums up the obligations of the Christian
in life, of Christian ethics. But as Christians, love is <em>part of the deal</em> rather than an <em>obligation</em>, and can never be completely discharged. Love among Christians is something special: it is mutual.</p>
<p>Then vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A9-10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9-10</a>:
if we love our neighbours, we will treat them as the Ten Commandments
(&#8220;the law&#8221;) requires: this flows naturally out of our love for them,
e.g. we will not offend them by adulterous behaviour, etc. This is why
&#8220;one who loves another ... [fully satisfies] the law&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>).</p>
<p>Now Paul tells us another reason why ethical behaviour is important
for Christians. We know that we are living both in the present and in
the age which is after the first coming of the Messiah and before the
second: &#8220;salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers&#8221;
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>).
Paul expresses it in terms of night and day: we should awake, pass from
darkness to light, from evil to good. The image of armour is also found
in contemporary Jewish writings about the end of the age; in 1
Thessalonians <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Thessalonians+5%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:8</a>, Paul tells us that the 
&#8220;armour of light&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>) is faith, hope, charity, 
fidelity, uprightness, etc. &#8220;Let us live&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>),
he says, as if the Day of the Lord is already here, &#8220;honourably&#8221;, not
in ways that harm ourselves and our neighbours. Rather, let Christ be
our armour, and let us not give in to the temptations of the flesh. (In
baptism, we have already &#8220;put on&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+13%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>, Christ, but life in Christ is 
something that grows with experience. As we grow in the faith, we are more and more able to resist sinful opportunities.)</p>

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

<strong>Matthew 24:36-44</strong>
<p>Speaking to his followers, Jesus has foretold the destruction of the
Temple; he has told them the signs of the coming of the end times (in
terms used in contemporary literature.) In the suffering and trials
which will precede the End, society will break down, &#8220;many will fall
away&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>, from the faith) but 
&#8220;one who endures to the end will be saved&#8221; (v.

&#8220;Son of Man&#8221; (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>,

will come &#8220;with power and great glory&#8221;. This will mark the beginning of
a new era, a new way of being. Followers should discern signs of the
second coming of Christ (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A32-35" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">32-35</a>).</p>
<p>But (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A36" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">36</a>),
we do not know precisely when that coming will be, and neither does
Jesus. The situation will be like that before the Flood: people were
preoccupied with earthly matters (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>).
When the Flood came, a small number &#8220;entered the ark&#8221; and were saved,
but many drowned. The dawn of the new era will also be like this; Jesus
gives two examples: of men (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A40" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">40</a>) and of women (v.

&#8220;taken&#8221; to be with Christ (because they are prepared) but others will be &#8220;left&#8221;. V. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A43" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">43</a> is an other example. 
&#8220;Keep awake&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+24%3A42" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">42</a>) 
to the will of God: be ready for Christ&#8217;s second coming!</p>
