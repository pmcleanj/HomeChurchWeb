<H4 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Avoiding
Scandal</FONT></FONT></H4>
<P>Sometimes, people prefer principle over the good of the community.
This, of course, leads to scandal.</P>
<P>In his first missionary journey, Paul began to preach in the
synagogues, only to find near violent resistance. But Paul also
preached to the non-Jewish Greeks, who converted in great numbers.
The growing influx of Gentiles into the community raised a problem of
Christian self-identity. Because the Savior was Jewish, shouldn't the
converts also be Jewish? Because the community was originally Jewish,
should the converts share the same cultural values as those already
in the community? [1] To these questions, Paul said &quot;No&quot;;
faith in Christ is the only thing necessary for salvation. Paul's
answer, of course, meant that the cultural &quot;pollution&quot; of
the Gentiles would invade what was then a Jewish sect. This caused
great controversy.</P>
<P>Why did Paul so readily preach to the Gentiles? In the act of
preaching the gospel, Paul truly believed he was an instrument of
Messianic prophecy. Paul was the apostle who would make Christ known
as the &quot;light to the Gentiles&quot; (Isaiah 42:6). Now Paul and
Barnabas went to Jerusalem in order to defend their beliefs. [2]</P>
<P>After discussion (which Luke portrayed as reasoned in 15:3-21),
James, leader of the Jerusalem church, sent the letter found in
15:23-29. The letter introduced an official delegation to clarify the
issues [23] and backed the Gentile ministry of Paul and Barnabas
[25-26].</P>
<P>There were four regulations in the letter [29], each meant to keep
the Jewish-Christians from being scandalized. Gentile Christians were
to avoid the following situations. First, eating meat offered to
idols was a communion meal with the deity (even if the meat was
distributed free), so eating this meat would be seen as an act of
idolatry. Second, as a symbol of life, blood was sacred to Jews; the
covenant God made with Noah and his descendants (that is, all
humanity) expressly forbade eating blood (Genesis 9:3-6). Third,
strangling animals was seen by Jews as a cruel death and an insult to
God's creation; eating animals who died in this way would share in
this cruelty. Finally, unlawful marriage would include incestuous
marriages or polygamy. In each case, the Gentile Christian who kept
these regulations would be acting as a &quot;righteous Gentile,&quot;
a non-Jew who worshiped the Jewish God and honored his people.</P>
<P>Paul and his opponents stood on principle. James addressed the
need for peace in the community. What do we require of fellow
Christians, principle or peace? Are we willing to accept the scandal
that comes from principle?</P>

it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
