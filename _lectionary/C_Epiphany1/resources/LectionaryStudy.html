season of joy and light is a most welcome splendor for me this year
as my fianc&eacute; and I find ourselves in the giddiness of being
less than 8 weeks away from our wedding day. In the planning and
preparation we are of course undoubtedly behind, but I have every
confidence that arrangements are being made and that the details will
fall into place as they should. In only one area do I still feel
couched in indecision. It is a detail which seems like it should be
so simple and yet I have found it to be infinitely complex. The final
arrangement for our wedding day that I have yet to decide on, is what
name I am going to take at the end of the service. In this one
matter, I am still waiting for an Epiphany.<BR><BR>In this modern day
and age, women and men are faced with a battery of choices about what
name to take commence their commitment ceremony. One partner may give
up their name and take the other&rsquo;s. Or both may choose to keep
their own name. They can combine their names, hyphenate them, or
select an entirely new name altogether. Do not get me wrong. I
believe it is a wonderful thing that couples have so many different
choices to express their love and life together in the way that is
most appropriate for their relationship. I am simply mesmerized at
what a difficult choice it is to make in choosing a name.<BR><BR>Choosing
a name is not simply about what will make the most attractive
signature, or invite the least taunting from the other kids on the
playground. A name is finally about identity. And how do I choose a
name for my married life that represents that I have not ceased to be
the person I have always been, and yet at the same time I am now
something more than I used to be. I am now part of a whole. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
lesson from Isaiah is what is known as an Oracle of Salvation.
According to Professor Ralph Klein, these oracles originated as a
liturgical response to lament psalms, signifying God&rsquo;s answer
to their prayers. In this most tender oracle, Israel, God&rsquo;s
Beloved, is the recipient of an intimate tender affection similar to
that bestowed on Jesus in his baptism. Israel is not to fear, for God
has called them by name. Their identity is wrapped up in God. They
are God&rsquo;s people and they will not be harmed. Not even
dangerous threats like fire and water will consume them, for God is
their Savior. Centuries later as Christian history begins to unfold,
these treacherous elements will be transformed into symbols of
redemption through baptism in Christ. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">This
book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1
to 39 were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700
BC. These were difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a
disastrous war was fought with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel,
the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the
cause of these events as social injustice, which he condemned, and
against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written
during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled with a message
of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some
scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the
book, written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters
speak of hope and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for
worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks
of the hope that God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory
and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Judah has
complained that God has deserted them, his people, in the destruction
of Jerusalem and in their exile. God has told them, &ldquo;my
servant&rdquo; (42:19), that they are &ldquo;blind&rdquo; and &ldquo;deaf&rdquo;
to his will and his way. They see but do not observe; their &ldquo;ears
are open&rdquo; (42:20) but they do not hear. They are a devastated
people, a &ldquo;prey with no one to rescue [them]&rdquo; (42:22) God
asks, through the prophet, &ldquo;Who among you ... will attend and
listen for the time to come?&rdquo; (42:23).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Now God tells
them (&ldquo;Jacob&rdquo;, 43:1), whom he has created, not to fear
for the future: he has and will rescue, save, them. In all times, the
Israelites are his, his people (&ldquo;called you by name&rdquo;).
Even when in grave danger (&ldquo;waters ... rivers ... fire&rdquo;,
v. 2), &ldquo;I will be with you&rdquo;. (Thunderstorms were
considered evil, and the &ldquo;waters&rdquo;, the seas, to be
inhabited by demonic monsters.) Because the Israelites are so
&ldquo;precious in my sight&rdquo; (v. 4), God will &ldquo;exchange&rdquo;
them for other nations: Israel will be freed (at least spiritually)
while Egypt, Ethiopia and Seba (in Yemen) will become Persian vassal
states. Vv. 5-6 prophesy that Jews, God&rsquo;s people, will gather
from the whole known world. So completely will God&rsquo;s children
share divine life that they will be addressed by God&rsquo;s name
(&ldquo;called by my name&rdquo;, v. 7). When God&rsquo;s people
observe and listen, they will contribute to his &ldquo;glory&rdquo;.
While here God calls his family &ldquo;sons&rdquo; (v. 6) and
&ldquo;daughters&rdquo; (those to whom he imparts life), it is only
after Jesus comes that we are told to respond with &ldquo;Abba&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Father&rdquo; (Luke 11:2 and Romans 8:15).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Seeing Beyond Our
Limitations</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>According to many
modern biblical scholars, the book of Isaiah is actually the work of
three different authors writing at three different times. Chapters
1-39 can be attributed to the original Isaiah who preached between
740 and 687 B.C. During the rise of the Assyrian empire. Chapters
40-60 can be attributed to the so-called &ldquo;Second Isaiah.&rdquo;
Second Isaiah wrote 150 years later (537 B.C.) with the anticipated
return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. The remainder of the book
(chapters 61-66) was written by the so-called &ldquo;Third Isaiah.&rdquo;
Third Isaiah wrote about 25-50 years after the return and addressed
the need of the people to maintain hope. The present passage comes
from Second Isaiah.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In this passage,
Second Isaiah introduced the &ldquo;Suffering Servant,&rdquo; the
person who would lead the people like King David. Notice the servant
was chosen by God; he was given God&rsquo;s Spirit, so he would bring
justice to everyone, Jew and foreigner alike. [1]. For the society of
the time, the servant would be counter-cultural; he would not be
interested in fame or power. But his rule would be gentle but would
be sure. [2-3] His rule would precede his teaching to the coast
lands, areas west (the Mediterranean world) and south (along the Red
Sea). [4]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In verses 6-7,
God commissioned the servant. God called the servant to justice and
to act as God&rsquo;s representative (as a covenant for the people
and a light to the nations). [6] How was he to be just and a symbol?
He would give the blind sight and the prisoner freedom. [7] These
images of sight and liberation could be taken literally or
figuratively. At the time of Second Isaiah, the ruling elite of Judea
were captives held by the blind ambition of foreign dictators. In a
figurative sense, the blindness and imprisonment could be the
people&rsquo;s lack of faith. In either case, the servant would be
God&rsquo;s instrument of wholeness and liberation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As the year
begins, we could use sight to see beyond our limitations and freedom
from our self-imposed faults. Let us pray for this time of renewal,
the gift of Jesus that the Father so willing give us.</FONT></FONT></P>

relationship with God help you see beyond your world? How does God
help you see the possibilities? How does faith in Christ help lift
you, to change you?</I></FONT></FONT></P>

is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950
BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types:
hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and
wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;

short lesson from Acts reminds us that we are not only given a new
identity in baptism, but we are given something much more. We are
given the gift of the Holy Spirit. For some reason, in this story,
the Spirit does not come until some time after the baptism has
occurred. In other cases, the Spirit is received before baptism. As
William Loeder points out, though the time and sequence sometimes
varied, for early Christians, coming to faith, being baptized, and
receiving the Holy Spirit, were all seen as different aspects of one
total event. These are the aspects that unite us in our identity as
the Children of God. In baptism, we do not cease to be the individual
that God created us to be, but we are something more than we used to
be. We are now part of a whole. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">This
book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with
Jesus' ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the
church. By no means a comprehensive history, it does however describe
the spread of the church from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as
far as Greece. The episodes he reports show how Christianity arose
out of Judaism. He shows us something of the struggles the church
underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy Spirit guides
and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the Roman
Empire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Philip was one of
the seven chosen by the Church to ensure that widows received basic
rations: see 6:1-6. When persecution has started in Jerusalem, he has
travelled to Samaria to preach the good news there: the first known
evangelism outside Jewish areas. The crowds there &ldquo;listened
eagerly&rdquo; (v. 6) to what Philip told them, &ldquo;hearing and
seeing the signs that he did&rdquo;. Even Simon the well-known
magician told them that Philip spoke and acted through God&rsquo;s
power. Those who believed, including Simon, were baptised (vv.
12-13).</FONT></FONT></P>

send Peter and John to Samaria. Usually in Acts, converts receive the
Holy Spirit at baptism (see 2:38 and 19:5-6) or before it (see

only when the two apostles, representatives of the mother church,

&ldquo;God is not a receiver of faces&rdquo; In royal courts, the
king would receive the presence (i.e., the &ldquo;faces&rdquo;) of
those in his court. &ldquo;Facing the king&rdquo; was a sign of
respect. And a sign of one seeking favor. Luke meant this second
meaning. God was not like a king who received the &ldquo;face&rdquo;
of those he favored. In other words, God was impartial.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>10:36-38 This
unwieldy sentence can be divided into two sections: the spread of the
Good News (10:36-37) and its content (10:38). In his speech, Peter
assumed his audience already knew the &ldquo;word&rdquo; (i.e.,
&ldquo;logos&rdquo; in Greek; &ldquo;message&rdquo; in this context)
that spread from Galilee to Judea after the ministry of the Baptist.
This message spread by &ldquo;word&rdquo; of mouth (i.e., &ldquo;rayma&rdquo;
in Greek).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The context of
the message (sent off by a colon at the end of 10:37) was simple:
Jesus of Nazareth. He was the one God anointed with the Spirit and
power. He was the one who proved God was with him on his mobile
ministry through his healing. In this context, Peter presented the
healing ministry of Jesus as spiritual warfare with the Devil
himself.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>10:36 &ldquo;the
sons of Israel&rdquo; were the faithful Jews, the true descendants of
Israel.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>10:38 &ldquo;healing
all the (ones) having come under the power of the devil&rdquo; The
translation of the verb &ldquo;having come under that power&rdquo; is
weak. The Greek verb inferred the devil exercised and &ldquo;lorded&rdquo;
power over those under his control. In this context, the concept of
healing meant something more than just exorcism. Sickness and disease
were seen as the acts of control by the Evil One. Healing cast off
the lordship of Satan.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Why does God
accept us? Why does he want us close to him? Simply because he sent
his Son to us!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This short
section from Acts could be divided into three sections: Peter&rsquo;s
reaction to the message of Cornelius, his summary of how the Good
News has spread, his preaching about Jesus.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As a lead up to
the first section, Peter had a vision that questioned kosher diet
rules (10:9-16). About the same time, Cornelius, a Roman centurion
who could be described as a &ldquo;righteous Gentile,&rdquo; received
a message from God that told him his prayers had been answered; he
was to send men for Peter (10:1-8). When the men fetched Peter, he
traveled with them to the house of the soldier. At that point, Peter
and Cornelius compared notes about their visions (10:26-33). Peter
realized that God&rsquo;s salvation was universal. And the centurion
was ready to become a follower of the Messiah.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The second
section merely reported what was already known. Jesus had a
reputation that buzzed throughout Palestine. But what was that
reputation?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The third section
answered the question. And it answered the question of God&rsquo;s
intentions. The answer was simple: Jesus of Nazareth. God &ldquo;anointed&rdquo;
(i.e., chose and empowered) this Jesus with the Spirit (in context,
the Spirit and power are synonymous). He used God&rsquo;s Spirit to
show everyone God was with him. As he traveled in his ministry, Jesus
healed and, in doing so, overturned the realm of evil.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Why did God
accept us? Because he wanted to show us his face in the person of his
Son, Jesus the Christ. When we see God&rsquo;s face in Jesus, we
truly know that he accepts us and loves us. We are his.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Look at the
image of Jesus. What does that image tell you about God and his
intentions? Do you feel love and accepted by God when you look upon
the face of Jesus? Explain.</I></FONT></FONT></P>

popular perception, &ldquo;the words come intimately to the praying
Jesus, not to an audience of eavesdroppers.&rdquo; Rather than a
public proclamation, the announcement represents a genuine private

out this new identity in Christian Community.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Luke
is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New
Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who
accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three
sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings (known as Q for
</FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Quelle</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">)
and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the
poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers.
Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he
wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>People flock to
John the Baptist, responding to his urging to start new, ethical
lives &ndash; as a way of preparing for Jesus (vv. 3-6). John has
condemned those who seek his baptism with no intention of reforming
their ways (v. 7). He has warned that being Jewish is no assurance of
being part of the renewed Israel. Failure to respond to his call to
repentance can lead to condemnation at the end of time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>V. 15a, in the
Revised English Bible, says: &ldquo;The people were all agog,
wondering about John ...&rdquo; People expected a &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;,
an agent of God who would restore Israel and the triumph of God&rsquo;s
power and authority. John tells them that &ldquo;one who is ...
coming&rdquo; (v. 16) is so great that he is unworthy even to &ldquo;untie
... his sandals&rdquo;, a task done by slaves. Baptism purifies,
removes sin. The agents the &ldquo;one&rdquo; will use are vastly
superior to the water John uses. Jesus is also more &ldquo;powerful&rdquo;,
mightier, as leader of the final struggle against evil. (At
Pentecost, the Holy Spirit comes with tongues of fire.) V. 17 uses
the metaphor of harvesting to tell of Christ&rsquo;s action as judge
at the end of time. The wheat was tossed in the air with a &ldquo;winnowing
fork&rdquo;: the grain fell to the ground but the chaff was carried
by the wind to the edge of the &ldquo;threshing floor&rdquo;. God
will &ldquo;gather&rdquo; the godly but will condemn the ungodly (to
burn in hell).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus is baptised
(v. 21) to show his solidarity with John&rsquo;s proclamation of part
of God&rsquo;s plan for saving all who come to him. Jesus begins and
ends (22:46) his ministry with a prayer. In vv. 21c-22, God shows
himself to believers: an event beyond human language. The Holy
Spirit, always with Jesus, is seen descending on Jesus, marking a
milestone in Jesus&rsquo; career. People really see the event (&ldquo;in
bodily form&rdquo;). The Holy Spirit seems &ldquo;like a dove&rdquo;
&ndash; a bird symbolizing the hopes of humans for love, life and
union with God &ndash; hopes now realized in Jesus. The voice calls
on Jesus as God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Son&rdquo; and servant (&ldquo;well
pleased&rdquo;, v. 22). Jesus is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beloved&rdquo;,
the one whom he chooses as his agent.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Has something

importance? What did you do about it?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I don&rsquo;t
know about you. But I can only do one thing at a time. &ldquo;Multitasking&rdquo;
is difficult for me. I stand in awe of people who can do more than
one thing at a time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>When I am
pressured and try to do more than one thing at the moment, I can get
confused. These are the times I am vulnerable. Someone could approach
me with a matter of importance, and I would treat it as trivial. I
must admit I have made too many wrong decisions when important
decisions needed to be made. Simply because I was distracted,
confused.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>If you are like
me, then a time for reflection each day is a must. For, in
reflection, we can see the gravity of events around us. And take
action.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus was no
different. But his reflection came in times of prayer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This gospel can
be divided into two sections: John&rsquo;s rejection of the title
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; and the introduction of the real Messiah. 3:16
&ldquo;whose strap of (his) sandal I am not (worthy) enough to loosen
on him&rdquo; While this clause is clumsy in English, it is elegant
in Greek. The clause begins (&ldquo;whose&rdquo;) and ends (&ldquo;on
him&rdquo; which is actual &ldquo;his&rdquo;) with possessive
pronouns that refer to &ldquo;strap.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He will
baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo; The baptism of fire
could refer to the Final Judgment or to spiritual maturation. In the
first sense, the Holy Spirit and the Final Judgment are opposed to
each other. Christ as the Great Judge would favor his followers with
the Spirit, while condemning those who rejected the Spirit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In the second
sense, the Spirit was the support for the Christian undergoing
persecution (i.e., &ldquo;fire&rdquo;). Those who expected to grow in
the Spirit would encounter opposition, even martyrdom, as a result of
their choice. Spiritual maturity had a cost.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Luke presented
the ministry of the Baptism as a dialogue between himself and his
audience. John preached. His audience took his message to heart. At
the core of John&rsquo;s message was preparation for the Christ.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As the people&rsquo;s
expectations for the Messiah rose, John defined his own status. He
was the prophet, not the Messiah. He was not worthy of the Coming
One. Just as Mark wrote, Luke recorded the Holy Spirit and fire
prediction of John. As the note above stated, there has been some
discussion about the relationship between the Holy Spirit and fire.
Personally, I think they are the same, God&rsquo;s love and justice.
[15-16]3:21b-22 Unlike Matthew and Mark, Luke envisioned the
revelation of the Trinity (descent of the Spirit and the voice from
heaven) while Jesus was at prayer, not as he emerged from the water.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Unlike the
accounts found in Mark and Matthew, Luke simply recorded the fact
that Jesus had been baptized (past tense). The revelation of the
Trinity occurs during Jesus&rsquo; prayer, not as he rose out of the
water. [21] This reflected Luke&rsquo;s emphasis not on historical
event, but upon the revelation of it importance. For Luke, it was not
when an event &ldquo;happens to me&rdquo;; it is the moment I &ldquo;get
it,&rdquo; I make the connection. For Luke, prayer was <I>the time</I>
of revelation and insight; Luke portrayed Jesus in prayer before the
major decisions of his ministry.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>For Luke, prayer
was the time for grace, God with us. This could not be
underestimated. Luke used the images of a actual dove and a actual
voice to communicate the concrete reality of God&rsquo;s grace with
us. The heavens were torn open, so there was no barrier between God
and his people. [21-22] Grace was now present; the time of
realization was in prayer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>When do you
realize times of grace? How has your prayer time given you those
&ldquo;graced&rdquo; moments?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Luke recorded the
message of John and the baptism of Jesus along the lines of Mark and
Matthew. But he changed one small detail. The moment of realization
was in prayer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Prayer is a time
for gentle insight and peace. It is not earth shattering, but it can
be earth moving. God can rule with justice, insight, and liberation,
but we must take the time to realize his gifts in prayer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We cannot
multitask prayer and expect results.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>This week,
plan for prayer time as a time for reflection. Slow down and
concentrate on your words to God. And your presence with God. See how
God will bless your time with him.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
