<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Isaiah</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This book can be divided into two (and possibly
three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before the exile, from
about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult times for the
southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought with Syria; the
Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and
threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly.
Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon.
They are filled with a message of trust and confident hope that God
will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to
66 form a third part of the book, written after the return to the
Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and despair; they berate
the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second
Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Isaiah 6:1-8,(9-13)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>In this passage, Isaiah gives the grounds for his authority as a
prophet. The &ldquo;year&rdquo; is 742 BC. Assyria is expanding its
borders. (&ldquo;Uzziah&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Azariah&rdquo; in 2
Kings 14:21.) The northern kingdom, Israel, is trying to coerce Judah
into a military alliance against the Assyrian threat.</P>
<P>Isaiah has a vision of God enthroned, surrounded by courtiers,
with &ldquo;seraphs&rdquo; (v. 2, griffin-like creatures), hovering
above him, guarding him. One pair of wings cover &ldquo;their faces&rdquo;
in the awesome presence of God, and a second cover their genitals
(&ldquo;feet&rdquo; is a euphemism) as a sign of commitment to
purity; the third is used to fulfil commissions from God. &ldquo;Holy&rdquo;
(v. 3), repeated three times for emphasis, identifies God as
<EM>all-holy</EM>, sinless, apart from earthly things. God is &ldquo;Lord
of hosts&rdquo;, the warrior for Israel; he rules over &ldquo;the
whole earth&rdquo;, all peoples. The setting appears to be the
Temple, so the &ldquo;pivots&rdquo; (v. 4), which shake due to an
earth tremor (a sign of God&rsquo;s presence), are those on which the
heavy Temple gates turned. &ldquo;Smoke&rdquo; is also a sign of
divine presence, as is the cloud of glory in the desert (Exodus
40:34).</P>
<P>Isaiah feels totally inadequate in God&rsquo;s presence: he feels
&ldquo;unclean&rdquo; (v. 5), unfit to stand before God, yet he sees
God. He also sees the &ldquo;people&rdquo; (either Judah or his
disciples) as unworthy, but a &ldquo;seraph&rdquo; (v. 7), an agent
of God, purifies him, rendering him fit and qualified to speak God&rsquo;s
word to his people. God confers with his advisors: &ldquo;Whom shall
I send?&rdquo; (v. 8), and Isaiah volunteers to be prophet to Judah.
In vv. 9-13, God accepts his offer, and tells him that most people
will reject God&rsquo;s message (they will not <EM>hear</EM> it and
will fail to understand it), preferring traditional (corrupt) ways.
But a small number (&ldquo;its stump&rdquo;, v. 13) will accept it.
Most will be destroyed; even the remnant will endure difficult times.
Within nine years, Assyria had invaded and made Judah a puppet state.</P>

</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>My
earliest childhood memory goes back to age four. It was an ordinary
day, and I passed it in an ordinary way like a child might, playing
games with my sister. It started out as an innocent game of Hide and
Seek. It was a game we played often and a game I always lost, since
my sister was older than I and much better at uncovering good hiding
places. Today I decided to take extra care and time to choose my
hiding place and I found the perfect undetectable cove by burying
myself underneath a blanket in my crib. <BR><BR>The memory is still
vivid to me. I remember the sounds of the creaky crib as I crawled
into it and the odor of baby powder that filled the room. And I can
still see my distinct viewpoint as I peered underneath the corner of
the blanket through the cradle bars to watch if my sister would
discover me.<BR><BR>The sound of muttered numbers counting down could
be heard from the other room until finally the announcement was
proclaimed ?READY OR NOT HEAR I COME!? And the hunt began. A minute
went by and I did not see her approaching. Another minute passed as
she searched the other rooms of the house. The footsteps began to get
louder and louder until I knew she was about to enter my room. I held
my breath and watched as she checked in the closet, and under the
bed, and in the toy box. But she never checked the crib! <BR><BR>Eventually
she announced her words of defeat, ?O.k. I give up. You can come out
now.? I had done it! I outfoxed my wiser older sister! This was a
moment of true victory, so rather than come out right away and reveal
my ingenious hiding place, I took a minute to revel in my glory and
continued to lie there as I watched my sister?s frustrations
mounting. ?I said you can come out now! Come out! Cindy?!? <BR><BR>As
she walked through the house calling my name for me to come out, her
voice continued to grow with new emotion ? from frustration to anger
to even fear. Still, I did not come out. I was playing my own game
now and I was winning! Finally, the calling stopped and the house was
silent for a few minutes.<BR><BR>The sound of heavy footsteps coming
from the garage shattered the silence, and also shattered my victory.
A new voice called my name, and this time it was that of my father.
He was not messing around and he threatened to call the police if I
didn?t come out right away. I heard the fear in my own father?s voice
of not knowing where his child was. I wanted to run to him and show
him that I was o.k. but I was afraid to come out because I knew I had
done something wrong and I was ashamed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Isaiah?s
experience of his prophetic call by God is not unlike this childhood
memory. His memory, too, is very vivid. He recalls the encounter in
the first person, and it is full of descriptive imagery and
psychological insights. Isaiah is in awe standing before the glory of
the Lord and he too is afraid, for he is unclean and not worthy to
stand before the Lord. For how can a sinner stand before God?<BR><BR>When
my father called my name I did not come to him at first because I was
afraid he would punish me for doing something wrong. When I finally
did come to him, it was not my courage and composure that made me
worthy of standing before him, for I had neither of these things.
Rather, it was his forgiving embrace that wiped away my sin and made
us right again. <BR><BR>For Isaiah, it is the cleansing act by the
angel that blots out his sin and makes him worthy of answering God?s
call. A new man, changed by forgiveness, Isaiah is able to answer,
?Here I am, Lord; send me!&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H4>The Call of Isaiah</H4>
<P>Last week we investigated Jeremiah's prophetic call; today, we
study Isaiah's call. Isaiah lived 150 years before Jeremiah. He was
born into an aristocratic family who advised the King. He prophesied
during the Assyrian advance on Jerusalem in 705 B.C. Indeed, much of
his life as a court prophet (advisor to the king) was spent trying to
keep Judah independent from Assyria to the north and Egypt to the
south.</P>
<P>Unlike any other prophet, Isaiah receives his prophetic call in a
vision during Temple worship. Jews believed that God &quot;dwelled&quot;
on earth (i.e., the place they knew God was present) in the Temple.
They also believed that the Temple itself was a mirrored image of
God's heavenly court. In Isaiah's vision, the Temple does indeed
become God's Holy court.</P>
<P>As an observer, Isaiah does not see God directly, only the train
of his garment (i.e, his glory). [1] Seraphim have six wings: two to
hover with, two to cover their faces (so they would not see God's
glory and die), and two to cover their feet (i.e, their genital area
for modestly sake). The angels cry out their worship; their words
have been incorporated into our &quot;Hosanna&quot; at Mass. In
response to their words, the doors shook (an earthquake?) and smoke
filled the Temple; for the people of the time, an earthquake and
smoke were both signs of divine presence. [2-5]</P>
<P>In the presence of God, Isaiah was anxious for his life because,
in the face of such divine power, he could die. He was one of a
sinful people who spoke with &quot;unclean lips&quot; (i.e., those
who said one thing and did another). But his &quot;sin&quot; is
removed by the touch of a burning coal to his lips; now Isaiah would
only speak the truth and be single hearted. With this sin removed he
could speak in the holy court. [6-7]</P>
<P>God calls out for a prophet. Here, Isaiah's anxiousness turns to
willingness. The &quot;clean&quot; Isaiah becomes God's prophet. [8]</P>
<P>Isaiah was a witness to God's power, first as an observer, then as
a prophet. We are called to be God's witnesses, by what we see in our
world and by what we do in our world. Seeing God's power requires
prayer; doing God's will requires honesty and purpose.</P>
<P><I>How has God called you to be his witness? His prophet?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 138</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The psalmist expresses his gratitude for God&rsquo;s steadfast,
enduring love and his care for his faithful followers, for whom he
will fulfill his purpose (v. 9). Vv. 1-2 picture the psalmist in the
courtyard of the Temple (&ldquo;toward&rdquo;, v. 2) to offer thanks.
For v. 2b, the Revised English Bible has: &ldquo;for you have exalted
your promises above the heavens&rdquo;. V. 3 tells of the psalmist&rsquo;s
experience: when he called upon God, he not only answered but &ldquo;made
me bold and strong&rdquo; (REB). Vv. 4-6 are a hymn of praise. The
REB begins vv. 4 and 5 with &ldquo;Let&rdquo;: may &ldquo;all the
kings&rdquo; praise God when they hear his words; may they sing of
God&rsquo;s ways, because (v. 6), exalted as he is, he cares for &ldquo;the
lowly&rdquo; but takes note of the errors of the unjustly proud
(&ldquo;haughty&rdquo;). Vv. 7-8 are an expression of faith, of trust
and acknowledgement. In spite of his troubles, God preserves the
psalmist, exercising divine power against his foes. (God&rsquo;s
power is his &ldquo;right hand&rdquo;, v. 7.)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1 Corinthians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the
land route from the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An
industrial and ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the
arts. Its inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul
answers two letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and
internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded.
Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57
AD. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>1 Corinthians 15:1-11</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul has heard that some at Corinth deny the physical resurrection
of the body, claiming that only the spirit matters. Now he argues
against this view. He says: I draw your attention to the &ldquo;good
news&rdquo; that I proclaimed to you, which you &ldquo;received&rdquo;
(v. 1), &ldquo;in which ... you stand&rdquo; and &ldquo;through which
... you are being saved&rdquo; (v. 2) &ndash; assuming that &ldquo;you&rdquo;
embrace this &ldquo;message&rdquo; (and are doing it). I ask you to
note the <EM>form of the words</EM> I used &ndash; unless (in not
accepting the message fully) &ldquo;you have come to believe&rdquo;
to no purpose. The most important tenets I handed on to you are:
&ldquo;Christ died for our sins&rdquo; (v. 3), &ldquo;he was buried&rdquo;
(v. 4, he really died), &ldquo;was raised ...&rdquo; and appeared to
various persons and groups. His death, burial and rising again were
&ldquo;in accordance with the scriptures&rdquo;, part of God&rsquo;s
plan. (Only the appearances to Peter, &ldquo;Cephas&rdquo;, v. 5, and
to the &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; are in the Bible.) I, Paul says, was the
last to see him: I, a <EM>monster</EM> (in appearance or as
persecutor of the Church), the &ldquo;least of the apostles&rdquo;
(v. 9). I, through &ldquo;the grace of God&rdquo; (v. 10), have
achieved more than any other apostle. We all (&ldquo;I or they&rdquo;,
v. 11) proclaim the same good news; this is how &ldquo;you have come
to believe&rdquo;.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
second lesson tries to drive home once again that it is not out of
our own worthiness that we are able to answer God?s call in our
lives, but by the grace of God alone. For as Paul describes his own
call experience, he reminds us that he was no saintly follower of
Christ to begin with. Indeed, he had started off by persecuting other
Christians. Rather than basing his success in spreading the gospel on
his own credentials, he calls himself the ?least of the apostles,
[even] unfit to be called an apostle.? It is the grace of God that
has made him what he is, and God?s grace is not wasted in vain. So
too, when God calls us, even if we feel we are unworthy, we can
expect that God?s grace will not be wasted in vain. Through us God
can do amazing and wonderful things. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H4>The Power of the Good News</H4>
<P>15:1 &ldquo;Good News&rdquo; is &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo; in Greek.
So, the next phrase &ldquo;that I evangelized among you&rdquo; is
redundant; the verb &ldquo;evangelize&rdquo; the verb form of the
noun &ldquo;evangelion.&rdquo; Paul used this language for emphasis.</P>
<P>15:1-2 This sentence focused on Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo;
(i.e., Good News). After the main clause, he built an &ldquo;A-B-A&rdquo;
structure. His preaching of the Good News (&ldquo;evangelized&rdquo;)
forms the &ldquo;A&rdquo; that highlighted the origin of the
community (&ldquo;(that) which you received&rdquo;), it reason for
being (&ldquo;in which having stood&rdquo;), and its direction
(&ldquo;through which you are being saved&rdquo;). In other words,
the Good News Paul preached resulted in the establishment of the
community at Corinth and the salvation of that community. If the
members deviated from that Good News, their faith was in vain.</P>
<P>15:3b-8 Did Paul argue out of a strict time frame? Or did he
rearrange the time frame for his argument? Clearly, 15:3b-5 was the
correct time sequence: Jesus died, rose, and was seen by Peter
(Kephas in Aramaic) and the Twelve. But, the rest of the sequence
could be questioned. Was Paul really the last to see the Risen Lord?
Or, did he use the end position to argue that he was &ldquo;least of
the apostles?&rdquo; While a definitive answer was not possible, Paul
did argue the &ldquo;last is first&rdquo; in 15:10; he worked harder
than any other apostle.</P>
<P>15:8 &ldquo;as a premature birth&rdquo; implied a near
miscarriage. The result of Jesus&rsquo; appearance to Paul was a
weak, sickly, almost near-death reaction. Paul did not immediately
change into the bold preacher of the Good News that the Pentecost
experience implied. Instead, he was cut down in stature, from that of
a proud man to that of babe, a person whose raison d&rsquo;etre had
just been taken away from him. (See Acts 9:1-19)</P>
<P>What saps the Church of it energy? More than heresy, backbiting,
gossip, and judging others misdirects and ultimately corrupts the
community. These vices have been the implied themes Paul railed
against in First Corinthians. Over and over, he tried to refocus the
sights of the Corinthians on the Good News and its implications for
life (i.e., the greater spiritual gift of wisdom and the theological
virtues of faith, hope, and charity). In this passage, he again set
his sights on the Good News itself.</P>
<P>Paul clearly believed the &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo; itself had
power. For it was an encounter with Christ. The &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo;
was the reason the community began. When Paul preached the Good News,
people responded in faith. The &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo; was the
reason the community existed. The faithful &ldquo;stood firm&rdquo;
in the faith. And the &ldquo;evangelion&rdquo; was the instrument of
salvation. Through the Good News, the faithful met Christ, hence they
were being saved. This last phrase needs to be emphasized. Salvation
was dynamic, ever present, AS LONG AS CHRIST WAS PRESENT. Hence the
preaching of the Good News and its constant reception by the faithful
(forever offer and acceptance), were instruments of Christ acting in
the world. Through preaching and faith, people realize Christ is
present. So, they can always say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the gift God
offers them.</P>
<P>Since the Reformation, there has been a split over the
instrumentality of salvation through the word preached. Some connect
the preacher as the instrument. Others focus upon the Good News
proclaimed. Clearly, in 15:1-2, the latter was emphasized. Paul may
have preached, but the Good News saved the believer. However, in
15:3-11, the former was emphasized. The apostles were those &ldquo;sent
by&rdquo; the Risen Christ. They shared not only the Good News, but
their experience of Revelation. In this sense, Good News was tactile.
What they saw and touched and heard changed them. And it had the
power to change others. After they encountered the Risen Lord, they
became the face of Christ to others.</P>
<P>Of course, Paul noted the irony of the experience. He experienced
the Risen Lord on the way to Damascus. In the encounter, his world
was ripped apart. His world view and belief system was turned upside
down and inside out. He was no longer the Pharisee who zealously
lived out obedience to the Law. He was now the Christian preacher who
experienced God outside the Law. And he lived the rest of his life
passing that experience along to others.</P>
<P>Paul drew a direct, clear line of ministry to the appearance of
Jesus. And he charged his audience to carry on the mission.
Evangelization, then, was more than bringing the words of the Good
News to life. It was to live the Good News to the extent that it
inspired others to believe. In other words, evangelization was to be
the presence Christ for others. That presence begins with an
experience of the Risen Christ that began with another believer. The
ongoing chain of experiences traced its way from us, through the
Church, to the apostles that saw the Risen Lord.</P>
<P>What saps the Church of its energy? Its strength? Clearly,
anything that takes it away from its primary mission: to be Christ to

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Luke</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 5:1-11</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>This is a story of commitment to Jesus &ndash; to his message and
his destiny. Luke first mentions Simon (Peter) in 4:38; now Jesus
calls him to be a disciple. In the preceding chapter, we read of
hostility to Jesus; we also learn what preaching the good news of the
kingdom of God involves. We can see the similarity of this passage to
stories in Mark and John: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">vv. 1-3 are like Mark 4:1-2; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">vv. 4-9 are like the
	post-resurrection appearance of Jesus in John 21:1-11; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>vv. 10-11 are like Mark 1:18-20.</P>
</UL>
<P>Perhaps Luke has taken parts of two sources used by Mark and John
and merged them into one story, but perhaps he is using a story not
found in other gospels.</P>
<P>The &ldquo;lake of Gennesaret&rdquo; (v. 1) is the Sea of Galilee.
Gennesaret is the plain on its southwestern shore. The &ldquo;word of
God&rdquo; in Luke and Acts is the Christian message. Are Peter and
Jesus in one boat and &ldquo;James and John&rdquo; (v. 10) in the
other, or they are all in the same boat? The question probably arises
because Luke has merged two stories. Reading on through the gospel,
we come to realize that Luke has a great respect and appreciation for
Peter - called &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; for the first time in v. 8, but
not again until 6:14, when Jesus chooses twelve of his disciples. In
v. 8, Peter responds to Jesus&rsquo; action with personal
self-judgement &ndash; because he recognizes in Jesus more-than-human
power. In v. 5, in calling him &ldquo;Master&rdquo; (equivalent to
<EM>teacher</EM>), Peter is willing to obey Jesus&rsquo; command out
of duty; then in v. 8 he calls him &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;, showing his
belief. V. 10 is a milestone (&ldquo;from now on&rdquo;). The Greek
verb <EM>zogron</EM> (&ldquo;catching&rdquo;) was commonly used of
teachers: they <EM>caught</EM> their students and thereby brought
them new life. Peter, James and John make a total commitment (&ldquo;left
everything&rdquo;, v. 11).</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>When
thinking about call and response, it is today?s gospel lesson that
really challenges me. For even if I can get over my fear of answering
God?s call, and even if I can overcome my disbelief in God?s ability
to use me to do wonderful things, what I struggle with most
consistently then is my desire to always follow God?s call. For God?s
way is difficult. It requires sacrifice and discipline and an
enormous amount of trust and letting go of control. These are things
that I struggle with.<BR><BR>In Luke 5:1-11, Jesus? newfound
disciples do something that I do not know if I would have been able
to do. Jesus takes Peter out into a boat to do some fishing. After
working all night long and not catching a single fish, he asks them
to lower their nets. This time, when they bring up the nets, they are
so full of fish that the nets begin to break and the boats begin to
sink. In biblical times, this must have been like winning the
lottery! And yet the first thing Peter and James and John do when
they get the boats to shore is leave everything behind and follow
Jesus.<BR><BR>I do not know if I won the megabucks jackpot if I would
be able to turn right around and give it all to Jesus. When I think
about the things that I desire most strongly at this stage in my life
they are things like stability and safety and security. For me it is
a very difficult thing to let go of my own plan for my life and
follow God?s plan, especially when God does not always choose to
reveal the fullness of God?s plan.<BR><BR>The disciples are not told
everything about what will happen to them as Christ?s followers. They
are simply told that they are going to become fishers of people. For
them, this is enough to leave their entire life behind and follow
Jesus. <BR><BR>When God calls us, we experience a variety of things ?
fear, unworthiness, resistance. But a call requires a response. We
can respond by hiding and choose to remain in fear and unworthiness
and resistance. Or we can come out of hiding, and respond with trust;
trust in God?s forgiveness; trust in God?s grace; and trust in God?s
plan for our lives.<BR><BR>What will you answer when the Lord calls,
?Whom shall I send?? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Luke 5:1-11</B></P>
<H4>Goin' Fishin</H4>
<P><I>Have you ever gone fishing? What fish stories do you have?</I></P>
<P>I hate to admit it. I've never caught a fish in my life. I've
fished in the clear, fresh water lakes of Minnesota, the running
streams of Colorado, and the warm waters off the coast of Southern
California. I've tried. But, no luck. Been &quot;shunked.&quot;</P>
<P>I can empathize with Simon in Luke's gospel. He worked all night
without a single fish to call his own. Then, he met Jesus. And the
fish came in abundance. So did a call.</P>
<P>On one level, Luke presented Simon's call in a straightforward
manner. After Jesus ordered the fisherman to lower his nets, the
catch overwhelmed Simon. So did the call. On a deeper level, however,
the narrative revealed the influence of the Galilean ministry on the
writing of the gospels (and the Christian tradition).</P>
<P>5:1 &quot;As the crowd pressed around HIM to hear the word of God&quot;
is literally &quot;It happened in the crowd's pressing about him and
hearing the word of God.&quot; The phrase&quot;It happened&quot;
introduced the action of the crowd as a subordinate clause to the
main focus: the action of Jesus. The verb &quot;to hear&quot; depends
upon the verb &quot;to press on.&quot; The crowd came to hear Jesus
by the shore of Lake Gennesaret (also known as the &quot;Sea of
Galilee&quot;), a fresh water lake that feeds the Jordan river.</P>
<P>5:2 &quot;But the fisherman, having left (the boats) were washing
the nets&quot; The fishermen docked the boats, then washed their nets
away from the boats. They were cleaning up after an early morning's
work and getting ready to go home.</P>
<P>5:8 &quot;Simon Peter&quot; Luke anticipated the name Jesus would
give Simon later.</P>
<P>&quot;Lord&quot; The word &quot;Lord&quot; (&quot;Kyrios&quot; in
Greek) is the standard title given to God (and, in Christianity, to
Jesus). This title was different from the one Simon gave Jesus in
5:5. At the point of the great catch, Simon understood the source of
Jesus' power: God the Father.</P>
<P>&quot;I am a sinner!&quot; Simon did not reflect on his own
sinfulness, but upon his lower class status. Only the holy could
perform such miracles. Fishermen were a gruff lot, unworthy of such a
godly man as Jesus.</P>
<P>5:10b &quot;you will capture men alive&quot; Using a fishing
analogy, Jesus invited Simon to follow him. Evangelization is at the
core of the discipleship.</P>
<P>The narrative line was simple. In Luke, Jesus moved to the coast
of Lake Gennesaret (Sea of Galilee) in Capernaum. Here he called his
first disciples (who become his closest friends). The context of the
story indicated that Jesus arrived early in the morning, a time of
day when the fishermen were cleaning up after a night's fishing.
[1-2] Jesus entered the boat of Simon and began to preach to the
crowd. [3] If Simon (the assumed leader) allowed Jesus, the rabbi, to
teach from his boat (an honor that would have raised the reputation
of Simon to a higher level), he certainly would not have objected to
Jesus' next request. So, the teaching of Jesus set up the willingness
of Simon and his partners in the following verses.</P>
<P>Luke enfolded a fish story that turns common sense upside down. To
maximize a catch, fishing was done at night when water was cool and
the activity of the fish was minimal. During the day, the fish would
see the activity of the boats on the surface and, with the water
warming, would easily swim away. Notice Peter's surprise to Jesus'
command, and greater surprise to the size of the catch, enough to
fill two boats! In the sight of the miracle, Peter declares his
sinful status before the man who has the power of God. [4-10]</P>
<P>With the revelation of God's power, Jesus called Peter and friends
to fish for people. Together, they left their boats and their
livelihoods to join with the rabbi. [10-11]</P>
<P>On a deeper level, the impact of the fishermen, Simon, Andrew,
James, and John, upon the Christian tradition cannot be
underestimated. For example, the method of transportation. Without a
knowledge of sailing, how was Jesus, a traveling preacher, going to
visit towns and hamlets along the lake shore line? (Remember the
towns of Bethsaida, Capernaum, Chorazin, Gadara, Gennesaret, Magdala,
and Tiberias?) Enter Simon and his friends.</P>
<P>The commodity Simon and the others used for income had influence.
As a food, fish itself was common in the region, after the discovery
of drying techniques. Fish figured in the stories of the
multiplication of the loaves (Matthew 14.13-21; Mark 6:30-44, Luke
9.10-17; John 6.1-14) and John's post-resurrection narrative that
paralleled this narrative (John 21:1-19). Jesus used fish in his
parable on prayer (Luke 11:11) and in the story of paying the Temple
Tax (Matthew 17:24-26). And, let's not forget the famous IXTHUS or
Christian &quot;fish&quot; symbol of the early Church.</P>
<P>Finally, the fishing boat Simon and his friends used for travel
became a symbol for the Church. When Jesus walked on the water of the
lake (Matthew 14.22-33; Mark 6:45-49; John 6.15-21), the boat in the
storm tossed the doubting disciples about. This image symbolized the
Church in a state of anxiety when it faced persecution.</P>
<P>In his early ministry, Jesus formed a traveling ministry that was
supported the hospitality of believers in a rural lake region. After
his resurrection and ascension, followers formed communities in urban
settings. While there was a real (and radical) shift in setting, the
traditions of Jesus' early lake ministry found its way into the oral
and written gospels of city churches.</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: The Holiness of God (CCC 206-209)</P>
<P>Confronted with the size of catch, Simon realized the power and
presence of God before him. As he begged Jesus to leave, he was
shaken to his core. Before the sign, Simon had his life laid before
him: another nameless, faceless fisherman who would live and die by
the Sea of Galilee. After the sign, however, he faced with a reality
that demanded a response. And a change.</P>
<P>An encounter with God is an experience that transcends our
perceptions. Moses encountered God in the burning bush. When asked
for a name, God responded with an enigma that transcended
understanding: &quot;I Am who I Am.&quot; The name itself described
the unknowable and totally Other. Yet, the name also revealed God's
eternal presence. He who was beyond all understanding would be close,
present to whom he revealed himself. The encounter and the name
revealed told Moses that God always was and always would be present.
God was eternally transcendent, yet eternally immanent. An encounter
with such a reality demanded a response. It could not be ignored.</P>
<P>An encounter with God also transcends our expectations. God is
radically free. And he calls us to his will. We do not call him to
ours. Simon could not anticipate nor expect a call from God. Yet, he
received a call to reach beyond himself and follow the Lord. We, too,
receive the same call. Reach beyond and follow Jesus.</P>
<P><I>How has God &quot;caught you in his net?&quot; How has that
experience changed your life?</I></P>
<P>I've never caught a fish. But that doesn't mean I haven't been
caught. In fact, I was caught a long time ago. Chances are most of
you who have read this have been caught, too. God, through people,
went fishing. God caught more than my average. A lot more. Let's pray
we can be part of that fishing expedition.</P>
<P><I>How can you be part of God's fishing expedition this week?
Remember who the Captain of the boat really is.</I></P>
