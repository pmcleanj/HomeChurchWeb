<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<em>Note: Acts 10:34-43 must be read.</em>
<hr>
<strong>Acts 10:34-43</strong>
<p>The setting is the house of Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian
Regiment, part of the military occupation force in Palestine.
Cornelius, already a believer in God, has had a vision (vv. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A1-8">1-8</a>).
As a result, he has invited Peter to visit. It is against Jewish law
for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile, but Peter comes anyway,
with &#8220;some of the believers from Joppa&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A23">23</a>).</p>
<p>The Greek here is rough, full of grammatical errors, unlike the rest
of Acts, so we may well have Peter's unedited words. He tells the
assembled company that God does not favour Jews over others: anyone,
whatever his nationality, who reveres God and lives in unison with him
&#8220;is acceptable to him&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A35">35</a>). In vv.

<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>1 Corinthians</b>

<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57

<strong>1 Corinthians 15:19-26</strong>

which humanity becomes immortal, for many considered only the soul to
be immortal. Paul has written that if we deny the resurrection, we

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 20:1-18</strong>

<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. 
Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his 
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of 
sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes 
God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and 
lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses 
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles.
