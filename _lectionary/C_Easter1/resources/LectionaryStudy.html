<P><STRONG>Acts 10:34-43</STRONG> 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>This book is the sequel
to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' ascension,
Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means a
comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the
church from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The
episodes he reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He
shows us something of the struggles the church underwent in accepting
Gentiles as members. The Holy Spirit guides and strengthens the
church as it spreads through much of the Roman Empire. </FONT>
</P>
<P>The setting is the house of Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian
Regiment, part of the military occupation force in Palestine.
Cornelius, already a believer in God, has had a vision (vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A1-8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1-8</A>).
As a result, he has invited Peter to visit. It is against Jewish law
for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile, but Peter comes
anyway, with &ldquo;some of the believers from Joppa&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A23" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">23</A>).</P>
<P>The Greek here is rough, full of grammatical errors, unlike the
rest of Acts, so we may well have Peter's unedited words. He tells
the assembled company that God does not favour Jews over others:
anyone, whatever his nationality, who reveres God and lives in unison
with him &ldquo;is acceptable to him&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A35" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">35</A>).

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>This
book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1
to 39 were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700
BC. These were difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a
disastrous war was fought with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel,
the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the
cause of these events as social injustice, which he condemned, and
against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written
during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled with a message
of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some
scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the
book, written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters
speak of hope and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for
worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks
of the hope that God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory
and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT></SPAN>

<H4><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><FONT FACE="Verdana">The
Conversion of Cornelius</FONT></FONT></H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: medium">10:34 &quot;Having opened his mouth&quot;
is a Semitic expression meaning &quot;he began to speak.&quot;</H4>
<P>10:41 &quot;having been appointed by God&quot; is literally
&quot;having God spread his hand over.&quot; This was a sign of
mission.</P>
<P>In this passage from Acts, Peter proclaimed the Good News to the
household of Cornelius, a Roman centurion (leader of a cohort).
Cornelius was &quot;righteous Gentile,&quot; someone who worshiped
the Jewish God and showed partiality to the Jews. According to Acts,
Cornelius' worship and almsgiving to God's chosen were impeccable.
However, Cornelius did not convert; conversion to Judaism meant
resigning his commission in the Army, since military service required
offering incense to an image of the Emperor as a sign of allegiance.
Offering incense to the Emperor's image was considered to be idolatry
to Jews.</P>
<P>Peter came to the house (i.e., family) of Cornelius to preach the
Good News. By entering the house of a Gentile, no matter how
righteous, Peter made himself ritually impure. But this was little
concern to Peter; he was there to proclaim the Good News. This
passage is an early summation of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Notice was is included and what is missing. Peter began with the
reputation of Jesus after John's ministry [37]; the author of Acts
assumes John's life was common knowledge. (Nothing was mentioned
about Jesus' birth or baptism.) Peter summarized the Jesus' public
life as God initiative (anointing of the Holy Spirit and power);
Jesus exorcized, healed, and did good works [38]. (His teachings were
not mentioned, although they did exist in the community in oral
form). Finally, Peter related Jesus' death (as a human act) and
resurrection (as God's action) [39-40].</P>
<P>Peter used the personal witness as a bridge between the events of
Galilee and Jerusalem [39] and again to stress the reality of the
resurrection [41]. Personal witness became God's commission to preach
Jesus as Lord (judge of living and dead) [42]; what they saw was a
command to tell others. Along with personal testimony, the apostles
had Scriptural and traditional standing; the &quot;prophets&quot;
represented the Bible [43]. And the message from the apostles and the
prophets was clear; those who believed (regardless of nation, class,
color or culture) in Christ (i.e., his &quot;name&quot;) would
receive the forgiveness that God offered to all.</P>
<P><EM>Does our faith in Christ' name help us to see everyone as
God's child? Do we accept others, even the &quot;lily and poinsettia&quot;
Catholics, as God accepts us? </EM>

<H4><B>Clean Out the Old Yeast!</B></H4>
<P>In 1 Corinthians 5-6, Paul railed against the loose attitudes of
some in the community. These people bragged about their fellowship
with an incestuous Christian! (5:1) Paul was appalled by their
actions and insisted upon excommunication for the sinner (5:2-6a).
Paul's rant led up to his warning. Using the analogy of the Passover
meal, Paul urged repentance in the community.</P>
<P>Repentance was, of course, a turning away from sin. And a turning
toward God. The turning away implied a change of heart and mind. It
also meant a rejection of the past. In a very real way, the
incestuous Christian represented such a sinful past. His presence was
the &quot;yeast&quot; that could spoil the batter that would produce
the unleavened bread for the Passover celebration. Notice the
Eucharistic undercurrent. If the evil, whether it was the man or the
attitude of boastful acceptance, were allowed to remain, the
Christian celebration of the Passover (i.e., &quot;the Lord's
Supper&quot;), would be polluted (&quot;unclean&quot;) and, so, not
worthy of true worship. So, excommunication and repentance were the
preferred way. God expected the worship of the humble hearted and
those who came to be forgiven. Not the arrogant and the scandalous.</P>
<P>Easter is the time to celebrate the newness of life. It is not too
late to change. Just as Lent is a prelude to Eastertide, this joyous
holiday is an extension of the repentant spirit.</P>
<P><I>Reflect on your Lent. What did you accomplish? What is left
undone? Leave both at the altar. And praise God for the gift of new
life! </I>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>From <A HREF="http://www.word-sunday.com/">http://www.word-sunday.com/</A></H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>Have you ever seen something so unusual that the
experience gave you pause? Did you jump to a conclusion? What
happened?</I></P>
<P>While I have lived in California for the past 40 years, I was born
in Missouri, the &quot;Show Me&quot; state. I tend to have a
skeptical streak. If I see something unbelievable, I don't believe
it.</P>
<P>Yet, there are events and experiences that have stopped me in my
tracks. And have challenged my skepticism. Many times these events
and experiences have deepened my faith life. The only explanation I
can give them is &quot;God.&quot;</P>
<P>One woman had such an experience. She told two others who saw what
she saw. Only one of these witnesses saw God's hand in the
experience. The empty tomb proved a transcendent event.</P>
<P>20:1 &quot;After the Sabbath&quot; is literally &quot;in one of
the Sabbaths.&quot; This is a Semitic term. The plural of Sabbath
meant &quot;week.&quot; So the phrase meant &quot;on the first (day)
of the week.&quot;</P>
<P>20:7 &quot;cloth piece which was on his head...having been tied up
separately in one place&quot; This cloth piece was tied around the
head to keep the mouth closed for burial. The verb used in 20:7c,
&quot;tied&quot; could also be translated as &quot;rolled&quot; or
&quot;folded.&quot; Peter saw the cloth had a definitive shape. The
shape of the cloth could be easily explained as &quot;tied.&quot; The
cloth (which was once around the head) kept its oval shape after it
was removed.</P>
<P>This resurrection scene from John's gospel emphasized the empty
tomb as a cause for faith, not the appearance of Jesus. Later, the
vision of the risen Lord would cause others to believe (Mary
Magdalene in John 20:14-18 and Thomas 20:26-28).</P>
<P>The time frame and the initial audience for encounter with the
tomb was different in John. In the Synoptic gospels, a group of women
(including the Magdalene) reached the tomb just at or after sunrise.
But, in John, Mary Magdalene arrived alone before dawn. Unlike the
other scenes, Mary ran to Peter and the other disciple (18:15) whom
Jesus loved (13:23 and 19:26). They returned and inspected the tomb
before Mary saw the angels (20:11-13). John placed the arrival of
Peter and the other disciple to heighten the importance of the empty
tomb. For John, this took precedent over the vision of angelic
messengers.</P>
<P>Why was the empty tomb so important? Part of the answer could have
been polemical. The audience of John had been ejected from the
synagogues throughout the empire and had endured prejudice by the
Jewish population. One of the attacks on John's audience could have
been a challenge to veracity. &quot;Did your Jesus really rise from
the dead?&quot; Jewish critics could have exclaimed. &quot;Prove it!&quot;</P>
<P>Witness to the empty tomb during burial rites would have supported
Christian claims for their Lord. Especially within a tradition that
prized the service of those who cared for the dead, despite the fact
that such care made one &quot;unclean.&quot; Preparing the body for
burial was a cultural privilege and duty that ranked with care for
the widows and orphans. Caring for the dead elevated one's
reputation. The discovery of the empty tomb took place in the context
of a charitable act. This alone cast the scepter of shame on those
who publically criticized Christians.</P>
<P>But John added another twist. There were two male witnesses to the
event (which, in an ancient Jewish court of law, verified the fact of
the case). With two male witnesses to the empty tomb, the onus was
back upon the critic. The Christian could claim, &quot;We know the
body from a sealed tomb was missing.&quot; It would have been only a
small leap of faith to conclude the Lord had truly risen! The vision
of the angels to a woman and the appearance of a dead man to his
followers could not be so easily dismissed as the signs of lunacy or
a mass hallucination.</P>
<P>Yet, only the disciple whom the Lord loved believed (i.e., made
the connection between the empty tomb and the Lord's resurrection).
After all, Mary Magdalene saw grave robbers as the most likely
suspects for the missing body (yet, why would anyone rob the grave of
a poor, traveling preacher?) The key to understanding the other
disciple's faith is the phrase &quot;the one Jesus loved.&quot; In
John's gospel, Jesus revealed himself to those he loved. After the
resurrection, the &quot;other disciple&quot; (unwavering in faith at
the foot of the cross) was the first to understand, then Mary
Magdalene (20:14-17), next the other disciples and Thomas (20:19-29),
and finally, Peter by name (21:1-23). Those who fully believed in the
time of testing were those who said &quot;yes' to the Lord and who
understood the full impact of the empty tomb. Those who abandoned the
Lord in his hour were the last to come to faith. The Lord loved all
who followed him completely. But who received that love and acted
upon it? The one who grasped the import of the tomb without a body.</P>
<P><I>Have you ever seen God's hand in the unusual? What was it? How
did you know God was responsible for the event?</I></P>
<P>The scene of the empty tomb and two reactions: skepticism (Mary
Magdalene) and faith (the beloved disciple). Many experiences in life
present us with the same options. Was it the activity of the evil?
Or, was it the hand of God? Like St. Paul insisted, these experiences
need to be tested. But we should not draw hasty conclusions. Instead,
we should look to the source of the experience and its &quot;aftershocks.&quot;
Does good come from the experience or more evil? And if good does
result, was God its ultimate cause?</P>
<P>After all, how did you know that the death of Jesus was the will
of God? Look to the empty tomb. You will see the Resurrection!</P>
<P><I>On this glorious day, look at the experiences and events of the
past weeks. Thank God for the good and the bad. Allow that reflection
and prayer to lead you to the joy of the Resurrection. </I>
