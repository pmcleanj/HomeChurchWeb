people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light

joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men
rejoice when they divide the spoil. For thou hast broken the yoke of
his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor,
as in the day of Midian. For every battle of the warrior is with
confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with
burning and fuel of fire. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son
is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his
government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David,
and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgement
and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord
of hosts will perform this.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>From
Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born or began his
ministry in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded Assyria as
the dominant power in the Middle East. He was a witness to the return
to worship of the Lord (instituted by the Judean king Josiah), and
then (after Josiah's death in battle in 609), the return of many of
the people to paganism. When Babylon captured Jerusalem in 587,
Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be a prophet to Judah
and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political and
religious convulsions. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Jeremiah ministered around the
time when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC. In bad times,
he told of God&rsquo;s love for his people. The restoration of the
city is mentioned in vv. 6-9: &ldquo;... this city shall be to me a
name of joy, a praise and a glory ...&rdquo; Our passage was edited
or written centuries later.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Now we hear that it is a
certainty that a time will come when God will complete his
obligations (&ldquo;fulfill the promise I made&rdquo;, v. 14) under
his covenant with the Israelites. Vv. 15-16 are Jeremiah&rsquo;s
prophecy in 23:5-6 with a difference: there it is Judah and Israel;
here it is &ldquo;Judah&rdquo; (v. 16) and &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo;.
The &ldquo;righteous Branch&rdquo; (v. 15) is a king (or messiah) of
David&rsquo;s line; both kings and the messiah were expected to be
just and righteous (godly). Judah will be restored to prosperity
(&ldquo;saved&rdquo;, v. 16); Jerusalem will be protected. Per the
NRSV, it is the city or the &ldquo;Branch&rdquo; that will be called
&ldquo;The Lord is our righteousness&rdquo;, but this may be the name
of a king: thus the Revised English Bible. Vv. 17-18 foretell the
permanence of the Davidic monarchy, and of priests offering
sacrifice. God&rsquo;s covenant with his people is forever, or at
least until the end of the age, i.e. to the start of the messianic
era. God will never break the pact (even if the people deviate from
it).</FONT></FONT></P>

dissent, lived through the reign of three Judean kings: Josiah
(627-609 BC), Jehoiakim (608-598 B.C.), Zedekiah (597-587 B.C.) As he
matured, Jeremiah railed against the political intrigue in Jerusalem
and royal alliances with Egypt against the Babylon. He was
politically influential enough to escape a royal death sentence for
his public critiques. Hence, he was imprisoned.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>In jail, Jeremiah wrote these
verses of hope. Yes, the kingdom would fall. Jerusalem would be left
desolate. But these events would not stop God's plan to restore the
nation and the royal line. In fact, the righteous king would be the
source of national revival.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>True to his vision, Jeremiah
witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile in
586 B.C. But, Jeremiah would not live to see God's people return to
their homeland. Nonetheless, his words gave the people hope. God
would restore the royal line, the king would rule justly, and the
nation would be renewed. This, however, would happen in God's time
and in God's way.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of
collections. The psalms were written over many centuries, stretching
from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile
(about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments,
thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed
be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The psalmist seeks deliverance
from personal enemies. He trusts in God (vv. 1-4); may God never
allow the ungodly (the &ldquo;treacherous&rdquo;, v. 3) to claim
victory over him. Key to maintaining the upper hand is knowing God&rsquo;s
ways, being taught by God (v. 4), accepting God&rsquo;s leadership
(v. 5), coming to know ultimate &ldquo;truth&rdquo; (v. 5): this is
the way to being saved from the scheming of his (and God&rsquo;s)
adversaries. The psalmist nudges God into remembering his &ldquo;mercy&rdquo;
(v. 6, compassion) and &ldquo;love&rdquo;, qualities of God since
time immemorial. In youthful </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">flings</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">,
we deviate from God&rsquo;s ways, but please, Lord, remember my times
of fidelity (v. 7). God does teach his ways to those who have strayed
and who approach him in awe (&ldquo;humble&rdquo;, v. 9). &ldquo;Love
and faithfulness&rdquo; (v. 10) are characteristic of God&rsquo;s
covenant relationship with his people.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>This letter is perhaps the
oldest book in the New Testament. Paul (with Silvanus and Timothy)
founded the church there during his second missionary journey, and as
is recorded in Acts 17, was forced to leave the city due to
persecution. Many Greeks who already worshipped God, many pagans and
&quot;important women&quot; became Christians. The letter was written
from Athens to strengthen the new Christians in their faith. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Paul predicted, when he was in
Thessalonika, that some Christians there would be persecuted. This
has now happened; he has sent Timothy to &ldquo;strengthen and
encourage you for the sake of your faith, so no one would be shaken
by these persecutions&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Timothy has now returned to
Paul in Athens, and has conveyed to him &ldquo;the good news of your
faith and love&rdquo; (v. 6). Indeed, their faith has encouraged Paul
in facing persecution himself.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now he considers their prayer
for him to be a debt to be repaid (&ldquo;in return&rdquo;, v. 9).
Even though he lives continually in gratitude to, and dependence on,
God (&ldquo;before our God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Night and day&rdquo;, v.
10), &ldquo;all the joy&rdquo; (v. 9) their faith brings to him is
hard to repay, but he does give thanks. He also prays that he may
visit them (&ldquo;see you face to face&rdquo;, v. 10) to &ldquo;restore&rdquo;
(or </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">make good</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">)
lacks in their knowledge of the faith, to give them further
instruction in specific areas (likely what will happen when Jesus
comes again: see v. 13). In vv. 11-13, he prays, intercedes with God,
on their behalf: </FONT></FONT>

	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>that their very beings

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>At that time, says 4:13-17,

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>In one of the earliest books in
the New Testament canon, Paul wrote to the Church at Thessalonika
between 50-54 A.D. At the time of letter, the city was a major
seaport to the east of Greece proper. It was the seat of Roman
administration with a diverse and prosperous population. The Church
at Thessalonika was mixed between Gentile and Jew.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>This letter revealed that
despite a strong opposition from the Jewish synagogue, Paul had a
strong affection for the community because they were steadfast in
their faith. Nevertheless, after Paul explained his efforts to see
those in the church, he exhorted them to live chaste lives. The
verses in this study form the bridge between his explanation and his
exhortation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>These verses used a simple
question to create this bridge: How should the Christian live? Paul&rsquo;s
answer was as simple: love the way you have been shown to love.
3:12-13 was a prayer that the community grow in the love that Paul
and his fellow missionaries showed the community. 4:1-2 remind the
community to grow in the Christian life and devotion to God. This
life and devotion were again found in love. Indeed, in these verses,
Paul could reduce the tradition he claimed to receive from Christ
himself in one simple word: love. Christian love is the basis for
missionary work and morality.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Luke
is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New
Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who
accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three
sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings (known as Q for
</FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Quelle</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">)
and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the
poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers.
Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he
wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus has foretold the
destruction of the Temple (v. 6). Some have asked him when this will
occur and what will indicate that it is about to happen (v. 7). Given
that &ldquo;all the people were spellbound by what they heard&rdquo;
(19:48) and that the religious authorities &ldquo;kept looking for a
way to kill him&rdquo; (19:47), the destruction must have spiritual
meaning. Jesus tells of events commonly expected at the end of the
era, and adds some which are specifically Christian. First,
Christians will be persecuted by religious and civil authorities (v.
12). Then there will be &ldquo;wars and insurrections&rdquo; (v. 9),
but &ldquo;the end will not follow immediately&rdquo; (as people
expected). Disastrous natural phenomena, cause for great distress,
will occur (v. 11), and when Jerusalem is surrounded by armies (v.
20), the city will soon fall: either physically or spiritually. Again
the end will be delayed: the killing and deportation of citizens will
continue &ldquo;until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled&rdquo;
(v. 24), i.e. until non-Jews have had the opportunity to come to
Christ.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Now Jesus foretells unnatural
events (&ldquo;signs ...&rdquo;, v. 25) and the resulting confusion
among nations and people, not knowing what will happen next. But the
&ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; (v. 27), the ideal human, Christ, will come
from heaven (&ldquo;in a cloud&rdquo;, a symbol of divine presence,
as at the Transfiguration) with power to control events. Then
&ldquo;redemption&rdquo; (v. 28), God&rsquo;s acts of freeing his
chosen people, will be near. Just as the leafing of trees shows that
&ldquo;summer is ... near&rdquo; (v. 30), so the occurrence of all
these events will show that &ldquo;the kingdom of God is near&rdquo;
(v. 31): this time will be evident to the faithful. The signs will be
as striking as is seen in fig trees: in winter, they look dead but in
spring they sprout. In spite of the delay, the era will end before
all those alive now have died (v. 32). Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;words&rdquo;
(v. 33) are even more eternal than creation (&ldquo;heaven and
earth&rdquo;). Finally, he advises vigilance: do not be so &ldquo;weighed
down&rdquo; (v. 34) with day-to-day earthy matters that you are
unprepared for the final call (&ldquo;that day&rdquo;). It will be
for all those who survive all disasters (v. 35). Pray that God may
give you the strength to resist all evils, so that you may &ldquo;stand
before&rdquo; (v. 36) Christ, be deemed worthy by him.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>21:25-26 In these two verses,
Jesus described the end times in symmetrical fashion. He began with
the numerous signs in the entire sky, reflected events and reactions
on earth, then returned to the shaking of the sky. In the time of
Jesus, most people believed events in the night sky reflected coming
events on earth (the night sky revealed the will of the gods). If
there was trouble in an arena where people had no control (the sky),
certainly trouble would follow on earth.</FONT></FONT></P>

systems on earth, the ancients attributed to God's intervention in
the order of the cosmos. God would shake things up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>People would grow anxious
because their faith systems and rituals failed. They could no longer
control malevolent spirits that drove the sun, the moon, the stars,
or the seas. Without the security their idols gave them, they would
faint at the coming events. For these events would be unknown,
chaotic, and devastating.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>But, Christians were to
rejoice. Their Savior was at hand! Now, their world view and
lifestyle would be vindicated. For, Christians saw the world and
lived in the world differently. Notice Luke implied the division
between the believers and nonbelievers. Further, he implied,
Christians had something to be delivered from: persecution. Finally,
Luke presented a time of hope. Through great power and glory (i.e.,
reputation or &quot;flash&quot; in the popular translation above),
the Son of Man would come and free his followers. Unlike the anxious
people of the world, the Christians were to anticipate the end in
hope.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>21:36 &quot;Stay awake every

is literally &quot;in every moment.&quot; The phrase can refer to
&quot;staying awake&quot; or to &quot;pleading.&quot; By adding the
word &quot;constantly&quot; to pleading, the translation recognizes
both references (&quot;stay awake every moment&quot; and &quot;every
moment pleading&quot;).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;(constantly) pleading
that to have the strength to pass safely through all these (events)
about to happen, and to stand (with conviction) before the Son of
Man&quot; The verb &quot;to plead&quot; or &quot;to pray&quot;
controlled two petitions: strength to endure the end times and the
strength to take a stand as a Christian before the Son of Man. Both
petitions depend upon strength of faith.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>How was the Christian to
anticipate the end? A simple profession of faith was not enough. For
one could be Christian in name, but his or her heart could belong to
the world, its deceptive delights, and its anxieties, Obviously,
self-control was essential.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>In Luke, Jesus added another
condition: unceasing prayer. Unlike first century contemporaries,
early Christians focused their prayer, not necessarily on present
need, but upon future deliverance. They would pray for the coming of
the Kingdom. Jesus encouraged them to pray for a strength of faith
that would enable them to weather the final days and stand before the
judgement seat.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>So, the Christian was to
anticipate the end in two ways: a life of moral self control and
prayer for future spiritual strength. Shouldn't we approach the
holidays in the same way?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Christ Jesus rules now in
heaven. He reveals his power and glory through us, his Church. He is
present when we live with high moral standards and when we pray. He
is present when we get out of the way and allow him to reveal his
power, with us, through us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>But Jesus will come again. His
appearance will be sudden and sure. Until that time, Christians will
suffer from misunderstanding, hatred, and violence. The evil the
world unleashes on the Church will not extinguish the flame of faith.
The Church will be strengthened. And her influence will grow. For
Christ is truly present with his Church in adversity.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Anxiety and anticipation do go
together. They are two reactions to a life under pressure. But one
sees only darkness and despair. The other sees light and hope.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>We can never fully predict
disastrous events, but we can prepare for them. We can live a high
moral life, as if tomorrow does matter. And we can pray for the
strength to live through the darker days. Ultimately we can live as
if Jesus is fully present. We can live with hope fully present.</FONT></FONT></P>

it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
