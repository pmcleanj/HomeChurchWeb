<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>I Samuel 15:34-16:13

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Anointed One

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>?The Lord does not see as mortals see...?

<P>Questions:
<BR>God?s ways are mysterious, it is true, and two of the readings for today evoke a sense of wonder in both narrative and parable illustration of how God takes small things and makes them great.  In the story of David?s anointing by Samuel, there is the tension that builds as the prophet is instructed (mysteriously!) by God not to anoint the obvious choices, the ones the political consultants or pundits would choose today (the ones with the best numbers in the polls or the best faces for television), the ones who somehow appear most qualified or capable because they are older or stronger or more impressive.  ?Surely the Lord?s anointed is now before the Lord,? Samuel thinks as he looks upon the fine elder son Eliab in verse 6.  In some mysterious way, however, Samuel understands that God is concerned with the unseen, the heart, of the person, the very center and core of the one to be anointed.  Bring in the little one, the one left out, the one not considered or included; bring in the shepherd and make him a shepherd-king, anointed by God to lead the people and to live on throughout their history as the greatest of kings, the hope of the people, a vision for the future.  Who would have thought it, that day, as the older, taller, finer sons were brought forward but rejected?  Who knew what potential lay in the youngest, smallest of all?  Who knew what power God would give to the power-less? Seeds are small, too, and often buried or overlooked, but what power lies within them!  Jesus shares two parables in the Gospel reading from Mark that compare the reign of God with the mysterious, slow, hidden way of a seed?s growth, a process that fascinates us even today, in spite of our technological ?wonders? and progress.  It?s like that, Jesus says, the kingdom of God is like that.  Who can know the ways of God, so often hidden from view or not detected (or noticed) by us, but nevertheless at work always and everywhere, bringing about God?s will in unexpected and marvelous ways.  There is so much around us today, as there has always been, that may press us down in spirit.  We may see war and hatred, prejudice and injustice, hunger and violence, the everyday grind of so many lives, the apparent hopelessness and intractability of some problems and conditions.  But this is surely not the whole story. We live not so much in optimism that thinks we can fix everything but out of the hope that God is in charge of everything, and we are called to participate in what God is doing in the world.  That is why we find flashes of brilliant hope and the promise of a greater day to come.  They may only be flashes, but they are powerful epiphanies nevertheless.  Here and there, in longed-for reconciliation within families and among friends, in healing from illness and grief, in the decisions by a community that places its most vulnerable members at the top of its agenda, in sharing and celebration and the release of grudges, in the end of war and the seeking of peace, in the breaking of bread and the nourishment of our souls and our bodies, in giving voice to the voiceless and lifting up the hopes of those in despair, we see the mysterious ways of God.  It may begin, or seem to persist, in smallness, in small steps and small hopes, but the vision, Jesus says, the path leads to greatness, a greatness we cannot see or even imagine today.  God can see it, and God can imagine it, and most of all, God intends it.  The tiny little seed grows into the greatest of all, the mustard tree, strong and mighty and able to make room and provide shelter and goodness and the stuff of life for those who need to find a home.  There are so many large and powerful entities that surround us as individuals and as churches.  Even our own denomination, the United Church of Christ, seems so small when compared to others.  And yet, and yet.  What hope lies beneath statistics and reports, what potential lies in giving voice to the smallest but persistent of witnesses, the early truth-telling of our tradition, the evangelical courage, and the extravagant hospitality that express our commitment and describe our deepest hopes not only for our church but for the world beyond its walls?  As you look at your own life and the life of your church, when were there moments along the way where you could feel God?s hand at work, mysteriously, making choices and offering possibilities that no one would have predicted or thought of themselves?  When were you small and perhaps feeling insignificant, and yet chosen in the end?  Does your church feel small in the community and the world that surrounds you?  Do you see the power and strength of your church in numbers or in the spirit that thrives within it? How can you be the mustard seed that grows and provides shelter and refuge and sustenance to God?s creation and the people of God?

<P><B>I Samuel 15:34-16:13</B>

<P>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD was sorry that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<P> The LORD said to Samuel, ?How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.? Samuel said, ?How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.? And the LORD said, ?Take a heifer with you, and say, ?I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.? Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.? Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, ?Do you come peaceably?? He said, ?Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.? And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, ?Surely the LORD?S anointed is now before the LORD.? But the LORD said to Samuel, ?Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.? Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, ?Neither has the LORD chosen this one.? Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, ?Neither has the LORD chosen this one.? Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, ?The LORD has not chosen any of these.? Samuel said to Jesse, ?Are all your sons here?? And he said, ?There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.? And Samuel said to Jesse, ?Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.? He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, ?Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.? Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.

<P><B>Ezekiel 17:22-24</B>

<P>Thus says the Lord GOD:
	I myself will take a sprig
	from the lofty top of a cedar;
	I will set it out.
	I will break off a tender one
	from the topmost of its young twigs;
	I myself will plant it
	on a high and lofty mountain.
	On the mountain height of Israel
	I will plant it,
	in order that it may produce boughs and bear fruit,
	and become a noble cedar.
	Under it every kind of bird will live;
	in the shade of its branches will nest
	winged creatures of every kind.
	All the trees of the field shall know
	that I am the LORD.
	I bring low the high tree,
	I make high the low tree;
	I dry up the green tree
	and make the dry tree flourish.
	I the LORD have spoken;
	I will accomplish it.

<P>Refrain:
<BR>
Answer us, O God, when we call.
</B>

<P>May God answer you in the day of trouble!
<br>	The name of the God of Jacob protect you!
<p>	May God send you help from the sanctuary,
<br>	and give you support from Zion.
<P>	May God remember all your offerings,
<br>	and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. 
<P>	May God grant you your heart?s desire,
<br>	and fulfill all your plans.
<P>	May we shout for joy over your victory,
<br>	and in the name of our God set up our banners.
<br>	May God fulfill all your petitions.
<P>	Now I know that God will help God's anointed;
<br>	and will answer them from God's holy heaven
<br>	with mighty victories by God's strong hand.
<P>	Some take pride in chariots, and some in horses,
<br>	but our pride is in the name of the Sovereign our God.
<P>	They will collapse and fall,
<br>	but we shall rise and stand upright.
<P>	Give victory to the ruler, O God;

<BR>The righteous flourish like the palm tree.
</B>
<P>	It is good to give thanks to God,
<br>	to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
<P>	to declare your steadfast love in the morning,
<br>	and your faithfulness by night,
<p>	to the music of the lute and the harp.
<br>	to the melody of the lyre.
<p>	For you, O God, have made me glad by your work;
<br>	at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
<P>	The righteous flourish like the palm tree,
<br>	and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
<P>	They are planted in the house of God;
<br>	they flourish in the courts of our God.
<P>	In old age they still produce fruit;
<br>	they are always green and full of sap,
<P>	showing that God is upright;
<br>	God is my rock, and has no unrighteousness.

<P><B>2 Corinthians 5:6-10,(11-13),14-17</B>

<P>So we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord?for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil. Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others; but we ourselves are well known to God, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences. We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. For the love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them.
From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new!

<P><B>Mark 4:26-34</B>

<P>And he said to them, ?Pay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you. For to those who have, more will be given; and from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.?
He also said, ?The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground, and would sleep and rise night and day, and the seed would sprout and grow, he does not know how. The earth produces of itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. But when the grain is ripe, at once he goes in with his sickle, because the harvest has come.?
He also said, ?With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it? It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.?
With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything in private to his disciples.

<P>Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time
<BR>June 18, 2006
<BR>I Samuel 15:34-16:13

<P>THE ANOINTED ONE

         <P>While Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table,
         a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard, and she broke
         open the jar and poured the ointment on his head. But some were there who said to
         one another in anger, ?Why was the ointment wasted in this way? For this ointment
         could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to
         the poor.? And they scolded her. But Jesus said, ?Let her alone; why do you trouble
         her? She has performed a good service for me. For you always have the poor with 
         you, and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not 
         always have me.
															                    Mark 14:3-7

    <P>In her spiritual memoir, Girl Meets God: On the Path to a Spiritual Life (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2002), Lauren F. Winner tells about the month of June she spent teaching at a high school summer camp in tidewater Maryland:

    <P>I attended Sunday morning worship in a little stone church out in the country. They were a bit depleted that summer?-most of the Altar Guild was vacationing elsewhere, gone, perhaps to a little stone church in the mountains for the hot summer months. I volunteered to help Viv, the lone Altar Guilder left at home, bake Eucharist bread....
    When I turned up at her house on a Wednesday evening, she had everything laid out on her yellow kitchen counters: whole wheat flour, white flour, and bottles of sparkling water.
    ?Perrier?? I asked.
    ?Oh yes,? said Viv, ?I always use Perrier in the Eucharistic bread. Mark 14:7, don?t you know....
    ?I take from that story the lesson that when we do something for Jesus, especially something as important as the Eucharist, we shouldn?t just use ordinary ingredients. We should use the finest ingredients! Making Eucharistic bread with tap water would be an insult, don?t you think?  So I always use Perrier.?

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
