<P>Children's Time:</P>
<P>Can you remember the names of some of the Prophets that we have
talked about?</P>
<P>Moses was one: he lived over three thousand years ago, at the time
that the pyramids were being built in Egypt. Isaiah was another: he
lived about 700 years after Moses' time. Another prophet was Anna,
and she lived about 500 years after Isaiah. But even though the
Prophets lived at very different times, they all did the same thing:
they told people about God, and they told people to expect and get
ready for Jesus to come.</P>
<P>Some of the things they said about Jesus were not what people
expected. People expected a Saviour to come, who would be great and
powerful, like God. But Isaiah wrote poems that described Jesus
differently. He described our Saviour as a servant. He said that
people would treat the Saviour unjustly, and that our servant-Saviour
would accept that unjust treatment and show us perfect trust in, and
perfect obedience to the Father. Isaiah wrote four of those poems,
and we call them the &ldquo;Servant Songs&rdquo;.</P>
<P>You would think that with all those prophets describing the
Saviour, and with Isaiah's famous poems describing telling them that
the Saviour would come as a suffering servant, that EVERYONE would
have recognized Him when He came. But, they didn't! Listen very
carefully to the Gospel lesson when Pastor reads it, and you will
hear about all the different ideas people had about who Jesus was,
and most of them were wrong. Only His closest disciples were able to
answer the question rightly: he is our Messiah and Saviour.</P>
