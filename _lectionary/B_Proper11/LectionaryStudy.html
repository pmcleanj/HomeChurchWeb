the calendar-clock to the right date. Pentecost tells the story of
the Church. Over this longest season of the church year, we will
meditate on what it means to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;,
&ldquo;the whole company of Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His
hands and feet in the world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for
Pentecost:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues,
like as of fire, and it rested upon each of them: and they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues,
as the Spirit gave them utterance. </I>

has enjoyed military success over most of the neighbouring nations.
This time, he sends Joab, his commander, with even his own bodyguard
(&ldquo;his officers&rdquo;) and the whole army (&ldquo;all Israel&rdquo;)
to besiege &ldquo;Rabbah&rdquo; (now Amman, Jordan) &ndash; &ldquo;but
David remained at Jerusalem&rdquo;. Bathsheba is daughter and wife of
great warriors (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>).

came from Turkey and conquered Syria and Palestine but by this time
their empire had crumbled; Uriah has joined the Israelites.) The law
(later codified) said that a woman was ritually unclean for seven
days after menstruation (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A4" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>).
Bathsheba conceives by David (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>).</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>David tries to cover his tracks. Uriah is home on leave; if he
will lie with his wife, he will think the child is his. David invites
him to &ldquo;wash your feet&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8</A>),
normal after a journey, and here a euphemism for <EM>have sexual
intercourse</EM>, but Uriah refuses to break the ritual purity of the
warrior (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>);
he sleeps outside (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A9" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>).
For &ldquo;in booths&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>),
the Revised English Bible has <EM>under canvas</EM>: the ark
accompanied the troops into battle, and was housed in a tent. David
offers to delay Uriah&rsquo;s return to the fighting (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>).
Even when made drunk, Uriah &ldquo;did not go down to his house&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>).
So David tries another approach: Joab is to place Uriah in a
vulnerable position so he will be killed (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+11%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>):

David&rsquo;s sin costs Uriah his life; next week we hear of further
consequences.</P>
<P>This is the start of an intimate portrait of the domestic and
political troubles of the royal family and the court, with all their
sordidness and tragic consequences. The military history serves only
as a framework in which to place personal episodes in the private and
public life of the king. The writer does not omit the sin of David
with Bathsheba (as does 1 Chronicles <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Chronicles+20%3A1-3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">20:1-3</A>)
or gloss over it (as in 1 Samuel <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+13%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13:14</A>).

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The story of David&rsquo;s
double sins of adultery and calculated murder form the introduction
to a new and troubled phase of the monarch&rsquo;s reign. He had
already consolidated his power and reinforced it with the nation&rsquo;s
most important religious symbol, the Ark of the Covenant. He had
become strong enough to commit his army to war with the Ammonites who
lived east of the Jordan River. Under the leadership of Joab, the
army were in the process of besieging their capital, Rabbah. Perhaps
unwisely, as vs. 1 appears to imply, David stayed home in Jerusalem.
With too much time on his hands, he spied Bathsheba bathing on a
rooftop and lusted after her. Exercising his assumed rights of power,
he lay with her and impregnated her while her husband was away with
the army.</P>
<P>After messing with another man&rsquo;s wife, he had made matters
worse by sending for Uriah at the front and tried to get him to sleep
with Bathsheba, so he would be recognized as the child&rsquo;s
father. Faithful to his military oath not the sleep with his wife
while on duty, Uriah foiled David&rsquo;s deception. So the king
ordered him sent to the most dangerous part of the battle line where
he would killed.</P>
<P>David&rsquo;s adultery with Bathsheba and his plan to cover it up
by causing the death of her husband remains to this day the symbol of
a very human failure: through pride and the mistaken assumptions
about power, even great leaders often bring about their own demise.
It does not matter that monarchs are few and virtually powerless
today, it still happens to democratically elected politicians who
take advantage of their positions for immoral purposes.</P>
<P>Henry Kissinger, former American Secretary of State once said,
&ldquo;Power is a great aphrodisiac.&rdquo; While still prime
minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill vowed never to preside
over the demise of the British Empire. He didn&rsquo;t, but it
happened anyway, because the empire had already begun to disintegrate
and he was soundly defeated in the next election. David&rsquo;s
willful adultery followed the familiar pattern of human sinfulness.
Perhaps Jesus had this familiar story in mind when he said, according
to Matthew 5:28 &ldquo;I say to you that everyone who looks at a
woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his
heart.&rdquo; Many people sneered at former US President Jimmy Carter
when he admitted to a journalist that he had done what Jesus
condemned. In the more recent past we have seen President Clinton
ruin his promising presidency and bring ignominious shame upon
himself by a dalliance more common on a college campus than in the
highest public office. High office does not protect even the most
powerful from human corruptibility.</P>

It may astonish some to realize that this psalm is almost identical
to Psalm 53. The only explanation for this double appearance is its
prior existence in two distinct collections. Scholars regard Ps. 53
as the better preserved. Of note is the name of Yahweh (&rdquo;the
Lord&rdquo;) in this version while Ps. 53 uses the name Elohim
(&rdquo;God&rdquo;), as do most of the psalms in what is known as
&ldquo;the Elohistic Psalter,&rdquo; (Pss. 42-83) associated with the
Elohist Document of the Pentateuch.</P>
<P>Profound wisdom and a deep sense of social justice lies behind
this psalm: Before Yahweh all people are sinful. But those who are
atheistic receive special condemnation. The end state of unbelievers
is to be greatly feared (vs.5a). A time of retribution is at hand.
Neglect of a spiritual relationship with Yahweh results in the
destruction of truly human nature. As Augustine of Hippo said in his
Confessions, &ldquo;Thou has made us for thyself and our hearts are
restless until they find their rest in thee.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The psalm ends with a plaintive hope that Yahweh will deliver
Israel from some unstated ill fortune. The great prophets often spoke
of an imminent threat of foreign invasion or subjugation to a foreign
overlord as the penalty for the apostasy of the people. This would
indeed be an unmitigated disaster. In those times each nation was
held to have a different god whose power and authority protected the
people. This religious tradition regarded defeat in battle or a
foreign invasion as spiritually ruinous as well as politically and
economically catastrophic. In many respects, this still occurs today
as a result of wars.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3>The story is a simple one, but is linked with the
preceding pericope of another miracle at Gilgal during a famine
(4:38-41). At the time of the first fruits after the famine, a man
brought his thankoffering, twenty loaves of barley, to Elisha, the
man of God. Elisha instructed that the loaves be given to the
assembled prophetic company of one hundred (&ldquo;the sons of the
prophets&rdquo;). So little among so many? At the prophet&rsquo;s
insistence, the donor obeyed. And as the prophet had promised, there
was enough and some left over.</FONT></P>
<P>Long ago the obvious parallel of these anecdotes from the Elisha
cycle with the feeding the five thousand in the four Gospels caught
the attention of anyone reading the scriptures. On the other hand,
one commentator complained that the feeding of the hungry in these
stories does not really compare with those in the Gospels because
&ldquo;those who are reported to have wrought them do no occupy the
altitude of the personality of Jesus.&rdquo; (<EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s
Bible</EM>, II.209)</P>
<P>Be that as it may, many New Testament passages, including several
stories of Jesus, were dependent on Old Testament passages. This
pericope from the Elisha cycle may well have been the basis for the
miracle of the feeding of the five thousand. After all, in the latter
part of the 1st century CE, the only scriptures the authors of the
New Testament knew were the Hebrew scriptures, probably in the Greek
version, known as the Septuagint. They could only understand Jesus in
the light of what they had read in those more ancient and revered
texts.</P>

145:10-18</A>, </I></FONT></B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like several other psalms,
in Hebrew this hymn of praise takes the form of an acrostic. Each
couplet begins with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet. (Cf.
Psalms 9-10, 25, 34, 37, 111-112, 119). This poetic form developed
relatively late and characterized poetry of the wisdom teachers of
the Persian and Greek periods in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.
Despite that severe structural limitation, the psalm possesses a
surprisingly rich spiritual power.</P>
<P>Though the concept of Yahweh as a powerful monarch had developed
much earlier, the idea of Yahweh&rsquo;s sovereignty over all nations
came to the fore only during the prophetic period from the late 8th
to the 6th centuries BCE. The psalm glorifies Yahweh as a ruler whose
greatness is beyond human comprehension (vs.3). Yahweh&rsquo;s
mighty, miraculous acts give rise to this praise (vss. 4-5). But it
is Yahweh&rsquo;s faithful, compassionate justice and tender care for
all people which draws the greatest praise from the psalmist
(vss.17-20). Therefore, the psalmist repeats his vow made in vs.1 to
&ldquo;speak the praise of Yahweh&rdquo; and summons &ldquo;all
flesh&rdquo; to join him (vs. 21).</P>
<P>Few other OT passages reach the inspirational level found in
praising Yahweh&rsquo;s constant love that this psalm expresses (vss.
8-9). What a pity that this part of the psalm has been omitted from
this reading. Nonetheless these few verses reveal the richness of the
psalmist&rsquo;s personal faith. He fixes his hope not only the
sovereignty of divine love (vss. 10-13), but Yahweh&rsquo;s
everlasting faithfulness (vss. 14-18). Herein too lies our hope for
these difficult times.</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: -0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in">As
previously noted, this letter which may have begun as a liturgy for
baptismal candidates at Pentecost. Its first segment (chapters 1-3)
consists of a great prayer of blessing (similar to a Jewish <EM>berakah</EM>)
ending with this rapturous petition that Christ come alive in the
hearts and lives of those who first heard it. The author was probably
not Paul, but one who knew his teaching well. Christian tradition as
well as the added the title and address at the beginning of the
letter attributed it to the great apostle to the Gentiles.</P>
<P>Vs. 14 contains a vivid image of a person at prayer. Standing was
the normal Jewish posture for prayer. Prostration represented
particular intensity. Bowing the knees, presumably with the face
lifted upward and the hands spread out, would appear to be somewhere
between normalcy and ecstasy. William Barclay, however, thought that
the prayer was from Paul himself and was so intense that he was
probably prostrate.</P>
<P>This petition expresses the hope that the Spirit of God would
strengthen his audience spiritually (vs. 16). That would come about
through Christ dwelling in their hearts. This is the imaginative
effect of faith in Christ. As the old Sunday school chorus
resoundingly proclaimed, they would have &ldquo;the love of Jesus
down in their hearts.&rdquo; The image Paul used was that of a tree
firmly rooted in the ground.</P>
<P>In his recent book,<EM> Rabbi Paul</EM>, Bruce Chilton states that
Paul&rsquo;s success as an evangelist lay in his ability to convey to
others the saving experience of the formation of Christ within them.
In the life, death and resurrection of Christ, the fullness of the
love of God had been made abundantly clear. Through the working of
the Spirit in the believer, Christ came alive once again so that our
human lives become a reflection of him.</P>
<P>Like a swiftly changing video, the image in Paul&rsquo;s mind
changed to one that appears almost architectural or even
astronomical. To know what a building is like, it must be measured in
all its spatial perspectives &ndash; length, breadth, depth, height.
The love of Christ is such that it cannot be measured or fully
comprehended. Indeed, when the love of God in all its fullness
invades, dwells in and fills the human heart, as Barclay and Chilton
note, it is as if Paul has asked us to look at the whole universe and
measure it. This will give all who believe the power to love as
Christ himself loved.</P>
<P>A final benediction ascribes praise to God who is able to do far
more than anyone could ever ask or imagine. The NSRV translation
loses much of the poetic grandeur of the KJV: &ldquo;Now unto him who
is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think
&hellip;.&rdquo; An early 20th century evangelist once put in this
way: &ldquo;God is able to do all that we ask or think;&hellip; above
all that we ask or think;&hellip; abundantly above all that we can
ask or think; &hellip; exceeding abundantly above all that we can
ever ask or think.&rdquo;</P>
<P>That is how Paul thought of the church, a fellowship of infinite,
boundless, universal, eternal love. The church exists to give glory
to God who could do all that through love fully revealed in Jesus
Christ. Would that this were so!</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stories of the feeding

(where he translates &ldquo;reached the land&rdquo; as <EM>got by the

The feeding of the five thousand is the only miracle that appears in
all four gospels. John&rsquo;s version of the tradition varies from
the others in that this miracle depicts yet another of the
distinctive signs by means of which Jesus reveals his divinity. Mark
and the other synoptic gospels tend to use it to deepen the mystery
about Jesus&rsquo; identity.</P>
<P>Knowing how the multitude would be fed and of the danger he was in
revealed his omniscience (vs. 6). Performing the miracle not only
filled the crowds&rsquo; need for food, but convinced them that he
was &ldquo;the prophet who is to come into the world&rdquo; (vs. 14).
This may be a reference to Elijah whose return was thought to precede
the coming of the Messiah. On the other hand, it may actually be a
messianic reference. Immediately John reports that Jesus realized
that the crowd intended &ldquo;to make him king,&rdquo; according to
their perception of the Messiah. Knowing this is another indication
of Jesus&rsquo; omniscience. Later, walking on water while the
disciples crossed the lake in a boat against strong winds revealed
his omnipotence. These several small clues represent John&rsquo;s
intention that the events pointed beyond themselves to Jesus&rsquo;
divine nature.</P>
<P>The passage cannot be read in isolation from the rest of the
chapter. As in other instances throughout the Fourth Gospel, John
used this miraculous sign to introduce a discourse by Jesus about its
true meaning (vss. 25-59), including another of his &ldquo;I am &hellip;&rdquo;
sayings (vs. 35). Furthermore, John saw these events and the
discourse as the turning point in Jesus&rsquo; ministry. The
narrative of the discourse is set in a running debate with &ldquo;the
Jews&rdquo; (vss. 25, 28, 34, 41-42, 52). The end result separates
believers from disbelievers, including many of his erstwhile
disciples (vs. 66).</P>
<P>Did John have access to a tradition unknown to the earlier gospel
authors? More than likely, John knew the same tradition as they, but
had engaged it as a theological reflection more explicitly suited his
literary purpose. No hidden Messiah as in Mark; no new Moses as in
Matthew; no compassionate friend of Jew and Gentile as is Luke; this
is the sovereign Son of God, fully revealed in all his power and
glory. He moves steadily forward knowing where he is going and what
he must do to achieve his mission, almost above the ebb and flow of
the world around him, yet in total control of all that happens.</P>
<P>Disciples, crowds, opponents alike all contribute to his
self-revealing ministry. As at the moment of the first creation, in
him light had come into the world. Exposed to this light, all people
must decide where they stand, in the light with him or hiding from
him in the darkness of their alienation. By him food for body and
spirit is freely provided. Each person has only to decide whether to
accept or reject it. To see him exercise his creative and redemptive
power with a few loaves and fish or walking on water is not just
astonishing, it is terrifying even to those who have been closest to
him. Once reassured as to who he really is amid the stormy waves and
strong winds, they are safely ashore (vss. 18-21).</P>
<P>The passage can be seen as a midrash, a theologically interpretive
narrative. The events form a microcosm of life. Without expressing it
in so many words, it asks and answers the question: &ldquo;Who do you
say that I am?&rdquo;</P>
