friend told of a Pentecost story that happened in her home church.
Everything was ready for the day. People were dressed in red; red
chrysanthemums gave fire to every corner of the sanctuary. Glorious
hymns had been sung: “O Day Full of Grace,” “Veni Sanctus Spiritus.”
The time came for the reading of the Pentecost text. One parishioner
after another stood up to tell, in one language after another, of “the
rush of a violent wind” that “filled the entire house where they were
sitting,” of “divided tongues of as of fire” that descended upon the
believers at the birth of the church. <br>
<br>
Then a word came from the back and center of the sanctuary. “Fire!” No
one moved, initially. None of the readers halted their speech. This
must be one more way to bring the text of the day to life, one more way
to envision the power unleashed through the gift of the Spirit. But the
cry came louder, and with greater intensity. “Fire!” Now, all activity
ceased. The worshipers, as one body, turned to see who it was that was
making the cry, and why.<br>
<br>
The words had been shouted by a well-respected member of the
congregation. He held a fire-extinguisher in his left hand. The
fire-extinguisher was dripping. “There’s a fire in the basement
kitchen—we’ve got it somewhat under control, but we haven’t been able
to get it out yet- it’s terribly smoky down there and is only going to
get worse. I didn’t want the smoke or the smell to startle you in the
middle of worship.” He laughed, “So I guess I interrupted everything
instead.” <br>
<br>
The fire was put out, and the fire damage tended to. The congregation
remembers that Pentecost Sunday the day tongues of fire surely did move
through their midst! Fire comes on Pentecost Sunday, fire and wind. We
rejoice that the Spirit moves among us still, calling, gathering,
enlightening, even as the Spirit moved over those first believers,
creating, from them, the church. We celebrate the power of the Spirit
among us— power as fire, as wind. It is the Spirit who gives life to
our faith. It is through the Spirit that we are given precious gifts to
share with the community—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness. It is by the Spirit’s presence
among us that we sing our witness to the one who was crucified but is
now risen from the dead, by the Spirit’s presence that we are bold to
share the gospel as the good news that it is.

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philip
wants one more sign that Jesus is of God. “Show us the Father,” he
says, “and we will be satisfied.” One can almost imagine Jesus’
chagrin. “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do
not know me?” Philip should see by now: Jesus and the Father are one.
But Philip can’t see. His eyes are blinded to it. Indeed, it will take
more than human understanding for any of the disciples to come to
faith. So Jesus promises the gift of the other Advocate, the “Spirit of
truth.” By the gift of the Spirit, the disciples’ eyes will be opened.
They will be enabled to confess that is, as he has said, one with the
Father. <br>
<br>
Others will be as blind to the Spirit’s presence as was Philip to
Jesus’ identity. The world “neither sees him or knows him.” The
disciples will know of the presence of that fire, that wind, however.
They will know because the Spirit will be present among them, making
itself known. They will know the Spirit because the Spirit will “abide”
with them, even “be in” them. They will know because the Spirit will
move in their midst, reminding them of all that Jesus has said. Their
belief itself will witness to its presence. And those in the world?
They will need to see Jesus to see the Spirit, and need the Spirit to
see Jesus.

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once
more the note is sounded. The very ability to cry, “Abba, Father” is
witness to the Spirit’s presence in the church. And the ability to cry,
“Abba, Father” leads the church in the direction it takes toward life.
We do not live by “fear”—anxious worry over what will happen in the
next moment to us, to our loved ones, to the world. The ability to cry,
“Abba, Father” bears witness to the hope that we have, in Christ, of
seeing ourselves as “children of God.” It bears witness to the hope
that we have, in Christ, of counted ourselves as having been adopted.
And as beloved children, as loved ones taken into a family, we know we
are, and will be, well taken care of. We will be “glorified” with him.
