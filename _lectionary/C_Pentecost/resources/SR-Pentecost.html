						</div>
						<h4>Spiritual Gifts</h4>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>3b No can say "Lord Jesus" unless he lives in the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>4
While there are many kinds of gifts from God, we all share the same
Spirit. 5 While there are different ways to serve others, we all share
the same Lord. While we might do different jobs in the community, we
all share the same God who does all these things in everyone. 7 God
gave each of us a way to show the Spirit for everyone's good.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>12
Think of a body. It has many different parts, but it is still a single
body. It is the same way in our relationship with Christ. 13 Because of
God's Spirit, we were all baptized into one body, no matter who we are
or what we have. And we all drank from the same Spirit.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>3b No one is able to say "Lord Jesus" except in the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>4
There are differing (types) of (graced) gifts, but there is the same
Spirit. 5 There are differing (types) of service, and the same Lord. 6
There are differing (ways of) work, but the same God working all of
them in everyone. 7 To each is given a manifestation of the Spirit
toward the profit (of all).</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>12
For just as the body is one, and it has many members, all the members
of the body, being many, are one, thus (it is) also (with) Christ. 13
For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jew or
Greek, slave or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</b></p>
						<p class="bodytext">Unity
and diversity. Think of the multi-cultural culture we now live in. Not
only are we racially and ethnically mixed, we also have many
expressions of tradition and language. In the past, such differences
would have been kept separated in the ghetto for two generations until
there was cultural assimilation. But, with the many media avenues for
news, our differences are much more apparent, even threatening.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
image of the Church far outdates our culture, but the tensions we face
were real to those in Corinth. There were class and ethnic differences
in the community. But, in addition, there were many different behaviors
that manifest "spiritual gifts." But, unlike some modern commentators
who seek to encourage differences over unity or to suppress differences
for the sake of unity, Paul encouraged these "spiritual" behaviors as a
sign of God's presence. Prophecy, utterances of wisdom, speaking in
tongues, teaching, all were different gifts of the Spirit for the good
of the community. Notice, Paul pointed to everyone in the community as
a person with a spiritual gift. He implied the use of such gifts should
be exercised, not suppressed. But, at the same time, he pointed to the
reason the gifts were given: the good of others. Gifts were not to be a
sign of self-glorification. No, they were for the glory of God!</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Like
the Corinthians, we all have gifts to offer for the common good and the
praise of God. How we use them, however, determines their
effectiveness. And our intention. Do our gifts unite or divide? Do they
show we are one in the Body of Christ? Or, do they reveal divisions
that crack the face of the Church?</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The Spirit gave us his gifts. Let us use them wisely.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>What
gifts do you bring to the Church? How can you help to build up the
community? How can your gifts and service give praise to God? </i></p>
