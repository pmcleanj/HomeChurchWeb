						<h4>The Holy Spirit, The Force of Forgiveness</h4>

							<p class="bodytext"><i>How is God's Spirit different from the Force in Star Wars?</i></p>
							<p class="bodytext">George
Lucas has released Star Wars onto video and DVD. Children of all ages
can now relive the saga of the most profitable series in movie history.
They can root for the Light side of the Force, and boo the Dark Side.</p>

Holy Spirit found in Christianity does not mirror the dual nature of
the impersonal Force. Why? The Holy Spirit brings us love and hope.
Love and hope do not have a dark side. And, both love and hope begin
with forgiveness.</p>

							<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
							<p class="maroontext"><b>19
Late Sunday evening, the followers of Jesus locked the doors of the
place where they met because they feared the Jewish leaders. Jesus
appeared in the middle of them and said, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you."</font>
20 After he spoke, Jesus showed them the wounds in his hands and his
side. They felt great joy when they saw the Lord. 21 Again, Jesus said
to them, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you. Just as the Father sent me, I am sending you."</font> 22 Then, Jesus blew on them. <font color="#f00000">"Take in the Holy Spirit,"</font> Jesus said.</b></p>
							<p class="maroontext"><font color="#f00000"><b>23 "If you forgive someone's sins, their sins are and will ever be forgiven.<br>
										If you don't forgive their sins, their sins are not forgiven."</b></font></p>
							<p class="bodytext">Like
many other Resurrection stories, John divided this passage into two
blocks: appearance of the Risen Lord and the commission of the
disciples. For John, the breathe of the Spirit was the sign and
substance of the commission.</p>
							<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
							<p class="bluetext"><b>19
Being evening in that first day of the week, and the doors having been
locked where the disciples were because of fear of the (Jewish
leaders.), Jesus came and stood in the middle (of them) and said <font color="#f00000">"Peace to you."</font> 20 Having said this, he showed (his) hands and side to them. The disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</b></p>
							<p class="indent">20:19
"evening in that first day of the week" is literally "evening in that
day, the first one of the sabbaths." The use of the plural "sabbaths"
indicates the time frame of a week.</p>
							<p class="indent">"(Jewish
leaders)" is literally "Jews." John used generic language to indicate
specific groups within in the general culture. "Jews" were members of
the Jewish leadership. "Greeks" were the non-Jewish populace (not
people born in Greece).</p>
						</div>
						<p class="bodytext">The
scene in the gospel opened with fear and apprehension on the part of
Jesus' followers. John originally wrote "they feared the Jews." Clearly
John referred to the Jewish leaders, especially the Pharisees. So the
popular translation reflected the relationship between Jesus and the
Pharisees.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">We should also note the
relationship between John's community and Jewish synagogues led by
Pharisees. By the time John wrote his gospel, Jewish Christians had
been excommunicated for their belief in the Messiah. Ostracized and
socially persecuted, some Christians reacted in fear, while others
boldly proclaimed the gospel. Early Christians needed as sense of
stability, a sense of divine peace. Through the words of Jesus, "Peace"
was John's prayer for his readers.</p>
						<div align="right">
							<p class="bodytext">With
the sight of Jesus, fear turned into great joy. Anxiety turned into
relief. Desperation turned into vindication. Most important, a lack of
spiritual direction turned into a sense of deep spiritual grounding.
The divine presence stood close to them. And with the divine presence
came divine peace.</p>
							<p class="bluetext"><b>21 Jesus said to them again, </b><font color="#f00000"><b>"Peace to you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you."</b></font><b> 22 Having said this, he blew on and said to them, </b><font color="#f00000"><b>"Take
(in) the Holy Spirit. 23 If you sent away the sins of anyone, they have
been sent off for them. If you hold (their sins) back, they have been
held back."</b></font></p>
							<p class="indent">20:23 This is an
extremely awkward set of sentences. The sentences are literally "Of
whomever you might sent away (their) sins, they have been sent away for
them. Of whomever you might hold, they have been held."</p>
							<p class="indent">The
key theological phrase is "they have been sent away;" the verb is in
the past tense, indicating the sin had been forgiven before the
pronouncement of the Church.</p>
							<p class="indent">On the one
hand, Jesus already suffered for that particular sin and all the sins
of the world. Hence, the declaration would be a proclamation of the
Good News. (The current form of Sacrament of Reconciliation stresses
this proclamation. In the sacrament, we are to celebrate God's
forgiveness, not our sinfulness.)</p>
							<p class="indent">On the
other hand, the implication of "pre-forgiveness" might lead to
presumption on the part of the sinner or a sense of blessed
predestination. Obviously the former sense is meant, not the later. God
holds everyone responsible for their actions, both of sin and of faith.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">Jesus
commissioned his followers to partake in his Messianic ministry. At the
time of Jesus, Jews believed the Messiah mission at the end of time was
universal. They held the Messiah would go out from Jerusalem to the
known world, spread the Good News of salvation, and incite a massive
pilgrimage to Palestine. As he gathered all Jews spread throughout the
world home, he would call all peoples to Jerusalem so they, too, could
worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Jerusalem, the Messiah
would judge this massive throng in a Final Judgement, the Day of Yahweh.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">The
Resurrection appearance marked the starting point for this process.
From Jerusalem, Jesus sent his followers out as missionaries to the
known world. They would testify to the Risen Christ as the Good News of
salvation. And the Good News would start the journey home for both Jews
and Gentiles.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">What happened to the
Jerusalem pilgrimage? There were two possible answers. First, the
Romans leveled Jerusalem in response to the Jewish revolt in 66 A.D.
Both the city and the Christian mother church turned to rubble. The
Jerusalem church could no longer commission missionaries.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">Second,
Christians spiritualized the pilgrimage. The return home always
included the theme of repentance; the sinner who walked away from God's
dwelling place turned around and journeyed back. For the Christian, a
heavenly Jerusalem became an abode for God. The sinner could find
earthly reflection of Jerusalem in the local church community. Hence,
conversion and repentance were close to home.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">So,
the followers saw their vocation within God's plan of salvation. The
Father sent the Son into the world to lead everyone back to the Father.
Jesus would involve his followers in that same work. Since they
witnessed Jesus risen, his followers would witness to others.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">But
Jesus gave them more than a witness. He gave them the Holy Spirit. The
breathe and command to "Receive the Holy Spirit" must be seen as two
parts of the same action. "Them" (the followers) was the object of
"Jesus breathed on" and the indirect object of "Jesus said." As Jesus
breathed the Holy Spirit out, the text inferred, his follower would
breath it in, just as Jesus commanded.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">We
have already discussed the connection between breathe and Spirit in
past studies. The word for "Spirit" in both Greek ("pnema") and Hebrew
("ruah") was the same for breathe or wind. Ancient people believed that
any moment of air was the result of power. Breathe was the result of an
inner power, one's life force or spirit. Strong winds that caused death
and destruction were the result of God's inner power judging sin. The
breathe of inner life and violent winds, Jews believed, came from one
source, God. So, God's Spirit was a life-giving, and life-taking power.
(See Genesis 1:1 and Acts 2:7).</p>
							<p class="bodytext">Once
the followers breathed in God's Spirit, they shared in the Messiah's
power of judgement with the power to declare sins forgiven. John 20:23
referred to the followers' preaching of the Good News. Missionaries
like the apostles and Paul, proclaimed a reconciliation of sinners to
the Father through Christ; when sinners repented and converted to
Christianity, they were cleansed in the waters of baptism. In the
context of this verse, the process of reconciliation began with the
proclamation of the Good News (declare sins forgiven) and continued
through baptism (they are forgiven).</p>
							<p class="bodytext">Notice
the verb "are forgiven" is in the perfect tense. Forgiveness began in
the past, continues into the present, and trails off into the
indefinite future. In other words, once forgiven, always forgiven. But,
does forgiveness begin with the preacher's declaration? No. The
forgiveness of all sin began with Christ on the cross. The apostles and
their successors proclaimed a forgiveness that flows from Christ's
death and resurrection; the sinner partook in that forgiveness at the
point of repentance, of turning one's life over to God.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">An
aside: Catholics refer to John 20:23 as the basis for the Sacrament of
Penance (also known as Reconciliation or Confession). In a Church that
is an assembly of sinners, this insight makes perfect sense. Christ
continually calls the Church to never ending conversion, just as the
Christian life is a constant road back to God. The sacrament is a
celebration of God's forgiveness in which the priest represents God and
Church to the penitent. The priest proclaims the Good News of divine
mercy to the penitent, advises him or her in spiritual counsel, and
declares the penitent forgiven. In response, the penitent prays or
performs an act of justice that symbolizes an openness of heart to God
and neighbor (a so-called "penance"). In this way, the sacrament
harkens back to Baptism (which is the original context for this verse)
and, so, derives its power from Baptism. The Sacrament of Penance,
then, continues the process of repentance Baptism put into place.</p>

								<p class="tealtitle">Catechism Themes:  Pentecost (CCC 731-732)</p>
							</center>
							<p class="indent">With
the power of the Spirit revealed at Pentecost, the activity of the
Trinity was made known. God the Father sent his Son to share his very
life, his very Spirit, with his followers. Now, disciples would carry
on the work of the Son. They would celebrate the Spirit in their daily
lives as they followed in the footsteps of their Lord.</p>
							<p class="bodytext"><i>God
calls everyone to repentance, even second chances. How do you respond
to his call? How do you help others with their call to conversion?</i></p>
							<p class="bodytext">Pentecost
revealed the power of God's forgiveness, his Spirit. Unlike the Force
of Star Wars, the Spirit of God is personal. The Spirit establishes a
link between the believer and the person of the Father through the
person of the Son. And the Spirit makes that link personal. It is a
link of love, hope, and joy based upon personal forgiveness.</p>
							<p class="bodytext">Let us rejoice in the Spirit, the third person of the Trinity.</p>
							<p class="bodytext"><i>How can I celebrate a life in the Spirit this week?</i></p>
