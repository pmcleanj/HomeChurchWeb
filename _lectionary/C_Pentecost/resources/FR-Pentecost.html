						<h4>Gift of the Spirit</h4>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>1
When Pentecost day arrived, everyone gathered together in one place. 2
Suddenly, a noise came from heaven that sounded like a violent wind.
The noise filled the house where they sat. 3 Then fiery tongue spread
out and sat on each person there. 4 Everyone was filled with the Holy
Spirit. And they began to speak foreign languages as the Spirit
directed them to.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>5 Devout Jews
from all over the world lived in Jerusalem at the time. 6 When they
heard the disciples speaking, a large number of these Jews gathered
together. The people in the crowd were confused because each one of the
disciples spoke to them in their own language. 7 They were stunned, and
kept wondering, "Aren't all these people from Galilee? 8 We hear them
speak in the language where we were born. How can this be? 9 There are
Parthians, Medes, and Elamites here. There are also people from
Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia Minor. 10 We can see
those from Phyrgia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Libya by the
Cyrene. 11 There are those visiting from Rome, both Jewish born and
converts. There are even Cretans and Arabs. 12 All of us hear God's
greatness proclaimed by these people in our own languages!"</b></p>

						<p class="bluetext"><b>1
On arrival of the day of Pentecost, all were together in the same
(place). 2 Suddenly, there was a sound came from heaven, like a violent
wind brought forth, and it filled the entire house where they were
sitting, 3 and tongues like fire completely spreading out were seen by
them, and (the tongue) sat upon each one of them, 4 and all were filled
with the Holy Spirit and they began to speak in other languages as the
Spirit was giving them to speak out.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>5
There were Jews living in Jerusalem, reverent men from every nation
under heaven. 6 As (there) were these voices, a (large) number (of
Jews) came together and were confused, because (they) were hearing each
one (of the disciples) speaking to them in their own language. 7 They
were amazed and kept wondering, saying, "Look! Are not all these
speaking Galileans? 8 How do we each hear in our own language in which
we were born? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, the (ones) living in
Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia, 10 both Phyrgia and
Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya by the Cyrene, and the
visiting Romans, 11 both Jews and converts, Cretans and Arabs, we (all)
hear them declaring the greatness of God in our tongues!"</b></p>
						<p class="indent">2:1
"day of Pentecost" The word "Pentecost" is literally "fifty." The
festival referred to the Feast of Grain Harvest which was celebrated
fifty days after Passover (the Feast of Unleavened Bread). While it was
an agricultural feast, it gained an association with the reception of
the Law on Mt. Sinai. Although the feast began to lose its agricultural
significance in the inter-Testamental period (300 B.C. to 100 A.D.),
most scholars believe this connection was finally made after the
destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D. Pentecost was one of three feasts
that encouraged pilgrimage.</p>
						<p class="indent">2:2 "it filled
the entire house where they were sitting" Sitting was the position of
education. Hence, Luke painted the disciples as students of the Spirit.</p>
						<p class="indent">2:5
"living in Jerusalem" is a loose term that should not be confused with
residency. Luke portrayed the city with a cosmopolitan flavor and as a
pilgrimage stop. The crowd could contain both locals and visitors.
Luke's point was not the composition of the crowd as it was the
universal import of the mission and the message.</p>
						<p class="indent">2:6
"As (there) were these voices" is literally, "As the sound happened."
While the sound could have been the noise like the wind or the
proclamation of the disciples, the context argued for the later
interpretation.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Breathing and life go hand-in-hand. While we might take both for granted, deny our breathe and we will panic about life.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">To
the ancient peoples, breathing was the sign of spirit, a person's life
force. In fact, spiritus (Latin), pneuma (Greek), and ruah (Hebrew) all
mean breathe and spirit.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">When applied to
the God, these words mean breeze or wind; many ancient people believed
that winds were the result of God's breathe. And, by breathing, God
gave life. In Genesis 1:2, God breathed his Spirit upon the waters as a
mighty wind and life began.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Among Jew,
the once agricultural feast of Pentecost [1] now celebrated the
reception of God's Law on Mt. Sinai. Luke changed this feast into the
reception of the Spirit by Christians. God's breathe filled the house
like a mighty wind, and new life began in the followers of Jesus. [2].</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Then,
flames spread over the followers like a wind driven wild fire. This was
a sign for enlightenment (fire in the mind) and passion (fire in the
belly) [3]. With insight and motivation, the followers of Jesus spread
the Good News to others in ways that were clearly understood [4-6].</p>
						<p class="bodytext">As
a center for worship on a major feast day, Jerusalem swelled with
visitors from all parts of the known world. These visitors ( mixed with
locals) gathered around and heard the proclamation of God's great acts
in their native tongues [7-11].</p>
						<p class="bodytext">At the
first Christian Pentecost, God breathed his Spirit and changed the
followers of Jesus. They were new creatures, for God's very Spirit
dwelled within them. With their words proclaiming God's mighty acts,
Jesus' followers breathed out God's Spirit on others. And God's People
were gathered together.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>As the place
whether God's Spirit dwells, we are his instruments in the world. What
we think and say and do spreads God's life giving breathe to others.
How do we measure up to this privilege and responsibility? </i></p>
