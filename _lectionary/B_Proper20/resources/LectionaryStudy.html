7:1-6, 9-10; 9:20-22</A> <BR><FONT SIZE=2>Regarding the Book of
Esther, Chris Haslam at
<A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?</A>
writes: &ldquo;Esther is an unusual book of the Bible: it never
explicitly mentions God (although there are probable implicit
references). It is a short, thrilling, novel about the escape of Jews
from annihilation in Persia. The story revolves around the royal
court of Ahasuerus (Xerxes), who ruled from 486 to 465 BC. It is
Esther, his Jewish queen, who risks her status (and perhaps her life)
to reverse the royal edict and have the vizier hanged. Written much
later, it explains the origin of the Jewish festival of Purim, one of
only two feasts not prescribed by Mosaic law. Its themes of divine
help to persecuted Jews and the destruction of all their enemies are
also found in other books probably written after the Exile, such as
Judith and Daniel&rdquo;</FONT> 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">This book is a novella set in
Persia during the Exile. Ahasuerus (probably Xerxes I, 486-464 BC)
the king has banished Queen Vashti for disobedience. Esther, a Jewish
orphan, has been brought up by her cousin, Mordecai. When the king
seeks a new queen, Mordecai offers her as a candidate, without
revealing that she is Jewish. She is chosen. Mordecai then discovers
a plot to assassinate the king; he tells Esther, who tips off the
king. Ahasuerus&rsquo; life is spared. The king makes Haman his
vizier (prime minister). Custom required all to bow to the vizier,
but Mordecai refuses to do so, so Haman plots to destroy Mordecai,
who has now revealed that he is a Jew. Haman decides to destroy all
Jews, not just Mordecai. A date for the slaughter is set by </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">lot</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
(Akkadian: </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">pur</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">).
Haman gains the king&rsquo;s consent for his plan: Haman argues that
&ldquo;their laws are different from those of every other people ...&rdquo;
(3:8). He even offers a bribe to those who will kill Jews. A royal
decree is sent out by courier to all the land. Through a servant,
Esther learns of the plot. At Mordecai&rsquo;s urging, she risks her
life by going into the presence of the king uninvited, to make a
request of him. The king agrees that she may ask him at a banquet.
Meanwhile, Haman prepares a gallows on which to hang Mordecai &ndash;
on the date set by lot. The king recalls that Mordecai saved his
life, and says that he intends to honour someone (but doesn&rsquo;t
say whom); Haman thinks he is the one to be honoured.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now we hear about the events at the banquet.
The king is willing to grant Esther almost anything (7:2). She asks
that she and her people be spared (thus admitting that she is
Jewish). She would accept being in slavery (via Haman&rsquo;s bribe)
but to be &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; (7:4) causes her to risk her life.
Esther names Haman as their &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; (7:6). Haman, in
begging her for his life, by throwing himself on to Esther&rsquo;s
couch, violates harem law; and the king takes this as sexual assault
(7:7-8). Haman&rsquo;s face is &ldquo;covered&rdquo;, probably as
preparation for his execution. Justice is poetic, as Haman is hanged
in place of Mordecai (7:9-10). Chapter 8 tells of the revocation of
the edict, of Mordecai becoming vizier, and of an edict restoring the
rights of Jews. 9:20-22 tell us that this story is the origin of the
Jewish festival of Purim. Except for this feast and Hanukkah, all
Jewish festivals are prescribed in Mosaic law. While the book appears
to be non-religious fiction (God is never mentioned by name), it
teaches a lesson: God does save his people in ways not found in the
Law. He is with his people, even in Exile.</FONT></P>

writes: &ldquo;Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were
written over many centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's
temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are
of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal
psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;
there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the
end of each book.</FONT>

enemies would have &ldquo;swallowed us up&rdquo; (v. 3) and the
&ldquo;flood would have swept us away&rdquo; (v. 4) - water was
always considered uncertain in ancient times. Then, vv. 6-8: because
God was on our side, he has delivered Israel from being like a

grumbling Israelites who desired meat, not just manna. Addressing
God, Moses lamented over their demands. God answered Moses' prayer by
gathering the leaders and sending quail meat to the Israelites. But
God afflicted the people for their greed with a plague. Hence, the
place was called &quot;Graves of Greed.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Moses could not lead the people alone. God
used others as his instruments, including those not recognized as
leaders [25-26]. The spirit of God gave the gift of prophecy, not the
Israelite chain of command. That fact did not stop Joshua, Moses'
right hand man, from objecting. But Moses sees clearly; who can tell
God what to do? Moses, then, wished that all God's people had his
Spirit, so all could share his intimacy and be his instruments

appoints seventy elders of the people to help.<BR><BR>However, once
these people are appointed, and the spirit is laid upon them, there
is talk that two men who are not authorized to prophesy begin to do
so. A young man breathlessly says to Moses, &ldquo;Eldad and Medad

those who are outside of the leadership? Do they listen to ideas? Do
they bring ideas on their own? How are people&rsquo;s thoughts shared

writes: &ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Although
James opens like a letter, it is an exhortation to ethical conduct.
Christians find themselves in an alien world, full of immorality and
evil; they are called to a faith that is not merely theoretical or
abstract, but acted upon, in every aspect of their lives. In a
situation where trials and tribulations abound, and where the poor
suffer at the hands of the rich, the author exhorts them to joy,
endurance, wisdom, confident prayer and faithful response to the
liberating word of God, as they await the second coming of the Lord.
The recipients appear to be a group of Jewish-Christian communities
outside Palestine. Traditionally, the Church has seen the author of
this book as James, the brother of our Lord; however, its excellent
Greek style, late acceptance into the canon, and absence of concerns
about ritual purity suggest another author. The author seems to have
written in the name of James, thus giving the book authority.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT COLOR="#800000">The
author has told his readers that what they pray for they will
receive, unless they ask with wrong motives. Now, in his conclusion
to the book (probably a sermon), he treats prayer more extensively.
Whether you </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT COLOR="#800000">suffer</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">or are &ldquo;cheerful&rdquo; &ndash;

call upon those in official positions in the church (&ldquo;elders&rdquo;,
v. 14) to &ldquo;pray over them&rdquo; and anoint them. (While &ldquo;oil&rdquo;
was thought to have medicinal value, here anointing is &ldquo;in the
name of the Lord&rdquo;, so it symbolizes Christ&rsquo;s healing
presence and power.) This prayer made in faith will restore health
(&ldquo;save the sick&rdquo;, v. 15) &ndash; as when Jesus </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT COLOR="#800000">raised
up</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">a
boy who seems to have been epileptic. Anointing with prayer will also
restore to spiritual health any who have intentionally deviated from
God&rsquo;s ways. Sins should be mutually confessed, to attain
integrity with God (&ldquo;righteous&rdquo;, v. 16); &ldquo;pray for
one another&rdquo;. Prayer is &ldquo;powerful and effective&rdquo;.
The prayer of &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; (v. 17) is an example of effective
prayer. Then vv. 19-20: if anyone strays from integrity with God

has been a difficult book for those of us wary of &ldquo;good works.&rdquo;
But at the end of the epistle, he gives some good advice. James sums
up how a community is to work together. He says, &ldquo;Pray for one
another. Lay hands on one another. Confess your sins to one another.
Pray for healing to come to one another.&rdquo;<BR><BR>In looking at
the texts from Mark and Numbers, James is a good finishing touch. For
James shows what happens when people are not so concerned about their
own importance or their own place in the power structure. James does
not focus on the problems of leadership. Instead, the end of this
epistle centers on community. When a community is working together,
praying together, building one another up, who is the &ldquo;most
powerful&rdquo; is not as big of an issue. Rather than focusing on
where they fit, they instead look at each other. They pray for one
another. They help one another. And if someone wanders away, others
are called upon to bring that person back to the truth.<BR><BR>Leadership
can be difficult. There are always people who will try and undermine
leadership. There are always people who work outside the &ldquo;accepted&rdquo;
way. But in following Jesus, the emphasis is to be on Jesus and on
the other &ndash; not on one&rsquo;s own power and definitely not on
one&rsquo;s own territory. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

writes: &ldquo;As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death
became old and died, the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition
has it that Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered.
This book stresses the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to
understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels were
written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I>

disciples were scandalized by an outsider curing in Jesus' name. To
the Jew of Jesus' time, a name revealed the power and purpose of the
person; to invoke the name of Jesus meant to tap into his healing
power. But use of the name had a price; to use a name meant the one
invoking it had a relationship to the person, the power, and the
movement the name represented. On these grounds, John objects to the
outsider healing in Jesus' name. John's question seems to say: &quot;How
dare he! This outsider should be one of us!&quot; [38]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Jesus turned the objection to the question
of discipleship. No matter how small the kind act, no one who did
good in the name of Jesus should be stopped. In fact, anyone who did
not oppose Jesus and his movement were considered potential friends
and benefactors. (This outward world view allowed Christianity to
grow rapidly. Anyone was a potential Christian.) Friendship began
with a simple kindness. A benefactor relationship began with a single
act of charity. The good others did for Christ and his followers did
matter!</FONT></P>

concern, it deserved a great punishment (to make the point Jesus

ones&quot; can be either the faithful or traveling missionaries.
Scandal among the congregation or the leadership caused dissension,
discord, and disunity. It could destroy the Church to a far greater
extent than any outsider.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">In v. 43, 45, and 47, Jesus used extreme
language to make his point about the choice between the Kingdom and
Gehanna. For the Jew in Jesus' time, the hand and the foot
represented the areas of human activity. Did the activity of the
disciple represent Christ or selfishness and evil influence? It was
better not to be involved in a certain activity (have hands and feet
&quot;cut off&quot;) than to scandalize and be condemned.</FONT></P>

Today I saw a man on a street corner holding a huge yellow sign that
read, &ldquo;You are saved only through Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
Personally, I&rsquo;m skeptical that his holding the sign during rush
hour is going to make much difference. I could, though, be reacting
like the disciples did. What is your reaction to a person holding
this kind of sign? How do you perceive his actions? Is he acting in a
leadership role? Is he like the man in Mark doing miracles in Jesus&rsquo;
name but not following the disciples? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

You hear that a church of another denomination (or no denomination)
is having phenomenal attendance every Sunday. What is your first
reaction? Are you glad that so many people are hearing the good news
or are you suspicious because they are not one of your own &ldquo;kind?&rdquo;
What is your gut reaction? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

disciples have argued over who of them is the greatest. Jesus has
told them not to seek position or prestige. Now he rebukes them for
attempting to stop an exorcist curing in his name. Jesus explains his
tolerance (v. 39): such a person will be slow to speak ill of him.
God does work through those who are not followers of Jesus. V. 40
generalizes this, in the form of a proverb. The &ldquo;reward&rdquo;
(v. 41) is entry into the Kingdom and the blessed state of union with
God awaiting us there. Those who treat Jesus&rsquo; followers with
kindness will be so rewarded.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

(&ldquo;stumbling block&rdquo;, v. 42) in the way of immature
Christians (&ldquo;little ones&rdquo;), causing them to sin, will
lead to condemnation on Judgement Day. (The &ldquo;great millstone&rdquo;
was drawn by a donkey in grinding wheat; &ldquo;the sea&rdquo; was
the place of chaos.) Vv. 43-47 speak of actions by members of the
community, the body. Anyone who shakes the faith of others (&ldquo;causes
you to stumble&rdquo;), however he or she does it, should be cast
out, for the sake of the community. Hell was seen as the place of
