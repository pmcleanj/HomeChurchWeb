<b>Jeremiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born or began his ministry 
in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded Assyria as the dominant 
power in the Middle East. He was a witness to the return to worship of the 
Lord (instituted by the Judean king Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death 
in battle in 609), the return of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon 
captured Jerusalem in 587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be 
a prophet to Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political 
and religious convulsions.

<strong>Jeremiah 23:1-6</strong>
<p>In Chapters <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+21-22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21-22</a>,
Jeremiah has made prophecies about four of the five last kings of
Judah. Three of these he considers bad, for siding with foreigners.
Rather than predicting the fate of the last one, Zedekiah, God now
speaks (through Jeremiah) about an ideal future king. God blames
Judah&#8217;s kings (&#8220;shepherds&#8221;) for scattering his &#8220;sheep&#8221;; they will be
punished &#8220;for your evil doings&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+23%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). But God will bring the people 
together again, to perfect safety, and will set good kings (&#8220;shepherds&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+23%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) over them. Their state will be 
as God originally intended: in the first creation story, God commanded humans to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+23%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>). God makes a formal 
pronouncement &#8220;the days are surely coming&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+23%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>) when God will &#8220;raise 
up&#8221; a godly &#8220;Branch&#8221; (shoot, descendant) of David&#8217;s line who will be wise, just and godly, ruling over both &#8220;Judah&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+23%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) and &#8220;Israel&#8221;. 
(Zedekiah is alluded to in a wordplay, the Hebrew for &#8220;righteousness&#8221; being <em>tzidkenu</em>.)
Later prophets, in dark times of unfaithful kings, recalled this ideal
rule and promised its realization in the future. This led to expecting
a new era, when God would himself rule the faithful.</p>

<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Three gospels in the New Testament offer similar portraits of the life of Jesus; 
Luke is the third of them. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied
Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), 
a collection of sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a 
gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, 
sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke 
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily 
for Gentiles.

<strong>Luke 1:68-79</strong>
<p>Zechariah has been struck mute upon hearing that his wife Elizabeth
will bear a child in old age. Later, she has given birth to a son, and
his parents have brought him to be circumcised and named. Elizabeth has
favoured the name John, and Zechariah has agreed. Now Zechariah &#8220;filled
with the Holy Spirit ... spoke this prophecy&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+1%3A67" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">67</a>), known as the <em>Benedictus</em>

tell of the blessing Israel&#8217;s God brings to &#8220;his people&#8221;: the Jews are
the elect. (While the verbs in translations are in the past tense, the
present is equally appropriate. The tense in Greek shows that they
describe how God characteristically acts and what he is inaugurating in
Jesus.) God gives them one who will save them from sin (&#8220;mighty
saviour&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+1%3A69" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">69</a>), descended from David, in 
fulfilment of prophecies he made through the Old Testament &#8220;prophets&#8221; (v.

is John the Baptist. He will be thought to be Elijah, &#8220;the prophet ...&#8221;
(although Luke sees the prophet long expected as Jesus). John&#8217;s mission
will be to bring people to an ethical, godly, way of living, thus
preparing the way for &#8220;the Lord&#8221;. Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+1%3A78-79" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">78-79</a>
return to Jesus&#8217; role: he will be the &#8220;dawn&#8221; (new light) from heaven,
the one through whom God fulfills his purpose for humanity. At a time
when hopes are at low ebb and people are particularly in need, he will
be a beacon guiding them into &#8220;peace&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+1%3A79" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">79</a>), i.e. wholeness, harmony,

<b>Colossians</b>
</small><p>
<small>Colossae was a city in what is now southwestern Turkey. It had a flourishing wool and 
textile industry and a significant Jewish population. It seems that most Christians there 
were Gentile. Although long thought to be written by Paul, today this epistle is considered 
non-Pauline for a number of reasons. The most compelling is that it emphasizes what God 
has already done for his people: Paul tells us what God is going to do in the future 
(although some argue that Paul shifted his viewpoint in later life.) It gives descriptions 
of false teachings which were being promulgated in the churches. Some scholars consider 
this evidence of later authorship. In the ancient world, writing in the name of a respected 
author was accepted and regarded as an honour.

<strong>Luke 23:33-43</strong>
<p>Jesus has been betrayed, arrested mocked, beaten, sentenced to
death. He, Simon of Cyrene (carrying the crossbar), two criminals and a
few police have walked to Calvary, &#8220;the place that is called The Skull&#8221;

to be deprived of one&#8217;s clothing was to lose one&#8217;s identity. (Biblical
