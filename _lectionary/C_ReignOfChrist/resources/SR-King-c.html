						<p class="bluetext"><b>11c
With joy, 12 (you should be) giving thanks to the Father, the One
having made you (worthy) enough (to have) a portion of the lot of the
saints in light. 13 (God is the one) who delivered us from the
authority of darkness and transferred (us) into the Kingdom of his
beloved SON, 14 in whom we have redemption, the pardon of sins. 15
(Jesus is the one) who is the image of the unseen God, firstborn of all
creation, 16 because in HIM everything was created, (all) in heaven and
on the earth, seen and unseen, whether thrones or dominions or rulers
or authorities; everything was created through HIM and in HIM. 17 HE is
before everything and everything stands together in HIM, 18 and HE is
the head of the Body, the Church. (HE is the one) who is the firstborn
from the dead, so that HE might be in everything, being first, 19
because in HIM, all fullness is pleased to reside, 20 and through HIM,
to reconcile everything in HIM, having made peace through the blood of
HIS cross, [through HIM] whether on the earth or in heaven.</b></p>
						<p class="indent">11c-20 Grammatically, this is one continuous sentence. However, textual scholars have divided into sub-sentences for clarity.</p>
						<p class="indent">1:15
&#8220;(Jesus is the one) who is the image of the unseen God&#8221; The image of
God reflected the language of Genesis 1:26 when people were created.
But, rising from the dead, Jesus became the new image for God.</p>
						<p class="indent">1:18
&#8220;(HE is the one) who is the firstborn from the dead, so that HE might
be in everything, being first.&#8221; Because Christ is the first to rise
from the dead, he is the preeminent One in the order of the new
creation, the Kingdom.</p>
						<p class="indent">1:19 &#8220;because in
HIM, all fullness is pleased to reside&#8221; The term &#8220;fullness&#8221; makes this
clause opaque. The fullness could be all creation, the presence of the
divine, or divine activity. In context, fullness seems to mean presence
(please to reside) and activity (please to reconcile) of God.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
these verses from Colossians, the author (Paul or a follower writing
just after the death of the apostle) used liturgical language to
describe the Messiah and his mission. First, as part of the epistle&#8217;s
intercession, the author encouraged the assembly at Colossae to give
thanks (&#8220;eucharisteo&#8221; in Greek) that they share in the lot given to the
saint in light (opposed to the darkness of Satan). He reminded them
they were &#8220;transferred&#8221; from darkness into the Kingdom (through
baptism) with the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Next,
the author wove a hymn of the Christ into the letter. This hymn honored
the Messiah as the image of the new creation (hence the new Adam) and
as the instrument of creation. As the instrument, he stood over all
other heavenly powers. Indeed, he was the reason for creation; all
things were made for the Christ. Since sin broke the relationship
between God and creation, the Christ would restore all things in
himself for his Father. In other words, his sacrifice on the cross (the
shedding of his Blood that was shared in worship) would reconcile
creation back with God. How could this happen? The opaque &#8220;because in
HIM, all fullness is pleased to reside&#8221; gives us the answer. As the
note above states, the fullness was the divine presence and activity.
The Christ reconciled all to the Father, because he was divine and
human.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The flow of the verses sealed the
tone as liturgical. The assembly praised the Christ who was the
instrument of creation and salvation. They celebrated his mission in
their initiation rites (baptism) and worship (Eucharist). When they
joined the assembly of believers, they were taken from the dark into
the light. When they gave thanks, they joined the holy ones who were in
the presence of that divine light. In other words, they partook in the
mystery that the Christ hymn described. They were one with He who
created and reconciled the cosmos to God the Father.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Do
we realize the overwhelming relationship we have with Christ when we
meet on Sundays? In worship, do we reflect on the grace we share with
others? The author of Colossians reminds us of the vision we should
have at Mass. We are part of something much greater than ourselves!</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>Reflect on Christ and your relationship to you. How is he King of your life? How is he King of the cosmos?</i></p>
