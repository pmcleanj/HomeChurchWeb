      <h2>Christ the King?</h2>
We all know what kings and queens are like.&nbsp; Just ask any kid and
you will get many of the same answers.&nbsp; A king has lots of money
and gold.&nbsp; A king can tell anyone to do whatever he wants them to
do.&nbsp; A king wears a crown.&nbsp; A king has a big kingdom and lots
of soldiers.&nbsp; And the number one answer is that a king always
lives in a big castle.&nbsp; We all know about what kings are supposed
to look like.&nbsp; Yet, on the last Sunday of the Church year we
celebrate Christ our King.&nbsp; Jesus looks like a very different kind
of king that the picture that any kid will paint for you.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Jesus hangs on a cross, bloody and defeated.&nbsp; The only similarity
he has to the description of what we all know a king is supposed to
look like is that he has a crown on his head, but this crown is a crown
of thorns not of gold and jewels.&nbsp; A sign is above his head which
says &#8220;The King of the Jews,&#8221; but all who see Jesus hanging on the cross
know that this man is no king.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Jesus is far from the kind of king, from the kind of Messiah that the
Jewish people were expecting.&nbsp; The Jews knew that there was a
Messiah coming, one who would come to save them.&nbsp; They knew that
this Messiah would be one from the line of King David. He would be the
one to come and free them from the oppression that they were
experiencing under the Roman occupation of their promised land,
Israel.&nbsp; This King would rise up and be a REAL king who would come
with power and might and save them.&nbsp; This Jesus who was hanging on
the cross was not the king that they had expected.&nbsp; He was
powerless, dying on a cross.&nbsp; How could he save anyone, he could
not even save himself?&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We often hear the same cries about God today.&nbsp; Why did God not
heal my mother?&nbsp; How come God let so many hurricanes hit Florida,
haven&#8217;t they had enough?&nbsp; How come God doesn&#8217;t make us all get
along so that there is no more war?&nbsp; Today God seems to lack the
power to save us, as well.&nbsp; There is still sickness, poverty, and
injustice.&nbsp; It seems that evil still wins the day.&nbsp; We want a
God who will come with power to make the world right.&nbsp; Just like
the Jewish people of Jesus&#8217; time wanted a Messiah to come in power and
save them from Roman occupation.&nbsp; We celebrate Christ the King
this Sunday, yet Jesus looks far from regal.&nbsp; We wonder, what kind
of king is this Jesus anyway?<br>
<br>
      <br>

      </h4>The
soldiers, leaders, and even the criminal on the cross taunt
Jesus.&nbsp; They cry out to him, &#8220;He saved others, let him save
himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one,&#8221; or &#8220;If you are
the king of the Jews, save yourself, &#8220; or &#8220;Are you not the Messiah,
save yourself and us.&#8221;&nbsp; There is the cry again and again, that if
Jesus is truly the Messiah, truly a king then he should show his power
and save himself.&nbsp; He should come down off the cross and prove he
is the Messiah, the chosen one of God to all the world.&nbsp; This is
the kind of king that the people expect, a king who comes in power and
might, a king who would show the world that he is truly the King of the
Jews.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In the movie and the book the <i>Last Temptation of Christ</i>, the
last temptation is just this, to come down off the cross.&nbsp; Jesus
is tempted to save himself.&nbsp; The movie then goes on to show what
Jesus&#8217; life would have been like if he had come down off the cross and
saved himself.&nbsp; Many years after Jesus came down from the cross
this Jesus encounters Paul.&nbsp; Paul is preaching on the streets,
preaching Christ crucified, preaching about the death and resurrection
of Jesus.&nbsp; Jesus tries to confront Paul and tell him that no, he
did not die on the cross.&nbsp; Instead he came down off the
cross.&nbsp; Paul responds saying essentially, &#8220;No that kind of Messiah
who comes down from the cross to save himself does not save us.&nbsp;
Instead the only hope is the resurrected Jesus.&nbsp; The resurrected
Jesus saves the world.&#8221;&nbsp; Right there, that is the crux of it
all.&nbsp; The only way that we are saved is through Jesus death on a
cross.&nbsp; The cries of the people are to save himself to prove he is
a king, and yet by staying on the cross Jesus is doing just that.&nbsp;
Just when Jesus looks least like a king through the world&#8217;s standards
he is acting most kingly.&nbsp; A king is not one who saves himself but
saves others.&nbsp; He cannot save himself if he is to save
others.&nbsp; So he dies on a cross that we can be saved.&nbsp; He is a
Messiah, a king, who saves others by not saving himself.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The second criminal gets this and asks Jesus, &#8220;Remember me when you
come into your kingdom.&#8221;&nbsp; To which Jesus responds &#8220;Truly, I tell
you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus hanging there
dying of a cross between two criminals and he is offering paradise, the
kingdom of God, and forgiveness of sins to a criminal, one of the ones
who is most in need.&nbsp; Jesus truly is Christ our King.&nbsp; It is
in this picture of Jesus that we see what kind of a king we truly
have.&nbsp; We have a king who comes to save us and who gives his life
and then rises again so that our sins are forgiven and we may be saved.<br>

<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>The king of Judah during the time of the prophet Jeremiah was not
following in the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; He was the shepherd who led
the flocks, the chosen people of God astray.&nbsp; Because of his
actions the people of God would be taken from their land into
exile.&nbsp; At the time of these verses from Jeremiah, the people are
in despair.&nbsp; They are being taken from their homes and shipped off
to foreign lands.&nbsp; They feel abandoned and deserted by God.&nbsp;
They are hopeless.&nbsp; Jeremiah the prophet has a word from God for
the people.&nbsp; He tells them that all is not lost, God will
act.&nbsp; It is only through the Lord&#8217;s intervention that the people
of God will be saved.&nbsp; The Lord says, &#8220;I myself will gather the
remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and
I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and
multiply (v. 3).&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Eventually God does keep this promise and after 70 years in exile the
people come back to the promised land.&nbsp; But this is not all that
God promises. The Lord says, &#8220;The days are surely coming when I will
raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and
deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land
(v. 5).&#8221;&nbsp; It is because of these words and others like them that
the Jewish people waited for the earthly king to come and rule
again.&nbsp; We see that this was fulfilled in Jesus, but in an
unexpected way.&nbsp; Instead of coming in power to rule, Jesus came to
seek and to save the lost, to heal the sick and save the sinner.&nbsp;
Jesus came in weakness, suffered and died. But that was not the end of
the story &#8230;<br>

</h4>Jesus rose again.&nbsp; In his resurrection he overcame all the
powers of sin, death, and the devil.&nbsp; Our lesson from Colossians
shares with us that through the death and resurrection of Jesus &#8220;God
has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the
kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness
of sins (v.13-14).&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus is truly the king and has brought us
into his kingdom through the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp; Just as Jesus
forgave the thief on the cross and brought the thief into paradise with
him, it is through Jesus&#8217; forgiveness of our sins through his death on
the cross that we are brought into paradise.&nbsp; The king has come to
rescue us and that rescue can only come, through staying on the cross
and dying for us.&nbsp; That it was through the blood of the cross that
we have peace with God.&nbsp; Colossians tells us that &#8220;through him God
was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in
heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&#8221;&nbsp; Through
the blood, the king dying of the cross, we are forgiven and at peace
with the Lord.&nbsp; Jesus truly is Christ our King.<br>

      <ol>
        <li>How do you envision a king?&nbsp; <br>
</li><li>As we look at the world around us we see that the world is far
from perfect.&nbsp; How does Jesus death and resurrection speak to a
world which is still in pain?&nbsp; Is our God a powerless God? <br>
        </li>
        <li>Many struggle with the Son of God dying of a cross.&nbsp;
It doesn&#8217;t make sense.&nbsp; How do you share with those who struggle
about why God would send his Son to die for us?</li>
        <li>In what ways has the suffering of God touched your
life?&nbsp; How would it be different if God had come in power instead
of in weakness?<br>
