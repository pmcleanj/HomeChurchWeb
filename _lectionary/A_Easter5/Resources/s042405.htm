We all share the desire to find our way home, whether it&#8217;s at the end of a long 
day or at the end of a long journey, a long time of wandering, of alienation, 
of homesickness and pain. That may be why so many people speak of finding a church 
&#8220;home&#8221; when they find a congregation that welcomes them and feels like a place 
in which they can grow their faith. Of course, if a church only makes us comfortable 
with our lives as they are, our presuppositions and our compromises in faith, 
then perhaps we are speaking of accommodation rather than challenge and growth. 
Nevertheless, for many people, finding a church home means finding a safe haven, 
a refuge, a fortress, and a rock. The church may be the one way that they experience 
God&#8217;s protective love in a hostile and dangerous world. <br>
<br>
It&#8217;s in that safe haven that we receive, like little babies, the spiritual milk 
that we need to grow our faith. We ourselves become part of the very &#8220;structure,&#8221; 
the home, the spiritual house that First Peter speaks of. If we remember that 
his audience was a group of dispossessed people, people who had no unifying dignity 
and identity apart from being a church, the power of these words expands in our 
hearing. Can you imagine being &#8220;no people&#8221; and then becoming &#8220;God&#8217;s people&#8221;? Have 
you ever felt like a &#8220;nobody&#8221; and then a &#8220;somebody&#8221;? Have you ever felt outside 
and alone, and then part of something greater than yourself? What would it sound 
like to your ears, if you thought you were &#8220;nobody,&#8221; and then became part of a 
&#8220;chosen race,&#8221; and words like &#8220;holy&#8221; and &#8220;royal&#8221; were used to describe you? What 
would it feel like to come out of darkness into the &#8220;marvelous light&#8221; of God? 
<br>
<br>
The Acts reading recounts the violent reaction to Stephen&#8217;s sermon. Stephen was 
supposed to be serving tables (the hospitality committee?) but he got it into 
his heart and mind and spirit that he needed to climb into the pulpit and preach. 
When he re-told the story of his people and reminded them of their tendency to 
ignore the prophets, including Jesus, they turned on him and killed him, while 
Saul, the future martyr and apostle, watched their cloaks. This short passage 
reminds us of various moments in the life of Jesus, from the Transfiguration (he 
must have looked radiant when he saw the heavens open) to the Baptism of Jesus 
(again, the skies opening), the surrender of his spirit and the forgiveness for 
those who did not know what they were doing. <br>
<br>
Somehow, Stephen&#8217;s sermon did not go over as well as Peter&#8217;s had, on Pentecost. 
Our witness is better received in some times and places than in others, and falls 
on more hospitable ears. We may have no way of knowing the results of what we 
do and say, and some days are better than others in the life of the church. <br>
<br>
Stephen&#8217;s sermon spoke of the foundations of faith that had been laid down long 
ago, strong foundations, deep roots, powerful witnesses and lives to remember. 
The people&#8217;s shared experience, their walk, with God, including the times they 
failed to listen to and heed the <i><b>still-speaking God,</b></i> provided stones 
sunk deep into their collective religious memory. First Peter, though, calls the 
people &#8220;living stones&#8221; and refers to a precious cornerstone, again, addressing 
those who must have felt that they had been nobodies in a hostile world and needed 
a safe and welcoming place, a home. In the Gospel of John, Jesus uses the language 
of place, too, when he promises to prepare a dwelling place for his followers, 
who were bound to encounter the opposition and loneliness experienced by the dispossessed 
in First Peter and the martyrs in the Book of Acts. <br>
<br>
And so, today, people of all kinds find their way to our churches. How is your 
church a safe haven, a refuge, a place of dignity and identity for those who seek 
a church home? What beliefs, stories, sufferings, and joys are sunk deep into 
the foundations of your church&#8217;s shared experience? In what ways does the <i><b>still-speaking 
God</b></i> call your church to become more welcoming and more energetic in conveying 
and embodying that welcome? We have it backwards if our desire to welcome people 
is in order to increase our membership: welcoming is who we are and have always 
been: &#8220;Because of its peculiar faith and its identity formed in hurt, the church 
is a unified community capable of a risking hospitality.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not our church, 
or our home, that we open to others: &#8220;The householder, God, has sole authority 
over admission at the doorway&#8221; (Brueggemann et al, Texts for Preaching, Year A). 
<br>
<br>
How deep is our conviction that we somehow &#8220;own&#8221; the church, that it &#8220;belongs&#8221; 
to us in some way? Would it offend or change or affect us and our behavior if 
we truly embraced the belief that God is the householder in this &#8220;church home,&#8221; 
not us? What is &#8220;the hurt&#8221; that formed our identity? <br>
<br>
Another thing to consider is our identity in a world that often blurs into our 
life &#8211; the world of materialism and success and growth and prosperity is awfully 
easy to emulate in the life of the church. Do we try to imitate the methods and 
tactics of the world around us when we take on the challenges of church life, 
or do we seek other sources of wisdom and strength? What are the boundaries that 
define us? How does the word &#8220;boundary&#8221; strike us when we talk about the church? 
<br>
<br>
&#8220;The Christian community in North America has so bought into the world&#8217;s economics, 
its psychology, its standards of morality that visitors from outer space would 
have a difficult time discerning the difference between the social and political 
culture of the day, with its civil religion, and the church.&#8221; (Brueggemann et 
al, Texts for Preaching, Year A) <br>
<br>
What makes us a distinctive people? Could a visitor tell the difference between 
your church and the surrounding culture? In what ways? In what ways might the 
surrounding culture have valuable gifts and support for our life in the church? 
In what ways do we &#8211; must we &#8211; stand apart and declare ourselves different? When 
have you experienced the church as &#8220;the headlights&#8221; and when has it been &#8220;the 
tail lights&#8221; in the journey toward justice and righteousness? In other words, 
when has the surrounding culture led the way and the church, ironically, had to 
catch up? (One might think of the ordination of women.) How has the <i><b>still-speaking 
God,</b></i> at times, spoken to the church through outsiders? (Think of the ancient 
example of Ruth, the Moabite widow, speaking to Naomi.) <br>
<br>
How do you and your congregation experience the <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i> 
today as a refuge, a rock, a fortress? What is the call that, like Stephen, you 
hear that makes you preach? Is it ironic that, in these readings, &#8220;stones&#8221; can 
build but they can also kill? Who really lived and who really died in the story 
of Stephen? Where is life, and where is death? <br>
<br>
One commentary (The Cultural World of Jesus, by John Pilch) turns to John Dominic 
Crossan&#8217;s translation of the familiar &#8220;I am the way&#8230;&#8221; verse from John: &#8220;I am the 
authentic (truth) vision (way) of existence (life).&#8221; Pilch says: &#8220;Jesus&#8217; words 
and deeds in this Gospel speak love at every turn. He demonstrates absolute, total, 
and universal love in his varied responses to those who approach him. Jesus&#8217; life, 
teaching, and behavior do indeed present people with &#8216;an authentic vision of human 
existence,&#8217; that is, a model of the way human life ought to be lived. If one lives 
like this, one will definitely encounter God, who is Love.&#8221; This was a reassuring 
message to the early Jewish Christians, who could have experienced great anxiety 
over losing their spiritual home (the synagogue) because of their belief in Jesus. 
How is it a consoling message to members of your church, and the wider church, 
today?

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Fifth Sunday of Easter <br>
April 24, 2005 <br>
Acts 7:55-60 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> DOSHISHA 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">With its 1,400 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines, the ancient city of 
Kyoto is a tranquil oasis in the midst of the noise and tumult of modern Japan. 
The tree-shaded campus of Doshisha University in Kyoto, too, provides quiet corners 
for meditation and reflection. But Doshisha, which was founded by Christians more 
than a century ago, has not turned its back on the contemporary world. Its curriculum 
seeks to instill both the knowledge and the moral values necessary to the challenges 
of the 21st century. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Martha Mensendiek, a United Church of Christ missionary who teaches Social 
Work at Doshisha, embraces that vision not only in the classroom, but also as 
advisor to the Habitat for Humanity chapter on campus. A few years ago, she led 
eight of her students on the chapter&#8217;s first project: to build a duplex in Bacolod, 
in the Negros Occidental region of the Philippines. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Even as she shared in their hard work of mixing cement by shovel, Martha watched 
her students change right before her eyes. Most had never worked in construction, 
let alone visited a developing country where poverty and misery are commonplace. 
&#8220;But that did not stop them from enjoying themselves,&#8221; Martha recalls. &#8220;Working 
together with the Filipinos we sang songs and had fun communicating across language 
barriers as we worked.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Their Filipino hosts&#8217; broad smiles and deep Christian faith proved infectious. 
Each day began with a period of devotions. Although none of the Japanese students 
was a Christian, all joined in singing the hymns their Filipino friends taught 
them. &#8220;It was wonderful to witness the Spirit at work bringing students in touch 
with the joy of Christian community,&#8221; Martha Mensendiek says. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">&#8220;This trip opened many doors for many people,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;It opened the 
physical &#8216;door&#8217; for two families who moved out of the slums into a decent house. 
It opened many hearts to friendships across boundaries and to the joy of volunteer 
work and community building.&#8221; And it opened the door to many more mission trips 
with many more students. &#8220;I feel truly blessed to be given a part in this kind 
of ministry,&#8221;Martha says. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">All of us in the United Church of Christ are blessed by international partnerships 
such as we have through Martha Mensendiek with Doshisha University.

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->
</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one 
psalm at each Sunday service, in this order: 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative 
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
