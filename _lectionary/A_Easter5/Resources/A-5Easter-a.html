</div>
<h4>Do We Really Know Jesus?</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Have you ever seen something, but were unaware of its importance until later?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Familiarity breeds dullness. Comfortable in our own
surroundings, we can take people and events for granted. We concentrate
on the foibles of family and friends. Because we think we know them so
well, we are blinded to the talents and possibilities they possess.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Like family and friends, familiarity can dull our
faith relationship with Jesus. In the John's gospel, Jesus took this
problem head on. He shook the faith of his followers so they could see
the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Jesus told his followers</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">1 "Don't worry! Trust
God. And trust me. 2 There are many rooms where my Father lives. And,
I'm going to prepare a place for you there. If this weren't true, why
would I tell you so? 3 After I go and prepare your places, I'll
certainly come and take you back with me. Then, you and I will always
be together. 4 So, you know the way where I'm going."</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>5 Thomas told Jesus, "Lord, we don't know where you're going! How are we supposed to know the way?"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">6 "I am the way to the
Father, his truth, and his very life!" Jesus replied. "No one can come
to the Father except through me. 7 You've know me a while. Now you know
and have seen the Father!"</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>8 Then, Phillip said, "Lord! Show us the Father. That will be enough for us."</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">9 "I've been with you a long time,"</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#ee0000">"And
you haven't got to know me, Phillip? The person who has really seen me
has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father?' 10 Don't
you believe I am in the Father and the Father is in me?"</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Then Jesus told his followers: <font color="#ee0000">"These
aren't my words. The Father is in me, doing his work. 11 Trust me! I am
in the Father and the Father is in me. If you don't believe that, then
put your trust in the things I do. 12 Listen! The person who trusts me
will do things I do. He will do even greater things! Why? Because I'm
going to the Father."</font></b></p>
<p class="bodytext">John's passages can be divided into two sections:
1) the revelation of Jesus as the way to the Father and 2) the promise
to the disciples they would show others the face of the Father in the
works they performed.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Jesus said to his disciples:</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b><font color="#ee0000">1 "Do not let your
heart(s) be troubled. Believe in God and believe in ME. 2 In my
Father's house, there are many rooms (reserved for you). But if not,
(would) I tell you (this) since I go to prepare a place for you? 3 And,
since I would go and I would prepare a place for you, I will come back
again and I will take you with ME, so where I am, you might also be
(with me). 4 Where I go, you know the way."</font> 5 Thomas said to him, "LORD, we do not know where YOU go. How are we to know the way?" 6 JESUS said to him, <font color="#ee0000">"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through ME."</font></b></p>
<p class="indent">14:1 "Believe in God and believe in me." The two
verbs in this sentence can be translated either as a command
("believe") or as a statement of fact ("you believe") that implied
familiarity. So, the sentence can say: "You believe in God and you
believe in me." Or, the two senses can be combined, as in: "You believe
in God. Now, believe in me!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">These passages fall within the last discourse Jesus
had with disciples before his passion. After Judas left, Peter promised
that he would die with Jesus if necessary. Jesus responded with a
prophecy about Peter's apostasy (see John 13:36-38).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, Jesus launched into the relationship between
anxiety and true faith [14:1]. Trust reduces worry (literally "hearts
troubled.") But, what was the end game of trust? In other words, what
would God and Jesus ultimately do? They would prepare the Kingdom for
the followers of Jesus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As God dwells infinitely, so does his kingdom.
There are "many rooms" where one can stay in the Kingdom (a more
literal translation of 14:2). The analogy of rooms in the Father's
house, however, does not refer to space, but to relationship. The
Father's "house" is his extended family. Like Jesus, we are God's
children. And he invites all people into his family.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Before he could invite believers to enter the
Kingdom, Jesus must go before them to prepare the way. [14:3] The way
to the Kingdom was the cross. Throughout John's gospel, Jesus
foreshadowed and prophesied his death. And his death would bring new,
eternal life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even though his followers would walk the same road
of suffering as Jesus, he would return to travel with them as a
companion and bring them safely back to him. [14:4a] His return
referred to his immediate assistance through his Spirit and at the
Second Coming. In either case, Jesus returned to bring all the faithful
into an intimate relationship with him. His risen life would be their
risen life. [14:4b] To those who lived with Jesus and his community,
the way of suffering to glory seemed obvious. [14:4c].</p>
<p class="bodytext">Or, did it? Not to Thomas, at least. He didn't know
the way. [14:5] Here, Jesus opened with his famous line: "I am the way,
the truth, and the life." [14:6a] Much ink has been spilled over this
obtuse phrase, depending where the commentator placed his (or her)
emphasis. In context, we should place the emphasis on the "way." Jesus
was the means to Father. [14:6b] Unfortunately, the sentence has two
additional objects ("truth" and "life"). What was the relationship of
truth and life with Jesus as the way to the Father?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The key word in the Jesus' declaration was "truth."
"Truth" connected "way" and "life" as a modifier to either. In other
words, Jesus was the "true" (i.e., faithful) way to life with the
Father. Or, Jesus was the way to "true" life (i.e., a life with meaning
and purpose only God could give: eternal life). In this way, "truth"
bridged "way" and "life."</p>
<p class="bodytext">But, Jesus implied more in his declaration: "I
AM...the TRUTH..." For a moment, suspend any modern notion of truth as
a relationship between the person and the facts, or a consistent
relationship between ideas. Equate the word "true" with "only." Then,
ask yourself: What is the only thing that is true, the only thing that
matters? Any other answer than "God" would be false. In this context,
the only true reality is God. Any existence away from God is false. In
this sense, one finds truth only in a relationship with God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Jesus said "I AM...the TRUTH...," he asserted
his divinity. The phrase "I AM..." echoed the name of God revealed to
Moses in Exodus 3:14-15. The "TRUTH" revealed the only reality that
mattered in the world. Any belief that detracted from Jesus was false.
Any choice away from a life as a follower was a false choice. For the
Christian, Jesus was the "TRUTH" because he was God!</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, in the phrase, "I am the way, the truth, and
the life," Jesus declared he was the only means to the Father and he
was the very presence of God on earth. Christians professed an adage
that summed up the Jesus' phrase well: "Wherever God acts, God is." In
Jesus, God acts because God is.</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: True God and True Man (CCC 464-469)</p>
<p class="indent">As the apostles began to preach to a non-Jewish
audience, they entered a different cultural world. Where the official
myths had very little meaning. Where people thirsted for new, radically
different spiritualities. And, where people argued philosophy as daily
entertainment. This environment provided futile ground for
evangelization. Within several generations, "Jesus of Nazareth" was a
common household name in the urban areas of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="indent">People not only hungered for stories that told them
WHO Jesus was. They also asked WHAT Jesus was. How did Jesus reveal the
presence of God on earth? Was Jesus really a man? Something greater?
Or, something different?</p>
<p class="indent">Some called Jesus a heavenly messenger, who just
appeared to be a man. Others said Jesus was God by adoption, so he was
just a creature like other men. Still others affirmed Jesus was truly
God who became something new when he became a man; in this sense, Jesus
was superhuman. Along the same lines, others held Jesus was truly God
who took upon himself a human "shell;" Jesus had a real human body, but
his inner reality (mind, heart, will, spirit) were truly God. There
were so many opinions, the Church had to clarify the faith through the
declaration of dogma.</p>
<p class="indent">The Church holds that the Son of God is a person,
distinct and unique, just as we are individual persons, unique and
distinct from each other. This person possesses abilities to choose, to
love, to act, just as we do. However, the abilities of the Son of God
are limitless because he has a complete divine nature (he cannot be
partially God, for limiting the unlimited is a contradiction in terms).
With a divine nature, the Son of God is truly God.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Son of God was born into the world, he made
the deliberate choice to limit his abilities as a human person. This is
not a contradiction, for the limitations placed upon the unlimited were
not imposed by nature, but made by free choice. And the choice was
love. The Son of God took upon himself all the limitations of human
nature, so he could show the world the infinite depth of God's love.
God's Son became "Jesus of Nazareth" to reveal his love, to offer that
love, and invite humanity into a love relationship. For the sake of
love, Jesus of Nazareth was truly man.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How can we follow Jesus the Way? How can we proclaim Jesus as the Truth? How can we experience Jesus as the Life?</i></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b><font color="#ee0000">7 "Now (all of) you have known ME, you will know the Father. From now (on), (all of) you know him and have seen him."</font> 8 Philip said to HIM, "LORD, show us the Father and (that) will be enough for us." 9 JESUS said to him, <font color="#ee0000">"
I am with (all of) you for such a (long) time and you have not known
me, Philip? The (person) having seen ME has seen the Father. How can
you say, 'Show us the Father?' 10 Do you not believe, (Philip,) that I
am in the Father and the Father is in ME? The words which I spoke to
(all of) you I did not speak by myself; the Father remaining in me does
his works. 11 Believe me that the Father is in ME and I am in the
Father. But if not, believe because of these works. 12 Amen, amen, I
say to you (all). The (person) believing in ME will also do the works
that I do, and (even) greater than these he will do, because I go to
the Father."</font></b></p>
<p class="indent">14:7-12 The word "you" shifted from singular (Thomas
and Phillip) to plural (the followers), depending upon the context. The
Greek endings on the word "you" indicated that shift that might be
difficult to follow in English. For the sake of clarity, the plural was
indicated with the phrase "all of you" and "you all."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The followers of the Jesus knew him because they
lived with him, ate with him, argued with him. However, experience can
breed disbelief. [14:5, 8] They knew what Jesus did in the past. They
did not know what he could do in the future. At one point in time, he
would reveal the impossible, the very face of the Father.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Judaism built its spirituality upon the notion of
the unseen God. The God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob so transcended time
and space, was so unique and separate from earthly existence, no
picture or statue could capture the essence of YHWH. In fact, Jews
considered it an idolatry to even attempt such a feat. They believed
they would die if they ever saw the face of an all-powerful,
transcendent God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now the time had come. The moment was the
crucifixion. They saw the face of a loving Father in the self-giving of
his Son. That was the point of "...from now on,..." [14:7b] By gazing
upon the crucifixion in faith, the followers of Jesus saw the face of
the Father. They knew him. And, in that one scene, they knew the Father
was in Jesus and Jesus was in the Father. If they didn't see that fact,
then they really didn't know Jesus. [14:9-10]</p>
<p class="bodytext">The power of the Father through Jesus presented the
beginning for faith. [14:11b] The same power that flowed through Jesus
would flow through his followers. [14:12] One could see the results of
this power in great miracles and mighty deeds. But the power of the
Father resulted in something greater, the self-giving love of the
follower. In the love of the disciple, the world saw the face of the
Father and it could now see the intimate union of the Father and the
Son. [14:11a]</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: Why did the Word become flesh?</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus lived and died for one reason: to show everyone
the face of the Father. When he revealed his Father's face in the
crucifixion, Jesus invited everyone to a reconciliation with God, to a
love relationship with the Father, and to a sharing in God's very life.
In this way, Jesus shows us how to be holy, how to reveal the face of
the Father to others.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How can our simple acts of love invite others to see the face of the Father?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Familiarity can breed dullness. Experience can
breed disbelief. Or both can challenge us to look at others with fresh
eyes to see how much potential they have. Both can challenge us to seek
a personal change of heart, so that harden walls of our indifference
may give way to an ever-flowing love. Both can challenge us to show the
face of the Father in the small sacrifices we make each day.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us then do the kind of things Christ did. Die to self so others might love.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>What potential do others in life possess? How
can you help them to develop those talents? How can you show others
Christ in that effort? </i></p>
