<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 7:55-60</strong>
<p>As the community grew, the need for leaders in addition to the apostles was recognized

so seven were chosen to attend to social-service and administrative
functions (&#8220;daily distribution of food&#8221;), of whom Stephen, &#8220;a man full
of faith and the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+6%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6:5</a>), was one. He &#8220;did great 
wonders and signs among the people&#8221;

well. He foresaw that Jesus would &#8220;change the customs&#8221;

especially that the Temple would no longer be the centre of worship &#8211;
God can be worshipped anywhere. He has accused all Israel, both present
generations and past, of obstinate resistance to God&#8217;s commands; he has
stated that God repeatedly sent prophets to correct their ways, but
they rejected, persecuted (and murdered) these prophets &#8220;who foretold
the coming of the Righteous One&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+7%3A52" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:52</a>) &#8211; for which God punished 
them by ending the kingdoms of Israel and Judah and by exiling them. They have now betrayed and murdered &#8220;the Son of Man&#8221;

<p>Now he receives confirmation of his insights through a vision of
Jesus exalted at God&#8217;s &#8220;right hand&#8221;. But the mob purposely avoids
listening to him: they <em>cover their ears</em>

and pushed over a ledge, to be crushed and buried by heavy stones
hurled down upon them. &#8220;The witnesses&#8221; were legally required to cast
the first stones. Stephen&#8217;s words (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+7%3A59-60" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:59-60</a>) echo those of Jesus on

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 31:1-5,15-16</strong>
<p>Illness, persecution and separation from God were seen as allied concepts; all three involved <em>losing face</em>, &#8220;shame&#8221;. The psalmist prays that God, ultimate rectitude (&#8220;righteousness&#8221;) and reliability 
(&#8220;rock&#8221;, vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A2-3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2-3</a>, 
&#8220;fortress&#8221;), will show him his ways (or perhaps the psalmist recalls a past time.) He feels as though a &#8220;net&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) waits to ensnare him &#8211; 
either of death, or of his enemies. Jesus quoted v.

your care I commit my very being</em>:
an expression of supreme confidence. God has made the psalmist whole,
restored him to union with God. The psalmist protests his innocence (v.
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>): I deserve your protection, for 
I am loyal to you. God has restored him to stable life (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A7-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7-8</a>). He tells of his afflictions 
in vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A9-13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9-13</a>. In the ancient Near 
East, people believed that the milestones of life, especially birth and death, were in the hands of the god(s). In v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A15" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15a</a>, the psalmist acknowledges 
that his destiny depends on God. May God be present in him (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+31%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16a</a>);
may he restore him to godly living. The psalm ends with the psalmist
praising God for his love, for returning him to his favour, for
preservation of the faithful, and for punishment of evildoers.</p>

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<strong>1 Peter 2:2-10</strong>

for believers: </p>
<ls>
<li>as <em>living stones</em> making up God&#8217;s building, &#8220;spiritual house&#8221;, and </li>
<li>as a &#8220;priesthood&#8221; dedicated to God (&#8220;holy&#8221;) presenting lives of faith and love (&#8220;sacrifices&#8221;) to him on behalf of all humans.</li>

<p> Christ is <u>the</u> &#8220;living stone&#8221;, the cornerstone, the foundation of the <em>building</em>, the Church.</p>

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 14:1-14</strong>
<p>Judas Iscariot has left to do his dastardly deed. Jesus now prepares
his disciples for his departure. Belief in God includes belief in him

resurrection and ascension, to the Father, to prepare a place of permanent fellowship for them (vv.

there, a place where there is ample room (&#8220;many dwelling places&#8221;). Thomas is logical, and bewildered. Jesus is the <em>road map</em>, &#8220;the way&#8221; (v.

he is ultimate &#8220;truth&#8221; and the source of &#8220;life&#8221; itself. Access to God
is only through him. Being both God and human, to know him is to know
the Father. Knowing him, they are already getting to know the Father
and &#8220;have seen him&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+14%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) in Jesus.</p>

the Son. Father and Son are one and the same. A master entrusted his <em>agent</em>
to act on his behalf in every way. Jesus is the Father&#8217;s agent,
empowered to act completely for the Father. Jesus says, in essence, if
you do not <em>buy</em> 
this <em>mutual presence</em>, then trust in me on the basis of what I do: you are seeing the Father&#8217;s &#8220;works&#8221; (vv.
