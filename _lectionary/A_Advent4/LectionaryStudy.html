<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I><SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost.<BR><SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a
public example, was minded to put her away privily.<BR><SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in
her is of the Holy Ghost.<BR><SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she
shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he
shall save his people from their sins.<BR><SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet, saying,<BR><SUP>23</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold,
a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
us. </I>

7:10-16</A>,<BR></FONT></SPAN></I><FONT SIZE=3>Ahaz was the young
king of Judah facing the threat of the northern kingdom of Israel
allying with powerful Syria. His rule in danger, Ahaz was engaging in
political maneuvers for survival. Isaiah encouraged him to rely on
God, not on other nations, for strength. The king was hesitant even
to ask for a sign of God&rsquo;s favor. The prophet gave one anyway &mdash;
a young maiden&rsquo;s child whose name would be &quot;God with us.&quot;
Most likely, this statement refers to Hezekiah, son of the king&rsquo;s
wife, who would rule Judah, and would be a sign that God had not
forsaken his people. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The import of the sign, then, is less a prediction of
the virgin birth (the Hebrew words do not necessarily imply &quot;virgin&quot;
in the strict sense) but an affirmation that the sign of God&rsquo;s
care is already present. Ahaz need not look for special omens or
portents. We too can find the same advice meaningful in our lives:
look to the ordinary for the signs of God&rsquo;s saving presence. </FONT>

community at Rome was composed primarily of Jewish converts whose
families had migrated to Rome generations earlier. Paul had not yet
visited the city when he wrote this letter, nor had he been involved

apostle to non-Jews in particular by pointing to the mission he
shares with all apostles &mdash; to proclaim the Gospel. He also
expresses the link between the incarnation and the paschal mystery:
in Jesus, the Son of God became a man precisely to die and rise so

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Christian
tradition gives us several interpretations of the dilemma Joseph
faced when he discovered Mary&rsquo;s pregnancy. His uprightness
could be seen as devotion to Mary in not wanting to expose her to
shame and disgrace. It could also be interpreted as devotion to the
Jewish law in refusing to take a presumed adulteress as his wife.
Finally, this uprightness could be a direct act of humility before
God in hesitating to identify himself with what he perceived as the
work of the Holy Spirit.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P>We need not decide which of these interpretations is correct &mdash;
they all have some basis in tradition and some merit. However, if we
consider the ambiguities in Joseph&rsquo;s dilemma that are common to
all of these interpretations, we can find a mirror for our own
Christian response to God&rsquo;s presence in life. 
</P>
<P>The heart of the matter &mdash; the area where Joseph can be our
model &mdash; is his fidelity and openness to God&rsquo;s will within
an uncertain situation. The Gospel message is often presented as
bringing certainty to our questions and doubts, sometimes at the
price of oversimplifying and distorting its meaning and creating a
blind and false sense of security. Today&rsquo;s picture of Joseph
groping and struggling is a healthy corrective model.
