      Along
with being one of my favorite seasons, I find the season of Advent as
one of high stress.&nbsp; We live in a world where the great
communicator of the internet is causing us in reality to become more
and more isolated.&nbsp; Increasingly we are surrounded by four walls
as studies show we are spending more time at work and less at
home.&nbsp; And when we are home, we are doing more and more things
that are work related keeping us in the four walls of our house.&nbsp;
Our connection to the outside world is often relegated to what we read
and hear from the media, and we know that is inherently biased with
either a conservative or liberal spin.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Yes, many feel confined and disconnected in a world of
uncertainty.&nbsp; The business of this season, the sad remembrances of
the death of loved ones, the loneliness that some people feel can lead
to doubt and despair.&nbsp; If this weren&#8217;t enough, we are a world at
war.&nbsp; We are at war with terrorists and with Iraq.&nbsp; The news
and our recent election would suggest that we are at war with one
another over what we define as moral issues.&nbsp; We doubt whether our
neighbor sees Jesus in the same way that we do.&nbsp; Because of this,
we too may wonder who Jesus really is in our lives.&nbsp; During this
season of hope, it may sound strange to talk about doubt but clearly
doubt and hope have their place this Advent.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel Reading<br>
      </h4>Our Gospel
comes to bring us hope in this story of a person who wavers between
roles.&nbsp; We can find hope because this story of John the Baptizer
reflects our human experience.&nbsp; Our faith experience is one of
journeying back and forth between doubt and certainty, between despair
and hope. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As John sits within the four walls of prison he is
hearing about the deeds of Christ.&nbsp; Jesus has done many great
things in a very short time, but none of these deeds seem to have
helped John.&nbsp; He is in prison, he will die in prison.&nbsp; There
are no miracles coming his way from the one he called &#8220;more
powerful.&#8221;&nbsp; John proclaimed the one coming after him to not only
be more powerful, but also greater.&nbsp; John says of the Messiah, I
am not worthy to carry his sandals.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
John may not have been so surprised that he ended up in prison.&nbsp;
Many prophets before him had found themselves in similar
circumstances.&nbsp; But, something was missing for this one who
baptized with water.&nbsp; John believed the Messiah would come and
baptize with fire.&nbsp; Part of that fire likely would have looked
like military might.&nbsp; Yet, as John sits in the walls of prison,
doubt comes to him.&nbsp; Rather than fire, Jesus comes and is baptized
with water by John.&nbsp; Rather than clearing his threshing floor with
a winnowing fork, Jesus points to what is seen and heard from
him.&nbsp; &#8220;The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have
good news brought to them.&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
What do we miss because we expect things to go a certain way?&nbsp; Do
we doubt our children will be successful because their talents are
different than ours and we don&#8217;t understand them?&nbsp; Do we doubt our
neighbor&#8217;s faith because they pull out things from the Gospel that we
think are less important, or that miss the point completely?&nbsp; Do
we doubt that we can find happiness in this season because we have lost
a loved one, have less money to spend, have stopped believing in Santa
Claus and are just too tired to face the season with all its
expectation and hype?&nbsp; Do we doubt Jesus thinking to ourselves,
&#8220;What has he done for me lately?&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Jesus didn&#8217;t come as John expected him.&nbsp; John asks of Jesus, &#8220;Are
you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?&#8221;&nbsp; We
may ask a similar question of Jesus, &#8220;In a day when there are so many
voices and signs, which ones point to you Jesus?&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus response
to John and his disciples is to tell John what they see Jesus has
done.&nbsp; And then, Jesus talks about what John has done for those
who sought him out.&nbsp; John we are told was more than a
prophet.&nbsp; We are more than what our culture tells us we are.&nbsp;
We are more than our job, our toys, our looks, our role.&nbsp; We are
children of God, inheritors of the Kingdom.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>As we have become more and more isolated, I believe Isaiah becomes
more and more a relevant book for us.&nbsp; In a sense we have been
exiled from community by the push toward individualism.&nbsp; I have a
friend who blames the loss of community in the Midwest to the invention
of the air conditioner.&nbsp; While before on hot humid days, people
would be meeting under the shade of the neighborhood tree, now people
go to the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp; No longer are people
drinking lemonade under the Old Oak tree.&nbsp; We are a dispersed
people.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage from Isaiah seeks to give voice to the
exiled.&nbsp; The final line of verse 10 catches the feel for the whole
poem.&nbsp; Sorrow and sighing or another interpretation of the Hebrew,
sorrow and groaning shall flee away.&nbsp; The promise is for
everlasting joy and singing shall return.&nbsp; A word study shows that
the same word for sighing or groaning is the word used for woman during
childbirth.&nbsp; I have heard many women claim that they have done
more of the latter during childbirth.&nbsp; The hope is found that the
ransomed of the Lord shall return and community will be found
again.&nbsp; The four walls in these verses are put up because of the
separation from the community that comes together to worship God.&nbsp;
The hope is found in a savior who with Christian eyes we see is the one
who restores sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, walking to the
lame, speech to the mute.<br>
<br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading<br>
</h4>James is talking to his community that expects that the advent of
God&#8217;s judgment is at hand.&nbsp; James expects this judgment to
vindicate the poor and to punish the rich.&nbsp; These words are of
comfort for the community that is being persecuted.&nbsp; The pastoral
word is for those in need of strength to last the time of trial.&nbsp;
Here is a call of patience and toward lifting one up in
community.&nbsp; For those who are disgruntled, their anger should be
directed toward God who can hear it and not toward one another.<br>
