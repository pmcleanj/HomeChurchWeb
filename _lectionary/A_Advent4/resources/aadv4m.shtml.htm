<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<strong>Isaiah 7:10-16</strong>
<p>Assyria, under Tiglath-pileser III, is intent on expanding westwards. The kings of &#8220;Aram&#8221; (vv.

&#8220;Ephraim&#8221;) have formed a coalition to resist the advances of their common enemy. They have tried to convince &#8220;Ahaz&#8221; (v.

to join the alliance; he has refused. Now they seek to put a puppet
king on Judah&#8217;s throne. God has commanded Isaiah to &#8220;meet Ahaz&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>) as he inspects the water supply 
vital to Jerusalem&#8217;s defence. Isaiah tells him: &#8220;take heed ... do not fear ... these two smoldering stumps of firebrands&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) who have &#8220;plotted evil

you do not stand firm in faith&#8221; (v.

counsel, you will be defeated.</p>
<p>God now speaks again to Ahaz: ask any &#8220;sign&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>),
any confirmation of my promise delivered by Isaiah &#8211; any at all in all
creation. (&#8220;Sheol&#8221; was the subterranean abode of the dead.). But it
seems that Ahaz has already made up his mind (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>) so, through Isaiah, God gives 
to the &#8220;house of David&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>) not a &#8220;sign&#8221; (v.

to convince Ahaz, but one which speaks to future generations. God will
keep the promise he made to David (through Nathan): &#8220;Your house and
your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me&#8221; (2 Samuel <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+7%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:16</a>). &#8220;The young

Ahaz&#8217;s wife) is pregnant; David&#8217;s line will continue; she will name her son &#8220;Immanuel&#8221; (meaning <em>God with us</em>). (This son was Hezekiah.) In a devastated land (paying heavy tribute to Assyria), where only basic food is 
available (&#8220;curds and honey&#8221;, v.

he will develop moral discrimination &#8211; unlike recent kings, who were
deemed wicked, ungodly people. By this time, Assyria will have
conquered both Syria and Israel (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+7%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>).</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 80:1-7,17-19</strong>
<p>This is a prayer for deliverance from Israel&#8217;s enemies, calling on
God to &#8220;shine forth&#8221; (smile), be favourably disposed towards his
people. God was seen as enthroned invisibly on the &#8220;cherubim&#8221;, the
half-human, half-animal winged creatures on the Ark. From the mention

<b>Romans</b>
</small><p>
<small>Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

<hr>
<strong>Romans 1:1-7</strong>
<p>Paul introduces himself to his readers: </p>
<ls>
<li>as &#8220;servant&#8221; (literally <em>slave</em>) of Christ, one under more than the usual obligation Christians have to Jesus; </li>
<li>as an &#8220;apostle&#8221;, one sent with a special mission of divine origin; and </li>
<li>as &#8220;set apart&#8221; to spread God&#8217;s good news.</li>
</ls>
<p> (Paul does not reserve the title <em>apostle</em> for the Twelve.) This news of eternal life with God was &#8220;promised beforehand&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>):
it has been part of God&#8217;s plan since before creation. God made known
his promise &#8220;through his prophets&#8221; (principally Isaiah and Jeremiah) in
books held to have authority. (When Paul wrote, both Testaments were
yet to be defined.) The &#8220;gospel&#8221; (good news, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>) is about one very close 
to God, &#8220;his Son&#8221;, here identified in two ways: </p>
<ls>
<li>physically (&#8220;flesh&#8221;): of David&#8217;s line, so meeting the Old Testament prerequisites for messiahship, and </li>
<li>spiritually (&#8220;spirit ...&#8221;,</li>
</ls>
<p> v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>): definitively stated by 
God to be the &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Messiah) in resurrecting him.</p>
<p>It is through Christ that Paul (&#8220;we&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
has received &#8220;grace&#8221; (God&#8217;s freely given gift of love) and
&#8220;apostleship&#8221; (authority to teach and proclaim the good news) &#8211; with
the objective of bringing people (especially non-Jews) to faith in God
and thus making it possible for them to place themselves under God&#8217;s
authority (&#8220;obedience of faith&#8221;). Paul sees the Christians at &#8220;Rome&#8221;
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) as &#8220;called to be 
saints&#8221;: literally <em>called holy ones</em>,
belonging to God and consecrated to his service. (The same Greek words
are found in the Septuagint, the Greek translation Paul would have
used, to describe the Israelite community. We, he suggests, are in
continuity with them. In v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>, he sees himself as in being in 
continuity with Moses, Joshua and Abraham - all called <em>servants of God</em> in the Old Testament.) Finally, he wishes the Roman community both God&#8217;s &#8220;grace&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+1%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>)
and his &#8220;peace&#8221;, the Jewish notion of a right relationship with God -
partnership in reconciliation of all to him, eternal well-being, and
wholeness of life.</p>

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

<strong>Matthew 1:18-25</strong>
<p>Matthew has told us of Jesus&#8217; descent from David. He is the anointed
(&#8220;Messiah&#8221;) king God has promised. Joseph&#8217;s and Mary&#8217;s families
(&#8220;engaged&#8221;) have signed a marriage contract but Joseph has not yet <em>taken her</em> (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+1%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>)
into his house. If Mosaic law on sexual relations was fully observed
then, Joseph could have brought charges against her, and she could have
been stoned to death (&#8220;public disgrace&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+1%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>) for <em>adultery</em>
(then including pre-marital sex). Joseph, while observant of the Law
(&#8220;righteous&#8221;), is compassionate: he &#8220;planned to dismiss [divorce] her
quietly&#8221;. God had intervened in the birth of some he has chosen -
Isaac, Jacob and Samuel &#8211; but never before has he replaced the whole
male role. Even so, the messenger from God points out Joseph&#8217;s role:
Jesus is legally descended from David through him. In Aramaic and
Hebrew, &#8220;Jesus&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+1%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>) and &#8220;he will save&#8221; 
sound similar. Matthew is keen to show that Jesus fulfills God&#8217;s promise made through Isaiah (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+1%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>). In v.
