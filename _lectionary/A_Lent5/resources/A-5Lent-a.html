<h4>Hope in a Time of Loss</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>What was the last funeral you attended? Was the deceased close to you? Did you need time to grieve?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">In spite of all our efforts, we cannot escape
death. How we face death, however, can help determine our quality of
life. Does the end of life give us despair or hope? In the story of
Lazarus, John challenges us to see hope in death through the eyes of
faith.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>3 The sisters Mary and Martha sent Jesus a
message: "Lord, your close friend Lazarus is ill." 4 When Jesus heard
this, he replied,<font color="#ee0000"> "The illness of Lazarus isn't
the end of him. It's really for the glory of God! And, through this
illness, God's Son will receive glory."</font> 5 Now, Jesus really
liked Martha, her sister Mary, and brother Lazarus. 6 But, when he
heard Lazarus was ill, Jesus stayed where he was. 7 Two days later,
Jesus finally told his followers, <font color="#ee0000">"Let's go to Judea."</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>17 When Jesus arrived at Bethany in Judea,
Martha and Mary's hometown, he found out Lazarus was dead. He had been
buried four days before.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>20 Martha heard Jesus had come to town. So,
she went to met him, while her sister Mary remained at home. 21 "Lord!"
Martha exclaimed. "If you would have been here earlier, my brother
wouldn't have died! 22 But even now I know whatever you ask God to do,
he will do it!"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>23 <font color="#ee0000">"Your brother will rise again,"</font> Jesus replied.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>24 "Yes," Martha said. "I know he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>25<font color="#ee0000"> "I am the resurrection and the life!"</font> Jesus exclaimed. <font color="#ee0000">"The
person who trusts me will live with God, even though his body dies. 26
Everyone who trusts me and lives with God will never really die. Do you
believe this?"</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>27 "Yes, Lord," Martha answered. "I really believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God! God sent you into the world for us."</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>33b Jesus was deeply touched. 34 <font color="#ee0000">"Where did you bury Lazarus?"</font> he asked the people around him.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>"Come and see, Lord," they replied. 35 At
this, Jesus cried. 36 "See how much Lazarus meant to Jesus," they
whispered to each other. 27 But others grumbled, "Jesus cured the blind
man in Jerusalem. Why couldn't he keep Lazarus from dying?"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>38 The tomb where Lazarus was buried was a
cave with a large stone over the entrance. When Jesus came to the tomb,
he again was deeply touched. 39 <font color="#ee0000">"Take the stone away!"</font> Jesus commanded.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>"But, Lord!" Martha objected. "We buried him four days ago. He will have the stench of death!"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>40 <font color="#ee0000">"Didn't I tell you if you trusted me you would see the glory of God?"</font> Jesus replied. 41 So, they took the stone away from the tomb entrance. Jesus looked up and prayed, <font color="#ee0000">"Father, thank you for listening to me, as you always do. 42 I say this prayer, so the people here might believe you sent me."</font> 43 Then, Jesus screamed, <font color="#ee0000">"Lazarus! Come out here!"</font>
44 Lazarus came out of the tomb with his hands and feet tied in burial
bandages, and with his face covered with a cloth shroud. <font color="#ee0000">"Untie him,"</font> Jesus commanded.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>45 Many of the people who came to Mary's house saw what Jesus did. And they put their trust in him.</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">The narrative about the resurrection of Lazarus
stood out as the premier miracle before the Passion. John crafted the
story to remove any doubt in the power of Jesus. And to present the
reader with a real challenge of faith in God's Son.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>3 Then, the sisters (Martha and Mary) sent (a
message) to HIM, saying, "Lord, Look! (The one) you love is ill." 4
Hearing (the message), JESUS said, <font color="#ee0000">"This illness will not (lead) to death, but (is) for the glory of God, so that the Son of God might be glorified through it."</font>
5 Now, JESUS loved Martha and Mary, her sister, and Lazarus. 6 So, when
HE heard that (Lazarus) was ill, HE stayed in the place (that) HE was
two (more) days. 7 Then, after this (time frame), HE said to his
disciples, <font color="#ee0000">"Let us go to Judea again."</font></b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>17 Coming (to Bethany) then, JESUS found him having been in the tomb already four days.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>20 So, when she heard that Jesus was coming,
Martha met HIM. But Mary sat at home. 21 Thus, Martha said to JESUS,
"Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died. 22 Even now I
know that whatever (petitions) you ask God, God will give you." 23
JESUS told to her, <font color="#ee0000">"Your brother will rise again."</font> 24 Martha said to HIM, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day." 25 JESUS told to her,<font color="#ee0000">
"I am the resurrection and the life. The (person) trusting me, even if
he should die, will live. 26 Everyone living and trusting me does not
die in the (final) age. Do you believe this?</font>" 27 "She said to
HIM, "Yes, Lord! I have (and continue to) believe that you are the
Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world."</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>33b HE groaned (with anger) in (his) spirit, he was troubled, 34 and (HE) said, <font color="#ee0000">"Where did you lay him?"</font>
They said to HIM, "LORD, come and see." 35 JESUS cried. 36 So, the Jews
said, "See how much (JESUS) loved him!" 37 But some of them said, "Was
this (MAN), the (one) opening the eyes of the blind (man), not able to
make (it happen), so that even this (man) should not die?" 38 Then,
JESUS, again groaning (with anger) inside himself, came to the tomb,
(which) was a cave and a stone was lying upon it. 39 JESUS said, <font color="#ee0000">"Lift (away) the stone!"</font>
Martha, the sister of the one having died, said to HIM, "LORD, he has a
(death) stench now, for it is the fourth (day since his burial)." 40
JESUS said to her, <font color="#ee0000">"Did I not tell you that, if you trusted (me), you would see the glory of God?"</font> 41 So, they lifted (away) the stone. Jesus lifted up (his) eyes and said, <font color="#ee0000">"Father!
I thank you that you listen to me. 42 I know that you always listen to
me, but I say (this) because of the crowd standing around (here), so
that they might believe that you sent me."</font> 43 After saying these (things) , he cried out in a loud voice,<font color="#ee0000"> "Lazarus! (Come) out here!"</font>
44 The (one) having died came out, (his) feet and hands having been
bound with bandages and his face having been wrapped with a (head)
cloth. JESUS said to them, <font color="#ee0000">"Untie him and let him go."</font> 45 Then, many of the Jews, the ones having come to Mary and having seen what (HE) did, believed in HIM.</b></p>
<p class="indent">11:4 "This illness will not (lead) to death, but (is)
for the glory of God." This illness of Lazarus would lead to his death.
But, implicitly, it would also lead to the death of Jesus. The death of
both men would result in the glory of God, their resurrections. Hence,
the phrase had a double meaning (Lazarus and Jesus).</p>
<p class="indent">"so that the Son of God might be glorified through
it." The phrase "through it" can have a double meaning: the illness and
the glory of God. John could have meant both meanings.</p>
<p class="indent">11:20 "But Mary sat at home." Sitting was the traditional posture of mourning and comforting in the ancient world.</p>
<p class="indent">11:26 "Everyone living and trusting me does not die
in the (final) age." This sentence has two areas that need explanation.
First, "living" could refer to physical life or spiritual life. In the
first case, the translation could read "everyone living (today) and
believing in me." In the second case, "living" and "believing" were
synonymous.</p>
<p class="indent">"...does not die in the (final) age." The "(final) age" referred to the Second Coming and was equivalent to eternal life.</p>
<p class="indent">11:27 "You are the Christ, the Son of God, the One
coming into the world." The three titles in this verse summarized the
gospel writer's view of Jesus: the Messiah, the Son who had a unique
relationship with God the Father, and the Word who came into the world.</p>
<p class="indent">11:33b This verse is difficult to understand,
especially considering the context. The Greek clearly showed that Jesus
was angry. But at who? In 11:33a, Jesus saw Martha and the others
weeping in sincere and in ritual mourning. He reacted with anger and a
troubled heart. Why did Jesus react in this way to a situation that was
culturally appropriate? Was he angry at the crowd's lack of faith? Or
was he angry at death itself? The verse and context do not explain.
Yet, to translate the verse as "deeply moved" does not seem to do
justice to the language. Angry and a troubled heart seemed to the
catapult to the question in 11:34 and the eventual resurrection of
Lazarus (see 11:38).</p>
<p class="indent">11:35 Unlike the cultural wailing expressed in
11:33a, Jesus simply shed tears. (For you trivia buffs, this is the
shortest verse in the Bible.)</p>
<p class="indent">11:39 "for it is the fourth" The word "fourth" is a
adjective that can refer to the day of the dialogue ("it is the fourth
day") or to Lazarus ("he is a fourth day man"). The translation above
used the former meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">11:43 "Lazarus! (Come) out here!" Jesus' command to Lazarus was literally two adverbs ("here out").</p>
<p class="bodytext">As the passage began, Mary and Martha, the sisters
of Lazarus, sent Jesus an urgent note about his grave illness. [11:3]
The note revealed their faith in Jesus only as a healer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus responded with a statement of faith. The
illness would not lead to death, but to God's glory and the glory of
his Son. [11:4] In this sense, death meant the final end of existence.
Jesus inferred death would not end existence for Lazarus or himself.
No, even through sickness and death, people would praise God and his
Son. Death would lead to new life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To make his point, Jesus delayed a few more days,
in spite of his love for the family. By the time he arrived, Lazarus
had been buried for four days. [11:5, 17] Many Jewish rabbis held a
soul hovered near the body for three days; beyond the third day, there
was no hope of reviving the corpse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she left her
home (the customary place of grieving) to meet him. As she greeted
Jesus, she believed in him only as a healer. Yes, placed her faith in
Jesus and in his relationship with the Father. God still worked through
Jesus. But, only if things were different...</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Jesus announced Lazarus would rise again,
Martha responded with an answer many Jews at the time of Jesus held;
Lazarus would indeed rise on the day of judgment. [11:21-24] She could
not see beyond her assumptions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus, then, revealed himself to Martha: "I AM the
resurrection and the life." Just as he identified himself to the
Samaritan woman in John 4:26, Jesus used the phrase "I AM" to denote
his own divinity and his relationship to the Father. He was God and he
was God's instrument.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus directed his identity toward the subject at
hand. "I AM the resurrection and the life." Those who entrust
themselves to Jesus will never see spiritual death. In spite of
physical death, they will always have life in Christ. (Perhaps, we
should reverse the phrase. In Christ, we have eternal life now that
will bring us to resurrection). In 11:23 Jesus inferred Lazarus had
eternal life because he would be raised. Did Martha entrust herself to
Jesus, so she, too, could have life? [11:25-26]</p>
<p class="bodytext">Yes, Martha believed. She saw Jesus was more than a
mere healer. In Jesus, she experienced God. She professed Jesus to be
the Messiah, the One promised in the Scripture. [11:27]</p>
<p class="bodytext">But, Mary and the others did not understand. Their
sorrow moved Jesus, but their immature faith angered him (see 11:32 for
Mary's reaction; 11:37 for the crowd's reaction). At this point, Jesus
felt sorrow for the loss of his friend and indignation at the crowd.
[11:33-38]</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the tomb, Jesus ordered the stone to the tomb
rolled away. Martha objected with the obvious. There would be a stench.
Jesus countered with question of faith. Instead of odor, Martha would
see God's glory through eyes of faith. [11:39-41]</p>
<p class="bodytext">After the stone was removed, Jesus thanked the
Father for their relationship. The Father (always) listened to Jesus.
(He repeated the phrase "listen to me" twice). In Greek, "listen to"
projected as sense outside of time, in the realm of the eternal.
Throughout time, the Father heard the request of the Son. Jesus prayed,
not for his own benefit, but for the faith of his audience. [11:41-42]</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus gave two orders: first, that Lazarus to come
out and, second, that the crowd to untie his burial cloth. [11:43-44]
In these two orders, Jesus showed his faith in the Father was certain.
Those who trusted Jesus could share in that certainty. Those in Christ
would have a life that led to resurrection.</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Themes: Christ's Resurrection and Ours (CCC 992-1004)</p>
<p class="indent">When he created humanity, God sowed the seeds of
salvation, specifically, the resurrection. Over the time, we have come
to realize God wants more for us, his creatures, than a transient
nature. He wants us to live with him as he created us, body and soul.</p>
<p class="indent">As Christ rose from the dead, he became a sign of our
destiny and a pledge of God's will for us. More important, when we join
ourselves to Christ, we share in the power of his resurrection. Like
the "here.. but not yet" nature of God's Kingdom, we experience rising
from spiritual death every time we reconcile with Christ and join
intimately with him in the Eucharist. Yet, our physical resurrection is
to come.</p>
<p class="indent">"What is rising?" When we rise from the dead, we will be made permanently whole, body and spirit, never to die again.</p>
<p class="indent">"Who will rise?" The blessed will see God forever while the damned will eternally reject his presence.</p>
<p class="indent">"How?" We will rise in the same way Christ rose,
through the same power of his resurrection. Our lowly bodies will
become "spiritual." While we do not know the specifics of this new
life, we can rest assured in the knowledge it will happen.</p>
<p class="indent">"When?" We will rise on the last day, when Christ will return to judge all humanity.</p>
<p class="indent">Because God will raise our bodies up on the last day,
our bodies are the vessels of salvation. To show our faith in Christ,
we wash our bodies in the waters of Baptism and nourish them with the
Bread of Life at Eucharist. In these ways, our bodies partake in their
future glory, here and now. Thus we should show respect to our bodies
and to others', especially the weak and the suffering. And we should
honor the bodies of the dead who live with the Lord.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How can faith strengthen you in your loss? Do
you know of anyone who has lost a loved one and who has become stronger
because of faith?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">The loss of a loved one can bring despair in the
loss, or it can bring hope found in the resurrection. Our hope depends
upon our faith in Christ. Is our faith active, seeking a closer walk
with the Lord? Or, is the Lord at a comfortable distance of our
choosing? Remember, how we live reflects how we view death..</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Does the idea of death inspire faith or doubt? Share your answer with the Lord in prayer. </i></p>
