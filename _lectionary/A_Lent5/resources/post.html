<b>Ezekiel</b>
</small><p>
<small>Ezekiel was a prophet and a priest. His ministry began before the 
conquest of Judah in 587 BC, and continued in exile in Babylon. This 
book is the foundation for both Jewish and Christian visionary or 
apocalyptic literature, e.g. Revelation (or The Apocalypse.) It is a 
book that contains many strange things (strange because we do not 
understand them, e.g. Ezekiel eating a scroll), but the prophet's 
message to the exiles is clear: he assures his hearers of God's abiding 
presence among them, and he emphasizes God's involvement in the events 
of the day, so that Israel and all nations "will know that I am the Lord". 
For the first time, we see the importance of the individual in his 
relationship to God. To a dispersed and discouraged people, he brings 
a message of hope: hope that God will restore them to their homeland 
and the temple.

<strong>Ezekiel 37:1-14</strong>
<p>It is likely that Ezekiel was among those deported when the
Babylonians first took Jerusalem, in 598 BC. He opposed a political
solution to Judah&#8217;s woes, espousing instead the notion of Israel as a
community faithful to God in religious observance and obedience. Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+37%3A1-10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-10</a> are a vision, a prophecy, 
and vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+37%3A1-14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-14</a>
the interpretation. The &#8220;valley&#8221; is probably the Tigris-Euphrates
plain. The scene the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of God shows the prophet is of an arid
place, perhaps the site of a battle. The bones are &#8220;very dry&#8221;, long
lifeless; they symbolize the exiles, who lack hope of resuscitation of
the kingdom of Israel: see v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+37%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11a</a>. Contrasting with the dead 
bones are &#8220;breath&#8221; and &#8220;spirit&#8221; &#8211; both <em>ru&#8217;ah</em> in Hebrew. See especially v.

&#8220;graves&#8221;. God will renew the covenant, restoring Israel &#8211; but probably spiritually rather than literally. Perhaps v.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 130</strong>
<p>This is a prayer for deliverance from personal trouble, but it ends
with a message to all people. The &#8220;depths&#8221; are the chaotic waters,
separation from God &#8211; as in Jonah&#8217;s prayer from the stomach of the
great fish (Jonah <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jonah+2%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:2</a>). May God be attentive to my 
pleas. God forgives, so he shall be &#8220;revered&#8221; (v.

misdeeds, how could anyone face him? He is merciful by nature, so I eagerly await his help, his &#8220;word&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+130%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>), a prophecy from him. I wait as 
do watchmen guarding a town from enemy attack (v.

prophecy of salvation which he tells to all Israel: wait in hope for God; he offers unfailing &#8220;love&#8221;, freedom from grievous sin.</p>

<b>Romans</b>
</small><p>
<small>Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Romans 8:6-11</strong>
<p>Paul has written that, as a result of God's love shown in the
liberating act of Christ's death and resurrection, we are empowered to
live a new life, one of freedom from sin, from the finality of death
and the Law. As experience shows, the Christian is able to live a life
for God, in the Spirit. Christian life is bound up in the Spirit, and
not by the desires of the flesh. Now he explains the difference between
what he calls <em>living in the Spirit</em> and <em>living according to 
the flesh</em>: two very different mindsets (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+8%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). A person whose mind &#8220;is 
set on the flesh&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+8%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>),
whose view is limited to the natural world, is at enmity with God
because he is fundamentally unable to obey God's law &#8211; he lacks the
power to transcend his inner conflicts, and &#8220;cannot please God&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+8%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). On the other hand, Christians 
are in the Spirit (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+8%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>)
and the &#8220;Spirit ... dwells in you&#8221;, i.e. the Spirit fills and motivates
our lifestyle. Attachment to Christ (belief in him) is only possible in
this kind of relationship: Christ and the Spirit come together. Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+8%3A10-11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10-11</a>
say: if Christ (or the Spirit) is in you, though you may be a corpse
because of all the wrong you have done, you are actually very much
alive &#8211; because of the Spirit. If God's Spirit is in you, God will
resuscitate your bodies (from being corpses) through the Spirit, in
raising you to new life at the end of time.</p>

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 11:1-45</strong>
<p>Jesus is beyond the reach of the Jewish religious authorities,
across the Jordan when Martha and Mary (in &#8220;Bethany&#8221;, near Jerusalem)
send a message to him (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>): Lazarus, a follower, is ill. 
Jesus says that his illness is not terminal, rather it will show the &#8220;glory&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>, power and authority) the Father 
has bestowed on the Son. We will see why Jesus delays (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). He urges the disciples to return 
to &#8220;Judea&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) with 
him, but they remind him of what happened when he was last there (v.

there is still time (&#8220;hours of daylight&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) to do God&#8217;s work; harm will 
not come to him &#8220;during the day&#8221;. Those who do dark deeds will fail because I am not in them (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>). His words in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a> are ambiguous, as v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a> explains: the disciples think 
that Lazarus&#8217; sleep indicates that he is getting better (&#8220;all right&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>), but Jesus clarifies: 
&#8220;Lazarus is dead&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>).
Note Jesus&#8217; clairvoyance. Restoring Lazarus to life will be a greater
opportunity (than just healing him) for strengthening the disciples&#8217;
faith in Jesus (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A15" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15</a>). Thomas shows courageous 
loyalty.</p>
<p>People thought that one&#8217;s soul <em>hovered</em> around one&#8217;s body for three days, but when Jesus arrives, Lazarus has been dead for &#8220;four days&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>). (Bodies were buried on the day 
of death.) Per custom, many have come to &#8220;console&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>) the sisters. Perhaps Martha sets 
out to warn Jesus of the rites while Mary receives mourners (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>). Martha rebukes Jesus for his 
tardiness but shows her confidence in his ability to heal (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>). She goes further: perhaps 
because the Father grants the Son whatever he asks, Jesus will restore life to Lazarus (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>). She, as many did, believed in 
&#8220;the resurrection [of all] on the last day&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>), but this is small comfort to 
her now. Jesus identifies himself as he who raises believers from death (&#8220;resurrection&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A25" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">25</a>)
and who is the principle of &#8220;life&#8221;. Physical death is normal, even so
life in Christ will continue, and this life cannot be taken away by the
death of the body. Martha affirms her faith in Jesus in terms used
earlier by Andrew, Nathanael and those present at the Feeding of the
Five Thousand. Jesus and Martha are still outside Bethany. She discerns
that Jesus wishes to speak to Mary. She tells Mary &#8220;privately&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A28" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">28</a>)
either so she can escape from the visitors or to shield Jesus from any
who plot against him. The visitors see Mary leave, and follow her.
Mary&#8217;s words to Jesus echo Martha&#8217;s. Jesus is &#8220;disturbed&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A33" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">33</a>) inwardly by the crowd&#8217;s 
attitude towards death; his humanity shows in v.

causing some to say that he weeps at the loss of a friend, but others
criticize him: if he&#8217;d been here earlier, being a miracle-worker, he
could have healed him! (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A37" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">37</a>). Martha warns him of the 
&#8220;stench&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>) of the 
decaying corpse. Perhaps Jesus prayed at v.

now he publicly thanks the Father &#8211; to help the crowd understand that
his power is from God, and not magic. Being bound in a burial shroud,
Lazarus needs unbinding (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A44" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">44</a>). Many believed because of the 
miracle (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+11%3A45" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">45</a>), but others told the 
Pharisees about it (v.
