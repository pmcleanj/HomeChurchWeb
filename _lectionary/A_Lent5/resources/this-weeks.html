      <h2>Is This All There Is?</h2>The
voices in the scriptures and our daily newspapers speak of despair, God
forsakenness, and death.&nbsp; In college it is easy to ignore the
difficult voices that come from the world.&nbsp; Be it the Lute Dome or
Camp Concordia (I went to one of the other ELCA schools but my wife
assures me it is similar at PLU) one has to make a concerted effort to
not become inward focused while at College.&nbsp; Maybe it has always
been true, but I find that it is difficult not to become inward focused
once you are out of school.&nbsp; Lent has a way of doing this to us
also.&nbsp; We may be tempted today to turn inward to our comfort zone
so we don&#8217;t have to face the gloom that can surround.<br>
      <br>
Today the Psalmist writes, &#8220;Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord!!
&#8212;Lord hear my voice.&nbsp; Let your ears be attentive to the voice of
my supplications.&#8221;&nbsp; Ezekiel proclaims:&nbsp; &#8220;Our bones are dried
up, and our hope is lost:&nbsp; we are completely cut off.&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus
declares: &#8220;Lazarus is dead.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our newspapers continue
to report about the dead in Iraq, murders and rapes in our
hometowns.&nbsp; The temptation may be to ask, &#8220;Is this all there is?&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Sorrow, despair and death are a truth that certainly isn&#8217;t popular and
does not make pleasant conversation.&nbsp; Certainly most of us would
be content to remain blind about certain things.&nbsp; It is the truth
that acknowledges that not all is well in our world, our homes, our
jobs, our schools, our relationship and our faith.&nbsp; There are more
people in valleys of despair, God forsakenness and death than will
admit it or that others will realize and acknowledge.&nbsp; We are all
aware of the valleys of dry bones that exist in our lives.&nbsp; Some
will identify closely with these valleys that come from the depths of
death and discouragement.&nbsp; Others will say that they cannot relate.<br>
      <br>
The realities of brokenness are known to God and God has acted on our
behalf.&nbsp; God has reached into the deepest pit of despair with the
promise to redeem.&nbsp; God has walked into the valley of death
breathing life into dust blown bones and God&#8217;s final command to all the
mouth of our graves will be, &#8220;Come Out!&#8221;<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Psalm<br>
      </h4>The psalmist begins,
&#8220;Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord.&nbsp; Lord, hear my
voice.&#8221;&nbsp; In the midst of despair, a great fear is that we will not
be heard.&nbsp; So much despair is left in silence.&nbsp; There is a
powerful cultural force out there that says my problems are my
own.&nbsp; We wish not to be a burden on others.&nbsp; To make matters
worse, as the world becomes &#8220;smaller&#8221; due to the communication highway
we ironically are becoming more isolated and often more silent. The
silence is not the truth for anyone and it is not the truth for
Christians.&nbsp; Whether or not we feel it, realize it or acknowledge
it; we are broken people living in a broken world in need of
healing.&nbsp; Rejoice when you are happy, weep when you are sad; but
at either end of the spectrum we all remain broken people in need of
healing.<br>
      <br>
The voice of this psalm also speaks of the even greater truth about
hope, life and the spirit of truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the movement of
this psalm.&nbsp; In eight short verses we move from despair to
hope.&nbsp; Verses 7 and 8 say, &#8220;O Israel, hope is in the Lord!&nbsp;
For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is great power
to redeem.&nbsp; It is he who will redeem Israel from all its
iniquities.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>&#8220;Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost: we are completely
cut off.&#8221;&nbsp; A great deal of time, money and energy is invested to
cover-up and disguise the brokenness in our lives.&nbsp; People turn to
destructive sources in attempts to cope; such as alcohol, drugs, food,
and physical abuse.&nbsp; Some people dry up and decay slowly, quietly;
while others have the life violently sucked out of them right in front
of us.&nbsp; There seems to be a kind of pressure for Christians to
walk through life with a permanent smile on their faces.&nbsp; Somehow
the idea has prevailed that faithful people are those who are always
happy, upbeat&#8212;praising God and so even in the church pain hides in the
hearts of many.&nbsp; This silence is tragedy.<br>
      <br>
During the exile it would have been easy for Israel to lose all sense
of hope.&nbsp; Silence could have easily become the mode of
operation.&nbsp; But through the exile comes a new hope.&nbsp; Even
away from Jerusalem God&#8217;s breath can bring life to that which is old
and dried up.&nbsp; Ezekiel proclaims: &#8220;Thus says the Lord God, and you
shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and bring you
up from your graves, O my people.&nbsp; I will put my spirit within
you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then
you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken and will act.&#8221;<br>
<br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>God
has entered into this broken world in Jesus Christ breaking the bonds
that bind us to death.&nbsp; God&#8217;s spirit moves, bringing life to the
most unlikely places and the most seemingly hopeless situations; like
dry bones and a man dead four days.<br>
      <br>
In this story too we start in the midst of despair.&nbsp; Lazarus is
dead and Jesus weeps.&nbsp; The Gospel of John breaks through the
silence of death and exposes some real emotions, even for the one who
is the &#8220;resurrection and the life.&#8221;&nbsp; Through the despair is the
hope for what life is like with Jesus.&nbsp; Death will not have the
last word over the Messiah, the Son of God.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This Gospel reminds us that we should not be afraid to speak the truth
about our own pain or the pain of others.&nbsp; Expose the wounds to
Christ and invite the healing of gracious love and forgiveness that
unbinds us.&nbsp; It is Christ that speaks the final truth in the face
of despair and death.&nbsp; &#8220;Come out&#8230;unbind him and let him go.&#8221;<br>
