<br>
We are so near to Jerusalem. To Jerusalem, and Calvary, and the cross. In fact, 
the text says we are &#8220;two miles away,&#8221; in this place of death and mourning, at 
the grave and with those who gather nearby, troubled in spirit. And we are, in 
church time, only two weeks away from The Empty Tomb. How fitting, then &#8211; and 
how challenging &#8211; to read, on this Fifth Sunday of Lent, this text of the raising 
of Lazarus, set firmly within, even entangled with, the controversy and plots 
that swirl around Jesus. There are those who see in the words and the works of 
Jesus &#8211; even in the healings &#8211; a blasphemy that deserves death. But Jesus claims 
to be doing the works of &#8220;the Father,&#8221; so even the worries and warnings of his 
disciples do not keep him from making his way not only to Lazarus&#8217; tomb, but to 
his own place of suffering, death, and, eventually, resurrection. <br>
<br>
But first, there is his own grief over the death of his friend. In this story, 
there is so much of the human experience: receiving word of a loved one&#8217;s illness 
and need; decision-making, timing, and complications, even risks and dangers to 
be considered; frustrations, questioning, and lack of understanding on the part 
of those closest to us; grief and mourning by loved ones, and the community encircling 
them, perhaps not all with the purest of intentions; hope, and the profession 
of faith and &#8220;what might have been&#8221;; limited understanding of what we ourselves 
are saying, of the potential of what we are saying; courage, anger, and weeping; 
familiar, powerful echoes of other moments in the story we share: &#8220;Where have 
you laid him?&#8221; and &#8220;Come and see&#8221;; mixed motives and responses, for some saw how 
much Jesus loved his friend while others, in the face of physical evidence (the 
tomb), cynically questioned his power and its political effects; the trust of 
Mary and Martha, even in the face of physical reality (the stench); and finally, 
most powerfully, release, glory, and Jesus&#8217; own gratitude to God. <br>
<br>
We do not hear a word from Lazarus or know of his response to his extraordinary 
experience. But we are not surprised by the response of the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; people 
who witnessed the extraordinary that day: again, a range of reactions, from faith 
and following to fear and fretting. If we read just beyond today&#8217;s passage, we 
find the report of those who went to the religious authorities and speculated 
on the dangers of having such a powerful man &#8220;loose&#8221; in the midst of the people, 
who turned to him in hope. The raising of Lazarus is not just a nice little story 
of friendship or a random and amazing miracle; it is set in the context of the 
journey to the cross (and the empty tomb). This great work of raising Lazarus 
from the dead sets things in motion in the hearts and minds of those who feared 
Jesus, and these things led to his own death. There is a reason we read it today. 
<br>
<br>
We hear the words of Jesus, &#8220;Unbind him, and let him go.&#8221; How many of us have 
known the feel of those strips of cloth, the grave&#8217;s apparel, the shroud that 
wraps us up in a leaden existence this side of physical death and makes us long 
for release, for the light of day and the feel of fresh air of freedom in our 
lungs? What are the &#8220;strips of cloth&#8221; that bind us, the addictions and fears, 
and the feelings of hopelessness and loss? What is the grief, the anxiety, the 
financial deprivation, the hatred, the resentment, or the lack of faith that has 
put us in our own tomb of despair? A long time ago, in a far-off land, Jesus stood 
outside that tomb and called out, &#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221; <i><b>God is still speaking</b></i> 
to us today, calling us out from our tombs of despair, denial, and death to new 
life, right now, right here. What are those tombs for you and your congregation? 
In what ways do you participate in what God is doing, today, in your midst, when 
God brings new life in the face of death? How are you &#8220;unbinding&#8221; and &#8220;letting 
go&#8221; those who have been put into such places of death? Are some in your congregation 
standing around and watching, forming their judgments and deciding what they&#8217;ll 
believe and how much they&#8217;ll believe it, or are they moving to the center of what 
is happening, pulling back the &#8220;stuff&#8221; of death, the things that surround death, 
and releasing the new life that God has granted, the new life that lies just beneath 
the surface of what appears bleak and beyond hope? Are there some among us who 
are calculating the costs and the possible unpleasantness of giving ourselves 
over to the power of God, even to healing and new life? <br>
<br>
Martha&#8217;s great profession of faith &#8211; from a woman in the Gospel of John, certainly 
worth noting &#8211; is also an interesting moment in this beautiful and complex story. 
How do we move from just saying what we believe to giving our selves and our lives 
over to transformation and the new life that God brings? How often, in fact, we 
do say we believe but live as if we do not? Where does our religious imagination 
fail us, and we &#8220;stop dead,&#8221; refuse to move to places of new life and possibility? 
What does the world tell us about &#8220;real life&#8221; and how does that contrast with 
a gospel vision of being truly alive? How is <i><b>God still speaking</b></i> 
words of new life today, to your congregation? What do we think we need to do 
in order to &#8220;achieve&#8221; or &#8220;accomplish&#8221; new life, as if it were our doing, and not 
God&#8217;s? <br>
<br>
&#8220;Jesus began to weep.&#8221; More often than not, we fail to experience Jesus&#8217; humanity. 
These words strongly suggest that he knew anger, and grief, and deep spiritual 
pain, just as we do. He was moved to compassion and sadness even as he knew that 
all this had happened for the glory of God. Can we imagine the tears of Jesus, 
and do they transform our understanding, too? What is <i><b>God speaking to us 
today</b></i>, in the tears of Jesus? <br>
<br>
How and when have we been Lazarus in this story? Perhaps just as important: how 
and when have we been part of the crowd, which moves around in the background, 
trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on, drawing conclusions, not wanting to miss 
anything, helping to release the dead man&#8230;and then going back to our lives. Are 
we transformed, believing, experiencing new life &#8211; or critical, suspicious, cynical? 
<br>
<br>
The lectionary texts also include the familiar &#8220;dry bones&#8221; passage from the prophet 
Ezekiel, a powerful vision of communal hope in the face of utter despair and death. 
God delivers a message to the people through the prophet about just how impressively 
the Spirit animates our barren desolation and transforms apparent nothingness 
into vigor and vitality. Who are you &#8220;as a people&#8221;? When have you experienced 
setbacks, alienation, dislocation, and apparent scarcity to such a degree that 
you thought there was no hope? Have you ever witnessed such a scene that reminds 
you of the rattling of dry bones joining together, the sinews and flesh forming 
upon them, and the breath of the Spirit bringing movement and energy? Throughout 
history, there have been peoples and communities who have known such suffering 
and loss that they must have feared their own obliteration, and yet&#8230;and yet&#8230;walls 
come down, laws are carved not for oppression but to end it, elections are held 
and results can be trusted, and there is hope and new life once again. We know 
it can happen. There are churches that have been on the brink of closing that 
are restored to new vitality, neighborhoods painstakingly rebuilt and brought 
back to new life, relationships formed across fallen barriers and new possibilities 
brought into being. <br><br>
What are your church&#8217;s memories or present experiences of barren existence, and 
how are you open to the movement, the breath of the Spirit, to bring this new 
life again? What has &#8220;new life&#8221; looked like to your congregation? In what ways 
do you hear <i><b>God still speaking</b></i> to you and your church today, as 
God spoke to the prophet on that seemingly hopeless plain so long ago? What is 
the call that you hear from this <i><b>still-speaking God?</b></i> What hospitality, 
what justice, what witness is the <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i> calling you 
to embody, in your bones, your flesh, your sinews, today, in your own setting 
of the church?

world. But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.&#8221; 
After saying this, he told them, &#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I 
am going there to awaken him.&#8221; The disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, if he has fallen 
asleep, he will be all right.&#8221; Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, 
but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, 
&#8220;Lazarus is dead. For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. 
But let us go to him.&#8221; Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, 
&#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four 
days. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, and many of the Jews 
had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother. When Martha heard 
that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home. Martha 
said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But 
even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.&#8221; Jesus said to 
her, &#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221; Martha said to him, &#8220;I know that he will 
rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&#8221; Jesus said to her, &#8220;I am the 
resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will 
live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe 
this?&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son 
of God, the one coming into the world.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and told 
her privately, &#8220;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#8221; And when she heard 
it, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, 
but was still at the place where Martha had met him. The Jews who were with her 
in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed 
her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there. When Mary 
came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, &#8220;Lord, 
if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221; When Jesus saw her weeping, 
and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit 
and deeply moved. He said, &#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;Lord, 
come and see.&#8221; Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, &#8220;See how he loved him!&#8221; 
But some of them said, &#8220;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have 
kept this man from dying?&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and 
a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, &#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221; Martha, the sister 
of the dead man, said to him, &#8220;Lord, already there is a stench because he has 
been dead four days.&#8221; Jesus said to her, &#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believed, 
you would see the glory of God?&#8221; So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked 
upward and said, &#8220;Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always 
hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that 
they may believe that you sent me.&#8221; When he had said this, he cried with a loud 
voice, &#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221; The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with 
strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, &#8220;Unbind 
him, and let him go.&#8221; Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had 
seen what Jesus did, believed in him.

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Each year, on this Sunday, we remember the heroic Africans who seized the slave 
ship Amistad, and the Connecticut Congregationalists who responded to the mutineers&#8217; 
arrest by organizing in their defense. Altogether, what we celebrate today is 
a story so astonishing that it seems almost miraculous. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Among the extraordinary aspects of the Amistad affair, perhaps none is more 
remarkable than the identity of the man who pled the case of the captive Mendis 
before the U.S. Supreme Court, and won their freedom. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">John Quincy Adams had served as President of the United States and Secretary 
of State. He was renowned as a diplomat and statesman--but not as a crusader for 
human rights. In an age when much of the fervor for the abolition of slavery was 
evangelical, Adams was sober, even Puritanical, in his temperament. It was his 
custom, even in the White House, to arise each morning at five or six o&#8217;clock 
and walk several miles until sunrise. Back at the executive mansion, he would 
read three chapters of the Bible with commentaries. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Those who know only that John Quincy Adams was the son of the second President, 
one of the &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; who signed the Declaration of Independence, may 
think of him as a man of privilege who experienced nothing but success and esteem. 
But John Quincy Adams suffered disappointment and defeat in public life, and he 
and his wife Louisa twice endured tragedy when two of their three grown sons died, 
one a suicide and the other from alcoholism. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Asked his rules for surviving the failures and tragedies of life, Adams later 
replied that they were three: regularity, regularity, regularity. The regular 
activity of body and mind guided by self-discipline and Christian prayer, he declared, 
helped him overcome depression and frustration, the unavoidable and inevitable 
components of life. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> Not so bad a philosophy of life.

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->
</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one 
psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative 
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
