<P>&nbsp;<U><B>Luke 4:21-30</B></U> is the conclusion of the story
begun in Luke 4:14-20 that made up the Gospel Lesson for the Third
Sunday in Epiphany.&nbsp; In that lesson, we noted that Jesus both
inaugurated his ministry and stated what he perceived as his primary
mission.&nbsp; In fact, it is the one place in the Gospels where he
does state unequivocally his mission.&nbsp; What Jesus saw as the
thrust of his work was to proclaim good news to the poor, set
captives free, recover the sight of the blind, set at liberty those
who are oppressed and to proclaim &ldquo;the year of the Lord&rsquo;s
favor&rdquo; (that is, Jubilee) (4:18-19).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In Jewish society, the Jubilee was the most radical
vehicle for bringing about a redistribution of the wealth of the
nation, so that no one would sink into the depths of poverty nor
would anyone accumulate so much wealth he could became unaccountable
for his actions.&nbsp; It existed to maintain a &ldquo;golden mean&rdquo;
of status, privilege, power and wealth in the nation, so that the
community would be preserved as an equitable community.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It was not simply a redistribution of wealth about
which Jesus was concerned.&nbsp; He was committed to seeing Israel
recapture for its life together the &ldquo;shalom community&rdquo; of
the Old Testament (what Jesus called &ldquo;the kingdom of God&rdquo;).&nbsp;
He wanted a nation and all its people who would be faithful to the
Deuteronomic ideal of justice for all, an equitable distribution of
wealth and elimination of poverty, and a society living in a
relationship of love and trust with God and with each other.&nbsp;
And the key to making that great reversal happen was full obedience
to and the practice of the Jubilee.&nbsp; It was this mission that
Jesus assumes that is presented in Luke 4:14-20.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>How did Luke indicate that Jesus went about seeking
to proclaim this message and acting to get Israel to re-embrace the
dream of the shalom community?&nbsp; He did it in three ways.&nbsp;
First, he taught this vision to the ordinary people (the &ldquo;poor&rdquo;),
healed them, did signs and wonders among them, and loved them.&nbsp;
Second, he called Israel&rsquo;s political, economic and religious
systems (the Jerusalem priestly aristocracy, Pharisees, Sadducees,
land-owners, Herodians) to accountability, demanding that they be
true to God&rsquo;s call to build a society of justice, equitability
and relationality.&nbsp; Third, he built his own alternative
community (the disciples and those who followed him) of those who
lived out &ndash; both while he was alive and after his death and
resurrection -- the kingdom of God that God intended for all
humanity.&nbsp; Finally, when Israel&rsquo;s aristocracy proved so
resistant to his call to accountability that they killed him, Jesus
acted out the atoning nature of Jubilee and, through his
resurrection, created a &ldquo;new Israel&rdquo; to live out what
Israel&rsquo;s leaders had failed to be and do.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is in the light of Jesus&rsquo; announcement in
Luke 4:14-21 that he had been sent by God to bring about the
transformation of the nation and people of Israel into society as God
intended it to be, that we examine Luke 4:21-30.&nbsp; How did the
people who heard Jesus that day in the Nazareth synagogue respond to
Jesus&rsquo; announcement of his mission?&nbsp; Their response would
be prophetic of Israel&rsquo;s response and the world&rsquo;s
response ever since.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>First, there were those who heard Jesus gladly!&nbsp;
Luke tells us that upon Jesus&rsquo; completion of his one-sentence
sermon (vs. 21), &ldquo;All spoke well of him and were amazed at the
gracious words that came from his mouth&rdquo; (vs. 22).&nbsp; For
some people, Jesus&rsquo; proclamation of a jubilee nation was good
news!&nbsp; They responded with enthusiasm to the announcement that
God was once again working through a prophet to return the nation to
a common justice, equitable wealth-sharing and the embrace of each
other and of God.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But, second, there were those who heard Jesus
badly!&nbsp; Others criticized, &ldquo;Is not this Joseph&rsquo;s
son?&rdquo; These words, of course, are a nice way to really say,
&ldquo;Who does this Jesus think he is?&nbsp; How dare he declare to
us that he is God&rsquo;s Anointed One who will bring in God&rsquo;s
shalom kingdom?&nbsp; We know who he is.&nbsp; He grew up here.&nbsp;
We knew him as a boy playing in the streets.&nbsp; We know his father
and mother and brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Who does he think he is,
announcing himself as God&rsquo;s big shot?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
jealousy, anger and rejection is palpable in their response.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Who were those who heard Jesus that Sunday in the
synagogue gladly?&nbsp; And who were those who heard Jesus with
indignation and rage?&nbsp; To answer that question, we must go
further in this text.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Luke tells us, &ldquo;And Jesus said (to the
people), &ldquo;Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the
prophet&rsquo;s hometown.&nbsp; But the truth is, there were many
widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up
three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all
the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at
Zarephath in Sidon.&nbsp; There were also many lepers in Israel in
the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except
Naaman the Syrian&rdquo; (4:24-27).&nbsp; Luke then reports that the
people were enraged at what Jesus had just said, and seek to stone
him to death as a heretic.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he passed through the
midst of them and went on his way&rdquo; (4:30).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What&rsquo;s going on here?&nbsp; There are two ways
of interpreting Jesus&rsquo; enigmatic statement that so enraged the
people.&nbsp; The first interpretation is that Jesus is stressing in
this statement that God is for the Gentile as well as the Jew, and
that such a bold statement flew in the face of Jewish xenophobia, so
that the people became enraged and sought to kill him.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The strength of that argument is found in the fact
that the &ldquo;widow at Zarephath in Sidon&rdquo; was a woman living
in a Gentile enclave and therefore was presumably Gentile herself,
and that &ldquo;Naaman the Syrian&rdquo; was clearly a Gentile.&nbsp;
Jesus seems to be saying that Elijah, Israel&rsquo;s greatest
prophet, came not to save the Israelites but rather a Gentile woman
from famine.&nbsp; And Elisha, Elijah&rsquo;s heir, had come to
cleanse a Gentile of leprosy rather than the lepers in Israel.&nbsp;
Thus, by extension, Jesus was saying that he had come to extend
Jubilee and the gospel to the Gentile world, even if that excluded
Israel.&nbsp; Those who support this argument say that it was Jesus&rsquo;
preference for the Gentiles over the Jews that proved so offensive to
Jesus&rsquo; hearers that they sought to kill him.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>That is possibly a legitimate interpretation of this
passage.&nbsp; But there are problems with it, as well.&nbsp; Chief
among those problems is that there is nothing in the passage up to
that point to suggest that Jesus was really making a polemic for the
Gentiles.&nbsp; The argument seems to come out of nowhere, for up to
this point, Jesus wasn&rsquo;t talking about reaching Gentiles with
the shalom community, but of calling Jews (and especially the Jewish
&ldquo;powers that be&rdquo;) back to the work of building the shalom
community that God had given to all of Israel by giving them the
Law.&nbsp; Gentiles didn&rsquo;t even know about the shalom community
or kingdom of God!&nbsp; Therefore, could there be a more plausible
interpretation of Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;fighting words&rdquo;?&nbsp; I
believe there is.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If Luke&rsquo;s gospel is about anything, it&rsquo;s
about Jesus being for the poor.&nbsp; Luke is the gospel for the
poor.&nbsp; There is more reference to the poor in Luke than any
other gospel.&nbsp; A concern for the poor and how the rich and
powerful respond to the poor makes up the message of almost every
parable in the Gospel of Luke (and Luke has more parables than any
other Gospel account &ndash; see the commentary on last Sunday&rsquo;s
gospel lectionary).&nbsp; And Jesus directly states in this passage
that he has been anointed and called by God &ldquo;to bring good news
to the poor&rdquo; (not to the rich and powerful).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But who are the poor?&nbsp; What is poverty?&nbsp;
When Americans talk about the poor, we almost exclusively understand
poverty as being economic.&nbsp; A poor person is one who lacks
economic resources (for whatever reasons).&nbsp; Our limited
understanding of poverty is caught up in the fact that we have only
one word in our vocabulary to describe the impoverished &ndash; the
&ldquo;poor&rdquo;.&nbsp; But in the Hebrew language, there are nine
words that are translated by the one English word, &ldquo;poor&rdquo;
(<I>ebyon, dal, chelekah, machsor, misken, aneh, ani, rush,
chelkaim)</I>!&nbsp; Each Hebrew word nuances poverty differently, so
that through these words one looks at poverty not simply as being
economic, but also as being powerless, oppressed, exploited,
vulnerable, weak, humble, afflicted, ill, even spiritually ill.</P>
<P>What Jesus was doing in this passage by speaking of Naaman and the
widow of Zarephath was really quite insulting to those who challenged
him in Nazareth.&nbsp; Jesus has just announced to his Jewish
listeners that he has come to &ldquo;bring good news to the poor,
release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, freedom to
the politically oppressed and Jubilee to the nation&rdquo;
(incidentally, notice the diverse ways Jesus defines poverty in his
mission statement).&nbsp; Then, he says in response to the people&rsquo;s
criticism of him, &ldquo;No prophet is accepted in the prophet&rsquo;s
homeland&rdquo;.&nbsp; By saying this, what Jesus was declaring was,
&ldquo;You people don&rsquo;t want to hear that God is about to act
to return our nation to the shalom of political liberation, economic
reversal and sharing of wealth, and spiritual revival.&nbsp; Well, if
you have closed your ears and eyes to what God is about to do through
me, then you will experience as a nation what Israel experienced
under Elijah and Elisha!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>And what had Israel experienced under Elijah and
Elisha?&nbsp; When the nation was in famine, God sent Elijah &ldquo;to
a widow at Zarephath in Sidon&rdquo;, impoverished&nbsp;
economically, policially and socially (because she was a widow) and
because she was a Gentile.&nbsp; <I>She</I> would be receptive, and
therefore would be fed.&nbsp; God sent Elisha to &ldquo;Naaman the
Syrian&rdquo; who, although he was the commanding general of the army
of Syria (and thus very powerful and wealthy) was also impoverished
because he was a leper (thus being both ritualistically unclean to
Jews and physically ostracized by Syrians) and because he was a
Gentile (spiritually poor).&nbsp; But, he too was receptive to what
God could do for him through Elisha, and therefore was healed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The offense was not simply that the widow and Naaman
were Gentiles and yet seemed preferred by God.&nbsp; It was that
Naaman and the widow had &ldquo;ears to hear what the Spirit is
saying&rdquo; and &ldquo;eyes to see&rdquo;, and the Jews did not!&nbsp;
In this passage, I believe that it wasn&rsquo;t simply the
Gentileness of Jesus&rsquo; examples that caused such offense to his
Jewish critics.&nbsp; It was Jesus&rsquo; declaration that those in
his hometown were not open to what God was about to do through Jesus,
because it didn&rsquo;t fit into their understanding of the world as
they intended it to be.&nbsp; Should they not have been thrilled that
the poor would receive good news, that captives would be freed, that
the blind would see, that the oppressed would be set free, that
poverty would be eliminated?&nbsp; But they weren&rsquo;t, because
they had eyes that saw not, ears that heard not!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So who were those who criticized and belittled Jesus
on the occasion of his first sermon?&nbsp; And who were those who
&ldquo;drove him out of their town&rdquo; and sought to hurl him off
the cliff to kill him and thus &ldquo;shut his mouth&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Why, they were like all the fine, upstanding, church-going people
everywhere!&nbsp; They were the pillars of Nazareth, the leaders of
the synagogue, the wealthy supporters of the synagogue, the
upstanding citizens of Nazareth.&nbsp; And the last thing they wanted
was someone &ndash; even a homeboy -- who would come along turning
everything upside down and proclaiming a reversal of their society.&nbsp;
And so, at the very beginning of Jesus&rsquo; ministry, they sought
to eliminate him!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;But he passed through the midst of them and
went on his way&rdquo; (4:30)!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Jeremiah 1:4-10.</B></U>&nbsp; As Jesus
announced his call to bring God&rsquo;s Kingdom to the world (but
especially to Israel), so in the Old Testament Lesson for the 4<SUP>th</SUP>
Sunday in Epiphany, Jeremiah is also called.&nbsp; And that call has
marked similarity to the calls of both Jesus and of Moses.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The account begins with God&rsquo;s direct call to
Jeremiah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
saying, &lsquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before
you were born I consecrated you.&nbsp; I appointed you a prophet to
the nations&rsquo;&rdquo; (1:4-5).&nbsp; Like Jesus and Moses,
Jeremiah has been chosen by God to his mission even before he was
born, while he was still in his mother&rsquo;s womb.&nbsp; Just as
Jesus was &ldquo;to save his people from their sins&rdquo;, and just
as Moses had been chosen and protected by God at his birth (Exodus
2), so Jeremiah was called before birth to be &ldquo;a prophet to the
nations&rdquo;.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jeremiah&rsquo;s work was not only to impact Israel,
but the other nations of the world as well.&nbsp; And he was elected
and chosen by God before birth for this task.&nbsp; Thus, he was not
a self-appointed messenger, for Jeremiah had no choice in the
matter.&nbsp; He was set apart even before birth for this God-chosen
mission.&nbsp; That reality is the ground for Jeremiah&rsquo;s
prophetic standing. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Like Moses (Exod. 3:11; 4:1, 10), Jeremiah resists
his call.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I said, &lsquo;Ah, Lord God!&nbsp; Truly
I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy&rsquo; (Jer. 1:6)&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Jeremiah reminds God that he is only a mere lad; how dare he
represent God before his elders?&nbsp; Further, he does not know how
to speak eloquently or clearly; how can he speak God&rsquo;s words?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jeremiah sounds very similar to Moses, who also demurred his call &ndash;
and with the very same excuse of being slow-of-speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But God refuses to take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an
answer.&nbsp; He reminded Moses, &ldquo;Who gives speech to mortals?&nbsp;
Who makes them mute or deaf, seeing or blind?&nbsp; Is it not I, the
Lord?&nbsp; Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what
you are to speak&rdquo; (Exod. 4:11-12).&nbsp; So God also reminded
Jeremiah, &ldquo;Do not say, &lsquo;I am only a boy&rsquo;; for you
shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I
command you.&nbsp; Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to
deliver you&rdquo; (Jer. 1:7-8).&nbsp; God promises to be with both
men, and to put God&rsquo;s words into their mouths.&nbsp; God will
not let either the one who is to be Israel&rsquo;s Law-giver nor he
who is to be Israel&rsquo;s prophet to negotiate their way out of
God&rsquo;s sure and certain call upon their lives.&nbsp; They are
God&rsquo;s chosen, and so they will do the work to which they have
been called.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Then, God presents to Jeremiah quite clearly the
nature and extent of his call.&nbsp; He touches Jeremiah&rsquo;s
mouth (just as he had Isaiah&rsquo;s in Isa. 6:6-7), and then says to
him, &ldquo;Now I have put my words in your mouth.&nbsp; See, today I
appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull
down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant&rdquo;
(1:9-10).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>God&rsquo;s call to us may not always come as good
news!&nbsp; It may be overwhelming and even risky news.&nbsp; It may
be frightening and intimidating news.&nbsp; And it may be welcomed
news to God&rsquo;s people, even though it may have great demands
that it will lay upon them.&nbsp; Good news may be contained within
it, but it may not be solely good news.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>God tells Jeremiah that he has been chosen by God
before his birth to proclaim God&rsquo;s word to both Israel and the
larger world.&nbsp; And as he carries out his ministry, he will be
both destroyer and builder, for he will &ldquo;pluck up&rdquo;, &ldquo;pull
down&rdquo;, &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; and &ldquo;overthrow&rdquo; the
systems of the nation, as well as &ldquo;build and plant&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Likewise, Moses may &ldquo;set my people free&rdquo;, but to do so,
he will have to confront Pharaoh and humble both him and the Egyptian
empire.&nbsp; Further, Jesus may &ldquo;bring good news to the poor,
release to the captives, sight to the blind, set the oppressed free&rdquo;
and proclaim &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jubilee-time&rdquo;!&nbsp; But he is
also &ldquo;destined for the falling and the rising of many in
Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed &ndash; and a sword
will pierce his mother&rsquo;s soul too&rdquo; (Luke 2:34-35).&nbsp;
So, God&rsquo;s call may not always be good news, but it will be
transforming and restorative news!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This, then, is Jeremiah&rsquo;s call &ndash; for he
has been called by God to do that particular work God has for him to
do, like Moses before him and Jesus after him.&nbsp; And you &ndash;
what about you?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Psalm 71</B></U> is the psalm for the 4<SUP>th</SUP>
Sunday after Epiphany.&nbsp; It is a prayer for lifelong protection
and help.&nbsp; Some of its stanzas are particularly noteworthy.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never
be put to shame.&nbsp; In your righteousness deliver me and rescue
me; incline your ear to me and save me.&nbsp; Be to me a rock of
refuge, a strong fortress, to save me, for you are my rock and my
fortress&rdquo; (71:1-3).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This is a moving cry for the support, sustenance and
strength of God in the Psalmist&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It becomes
particularly poignant, however, when he compares his youth and old
age.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;Upon you I have leaned from my birth; it was
you who took me from my mother&rsquo;s womb. . .&nbsp; Do not cast me
off in the time of old age; do not forsake me when my strength is
spent&rdquo; (vss. 6a, 9).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>God was faithful and clearly present in the
Psalmist&rsquo;s birth and earliest years.&nbsp; Yet he feels God&rsquo;s
absence now in his final years, and therefore calls upon God to be
present to him now.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But God becomes present to him, even as he prays.&nbsp;
Therefore, the psalm ends with a shout of joy and of praise to God.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;My lips will shout for joy when I sing
praises to you; my soul also, which you have rescued.&nbsp; All day
long my tongue will talk of your righteous help, for those who tried
to do me harm have been put to shame, and disgraced&rdquo;
(71:23-24).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>I Corinthians 13:1-13</B></U> is Paul&rsquo;s
famous love poem.&nbsp; It is a beautiful statement of the nature of
selfless love, and especially Christian love.&nbsp; But it has a very
strategic place in this letter to the Corinthian Church.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>As developed in the commentary on last Sunday&rsquo;s
epistle lesson, the Corinthian Church was divided into four unequal
parties &ndash; the Pauline, Apollos, Petrine and Christ parties.&nbsp;
Each of the parties had its own agenda for the Corinthian Church, and
was pushing that agenda with no compromise and with no inclusion of
the other parties.&nbsp; The result was a &ldquo;superiority complex&rdquo;
on the part of some and a sense of being marginalized and powerless
on the part of others.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>A crucial part of that struggle had been around the
&ldquo;spiritual gifts&rdquo; of prophecies, tongues, and knowledge
(knowledge not being accumulated information or wisdom, but special
insight and discernment given by the Holy Spirit). &nbsp;In the
previous chapter, Paul had argued that these spiritual gifts are
given by God to the church to build up and edify the church, and to
better equip it for outreach to the world.&nbsp; Those gifts are
distributed as God chooses throughout the church (not exclusively to
a given &ldquo;party&rdquo;), and exist for the strengthening and
edifying of everyone.&nbsp; Therefore, Paul advices the Corinthians,
embrace the gift that God has placed within you, use it for the good
of the entire church, and do not covet the gifts of others.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But Paul takes his readers one step further.&nbsp;
He urges them to embrace the gifts within them.&nbsp; And be then
states, &ldquo;And I will show you a still more excellent way&rdquo;
(12:31b).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>That &ldquo;more excellent way&rdquo; is the gift of
love &ndash; the one gift that every member of the church needs to
embrace.&nbsp; Thus, Paul begins his great chapter on love as the
supreme gift of each Christian &ndash; a love for one another that
excludes no one and embraces everyone.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I Corinthians 13:1-3 begins the poem by stressing
that love is the supreme gift God awakens in every Christian.&nbsp;
If one has prophetic powers, understands all knowledge, speaks in
heavenly language but does not treat brother and sister Christians as
loved siblings, then he is nothing more than &ldquo;a noisy gong or a
clanging cymbal&rdquo;.&nbsp; He is worthless!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then moves on in verses 4-7 to describe what he
means by the word &ldquo;love&rdquo;.&nbsp; It is important to
recognize that those who spoke Greek at the time of Paul
distinguished between three types of love &ndash; erotic love,
companionable love or friendship, and self-giving love; so it was
crucial that Paul define here what he meant by love.&nbsp; The kind
of love that the Corinthian Christians are to practice toward one
another, Paul declares, is self-giving or Godly love.&nbsp; It is a
love that is patient with one another, kind, not envious, not
boastful, not arrogant or rude.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t insist on its
own way.&nbsp; It is not irritable or resentful, doesn&rsquo;t
rejoice in the exposure of wrong in other people but believes the
best about them, hopes for the best in people, and endures
persecution, condemnation or ridicule.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then compares and contrasts love with other
virtues (vss. 8-10).&nbsp; All the &ldquo;gifts of the Spirit&rdquo;,
Paul contends, are temporary gifts.&nbsp; They are given to
strengthen the church and its world mission during this period of
transition between the first and the second comings of Christ.&nbsp;
Whether one speaks of prophecy, knowledge or tongues, they will all
&ldquo;come to an end&rdquo;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But love &ndash; God&rsquo;s love reflected through
us &ndash; is another matter entirely.&nbsp; Love will never end.&nbsp;
Love will be as much in God&rsquo;s kingdom when it comes in its
totality as it is needed today.&nbsp; It is the one virtue given by
God that is everlasting.&nbsp; Therefore, it makes sense to
concentrate on nurturing this gift within ourselves and each other.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then concludes his poem, &ldquo;When I was a
child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like
a child; when I became an adult I put an end to childish ways.&nbsp;
For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to
face.&nbsp; Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as
I have been fully known.&nbsp; And now faith, hope, and love abide,
these three.&nbsp; And the greatest of these is love&rdquo;
(13:11-13).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul uses two metaphors here to communicate his
concern: the metaphor of child and adult, and of seeing either a
reflection or the reality.&nbsp; Living centered in and boasting of
our gifts is like living as a child; it is childish and is not the
stuff of mature Christians.&nbsp; Living centered in love for God&rsquo;s
people and the world is the stance of the mature Christian.&nbsp;
Likewise, living centered in ourselves and our own gifts, and living
in a party spirit is like viewing life through a mirror (a mirror in
Roman times was made of burnished bronze and thus gave both a dim and
distorted reflection of the person); living in love is like seeing a
person face-to-face.&nbsp; Thus, to settle for satisfaction with
one&rsquo;s gifts is to settle for second-place.&nbsp; To strive
after that &ldquo;more excellent way&rdquo; of Christian love is to
strive after the very essence of Christianity.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thus, Paul ends, &ldquo;faith, hope and love abide,
these three; and the greatest of these is love&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Authentic Christian faith comes down to three ingredients: a right
relationship with God (&ldquo;<I>faith</I>&rdquo;), <I>hope</I> that
God is indeed the ground of our and humanity&rsquo;s very being, and
<I>love</I>.&nbsp; All three are crucial, but it is love that is
eternal, for love is the indispensable characteristic of authentic
Christian life.&nbsp; Therefore, Paul is saying to the Corinthian
Christians, do not long after the gifts of the Spirit; long after the
exhibition of love in your life.&nbsp; For you can exhibit only what
you are allowing God to grow in you &ndash; God&rsquo;s love for the
world and for all who name the name of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>JEREMIAH 1:4-10. How does God call someone to be God&rsquo;s
spokesperson? Is it always a direct vocal summons such that heard by
as Moses, or Samuel, or Isaiah, or Jeremiah &ndash; a mystical
experience which comes to very few? Or is there sometimes a less
dramatic way: a still, small voice within; or a gentle suggestion
from a friend; or an inner desire expressed in a wordless prayer of
commitment and a deep, reassuring confirmation that this is what God
also desires? God has as many ways of calling as there are those whom
God has chosen to lead.</P>
<P>This passage tells of a classic example of the direct call to a
prophet for his special mission. As the prophet himself reported the
experience, Yahweh intervened in the life of the young Jeremiah with
a summons. &ldquo;The word of the Lord came to me saying, &hellip;.&rdquo;
(vs.4) The divine message revealed that Yahweh had intended this role
for Jeremiah from before his birth. Although Jeremiah felt
predestined, he also felt unsuited for the vocation to which Yahweh
had called him. That too is a common reaction to what must have been
a very intense experience.</P>
<P>For anyone who has had a similar experience, Jeremiah&rsquo;s
protests have a familiar ring to them. We all can think of every
conceivable reason not to accept such a call. He didn&rsquo;t know
how to speak. He was too young. These days, we might say, &ldquo;I am
too old.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I am too busy raising my family.&rdquo; Or
&ldquo;I am too busy saving for my retirement. Actually, he was
afraid. And so are we. That was what Yahweh reassured him about most
(vs. 8).</P>
<P>Yahweh not only called, but also equipped Jeremiah for his
vocation. He received promises that Yahweh would give him the words
to utter and to be with him whenever he was commanded to speak
(vss.7-8). He would become &ldquo;the mouthpiece of the Almighty,&rdquo;
as William Sanday described the prophet&rsquo;s vocation. Then Yahweh
acted to ordain him by &ldquo;touching his mouth,&rdquo; thus giving
him effective powers of speech. Isaiah had a similar experience (Isa.
6:5-6) Be warned, however, vocation and ordination today do not
guarantee effectiveness in preaching.</P>
<P>The prophet would need all of these gifts because his task was to
pronounce God&rsquo;s judgment, not only on Israel but on other
nations too. His mission had much wider implications, both negative
and positive. It reached beyond Israel to the nations (vs.10). This
happened in a time of great disruption when the power of the great
Assyrian empire had declined to the point where it was in its death
throes. The kingdom of Judah had been ruled by Manasseh (697 ? or
687-642), a vassal of Assyria. He had been the longest reigning and
the most reviled monarch, according to the Deuteronomists, because of
his love for syncretist religious practices. Idols and worship of
foreign gods had been introduced into Judea and Jerusalem rivaling
and corrupting the worship of Yahweh. Vassal states like Babylon and
Media quickly filled the political vacuum left by the decline of the
Assyrian empire.</P>
<P>It is thought that Jeremiah&rsquo;s ministry began the very year
in which Assurbanipal, the last of the Assyrian emperors (669-627
BCE) died. That could well have been the incident which occasioned
his call. From this brief discussion of historical events, we may
conclude that the details of vs.10 were written after the fact,
reflecting what had already taken place.</P>
<P>Jeremiah&rsquo;s active ministry is thought to have extended over
the next 40 years to 586 BCE. In that year Jerusalem fell to the
Babylonians and a great many of the leaders of Israel were marched
away to exile. Jeremiah was not among them, but was carried away to
Egypt by a group of refugees. However, some scholars doubt that his
ministry began before 612 or 609 BCE because there is a gap of some
20 years in biographical information. This is so despite the fact
that no other prophetic book includes so much biographical data. Some
regard the date of 627 BCE as the time of his birth, which gives
poignancy to his protest about his youth in vs.6.</P>
<P><STRONG><BR>PSALM 71:1-6. </STRONG>In some respects, this psalm
does not conform to the traditional style of a lament with its
sequence of appeal, complaint, petition and vow of thanksgiving, such
as we find in Ps. 56. Here we have a sick, fearful and depressed old
man (vss. 9, 18) who appears to have reached the end of his
resources. He feels that God has all but deserted him. He makes
several urgent appeals to God for deliverance from unnamed enemies.
Yet, throughout his prayer, he prefaces his appeals by confessing his
trust in God as his only refuge and hope (vs. 3).</P>
<P>We must conclude that the psalm was composed at relatively late
date. It draws on material found in other parts of the Psalter: vss.
1-3 = 31:1-3a; vs. 6 = 22:10, etc. Be that as it may, the psalm still
expresses the intensive search of the lonely and distressed soul for
the assurance and hope of a living relationship with God in the
utmost extremities of life.</P>
<P>Could this not also be the prayer of those who even now endure
unexpected natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis? And
what of those many millions who flee for their lives in terror caused
by war only to face starvation and death in refugee camps? Are there
not also many single parent families or elderly people, ill, alone
and threatened with being forced out of their homes because no one
cares about them and governments have withdrawn support for the most
vulnerable of this richest society ever in human history? The
profound sense of justice implicit is so much of Hebrew prophetic
literature comes to the fore in this psalmist&rsquo;s lament.</P>
<P><STRONG><BR>1 CORINTHIANS 13: 1-13.</STRONG> Paul&rsquo;s hymn to
love remains one of the great pieces of poetry in any language. It
has universal application &ndash; from marriage and family life to
all forms of human relationships, individual and corporate. Yet there
is a firmness about it that denies all sentimentality.</P>
<P>This love is more than words or even noble, sacrificial actions
(vss.1-3). It goes straight to the heart of the problems of human
communication and the fractious habits that drive us apart:
impatience, unkindness, envy, boasting, arrogance, rudeness,
selfishness, irritability, resentment, deliberate wrongdoing, deceit
and dishonesty (vss. 4-7). Paul declares his unequivocal conviction
that love can overcome all of these human failings common to us all.
This should surely still form an important element of every marriage
ceremony and the heart of every pre-marital interview for couples
asking the church to bless their union. Conflict resolution programs
never had a better means of achieving success than following these
few verses.</P>
<P>For those who doubt that this approach to life can be effective,
Paul has a special word of counsel: this is how mature people relate
to each other. (vss. 8-12) There is no other way to settle disputes
such as those he had encountered among the disciples in Corinth. Why
not in our homes, our towns, our country and our world too?</P>
<P>Enthralling as this poem may be, Paul wrote explicitly to the
Corinthian disciple community &ndash; and to us in our context right
now. Some may feel that while this may be the ideal formula for life
in the Shalom of God, it is not very practical for life in the real
world. If we are disciples of Jesus Christ, if we are indeed &ldquo;his
body,&rdquo; then this is the way we are to live here and now. This
is the way he lived in the real world, costly though it was. This is
what the cross means: Love that lays down its life for the world
through every-day human relationships.</P>
<P>The Greek word translated &ldquo;love&rdquo; throughout this
passage is <EM>agap&eacute;</EM>. Many treatises have been written
comparing this word to other Greek words all translated into English
as &ldquo;love.&rdquo; <EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Dictionary of the
Bible</EM> has a nine page article on this word entitled &ldquo;Love
in the NT.&rdquo; It was written by a man I knew well and who more
than once tested my love for him as a teacher and colleague in
ministry, the late Professor George Johnston, one-time professor of
NT at Emmanuel College, Toronto, then later at United Theological
College and McGill University, Montreal. He concluded his exhaustive
study by saying that this love had taken a human face in Jesus of
Nazareth and had spoken by a human voice to and for all the scattered
children of God. &ldquo;Love had reached down from God to man, that
man might rise up to enjoy life in God forever.&rdquo; Acerbic though
he was in his criticism of less than adequate scholarship, Prof.
Johnson has a genuine pastoral care for his students which
exemplified the word love.<BR><STRONG><BR>LUKE 4:21-30.</STRONG> So
what does one say after one has told the audience in one&rsquo;s home
town that they are witnessing the inauguration of the new age of
God&rsquo;s rule in all of life through all the world? The message
Deutero-Isaiah had delivered was simple, &ldquo;Your God reigns.&rdquo;
Jesus had come to implement that reign of God in his home town, among
his own people.</P>
<P>The initial reaction to Jesus in Nazareth was quite favourable.
Patronizing too. &ldquo;Fine fellow, that boy. Joseph the carpenter&rsquo;s
son, isn&rsquo;t he? His widowed mother must be proud of him. He&rsquo;ll
go far.&rdquo;</P>
<P>That wasn&rsquo;t good enough for Jesus. He knew they hadn&rsquo;t
really heard him at all. He would have none of it. So he made them
listen by challenging his hometown audience to believe in him and his
mission to the world. He had not come home to do miracles like they
had heard of him performing in Capernaum a few kilometres down the
road by the Sea of Galilee. And he wasn&rsquo;t there to make them
think well of him; or to make them feel good as the preferred and
privileged people, good Israelites all. Like Elijah and Elisha, he
had come to minister to outsiders too.</P>
<P>Here Luke, ever mindful of his Gentile audience, lets his
universalism stand out clearly. G.B. Caird wrote in his study of
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel: &ldquo;The stories of Elijah and Elisha should,
indeed, have taught them that with God charity begins wherever there
is found human need to call it forth and faith to receive it,
irrespective of class or race.&rdquo; (Caird, G.B. <EM>Saint Luke.</EM>
The Pelican New Testament Commentaries, 1963.) As Luke presents him,
Jesus had a much wider vision than the Jewish community in the small
mountain village in Galilee from which he had come.</P>
<P>George Santayana once said that those who cannot remember the past
are condemned to repeat it. After a century of the most destructive
conflicts ever based on ideological rivalries between competing
empires, we have entered a new century with the prospect of ethnic
and religious conflicts within many smaller nations. Our 24-hour
television news broadcasts feature violence and death occurring
wherever the far-ranging eye of a television camera will reach. The
problem is that when we see these tragic events, we fail to recognize
that our own attitudes toward those who are &ldquo;not like us&rdquo;
are being deeply challenged. For example, whenever we ask someone who
has a skin colour different from ours, &ldquo;Where do you come
from?&rdquo; we expose our own racial prejudices. Or when we tell a
joke that pigeon-holes people because of their particular accent or
country of origin, we express the narrowness of our own minds.</P>
<P>That is exactly what happened when Jesus recalled the stories
about the widow of Sidon and Naaman the Syrian. Both of them weren&rsquo;t
even Israelites, but had been ministered to by two of Israel&rsquo;s
great prophets. &ldquo;Open your eyes!&rdquo; Jesus was saying to his
neighbours in Nazareth. &ldquo;The world is bigger than you imagine.
The God you claim to believe in is far too small. God doesn&rsquo;t
just favour Israelites like you and me. God&rsquo;s love extends to
those who are most vulnerable, the most oppressed, the outsiders, the
most in need.&rdquo;</P>
<P>My friend, Jim Taylor, wrote in his <EM>Soft Edges</EM> column on
the Internet: &ldquo;Canadians have been more subtle about our
prejudices. We&rsquo;re only now coming to realize the second class
status accorded to our aboriginal peoples. And our immigrants. Our
women. Our elderly&hellip;. Racism&rsquo;s roots lie in one group&rsquo;s
conviction of God-given superiority over another group, simply by
belonging to that group. By extension, any member of the dominant
group can feel superior to any member of the victim group.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Whether it was the way he said it or the unspoken implications of
what Jesus said, the good citizens of Nazareth were enraged. They ran
him out of town. Wouldn&rsquo;t we still do so? Don&rsquo;t we,
though perhaps in more subtle ways?</P>
