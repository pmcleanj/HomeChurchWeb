</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born
or began his ministry in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded
Assyria as the dominant power in the Middle East. He was a witness to
the return to worship of the Lord (instituted by the Judean king
Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death in battle in 609), the return
of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon captured Jerusalem in
587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be a prophet to
Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political and
religious convulsions. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Jeremiah 1:4-10</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The people of Israel have strayed from God&rsquo;s ways. In the
late 600s BC, King Josiah guided the people back to godliness by
removing all traces of foreign worship and by making Jerusalem the
one place of worship. Jeremiah played a key role in Josiah&rsquo;s
reforms.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The word of the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>&rdquo; is a
characteristic expression in this book: the message Jeremiah
proclaims is God&rsquo;s word. The Hebrew word <EM>yashar</EM>,
translated &ldquo;formed&rdquo; (v. 5), is a technical term for
<EM>created</EM>; a potter <EM>forms</EM> clay into pottery. Recall
Genesis 2:7-8, where God <EM>forms</EM> man. The idea that God
himself forms a child in its mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;womb&rdquo; (v. 5)
was accepted. God has known Jeremiah since his first moment of
existence &ndash; both intellectually and in his capacity for action.
Even before that, God dedicated him, separated him for his purposes
(&ldquo;consecrated&rdquo;), to serve him. Jeremiah is but a youth
(&ldquo;boy&rdquo;, v. 6 &ndash; probably in his early twenties),
without experience and authority, but God will give him all necessary
support. (Moses&rsquo; reaction to God&rsquo;s command to lead the
people of Israel was similar.) God commissions Jeremiah through the
symbolic action of touching his mouth (v. 9). In vv. 5 and 10, the
&ldquo;nations&rdquo; and &ldquo;kingdoms&rdquo; are most likely
Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt and Judah: the history of Israel is
intertwined with that of the whole Near East. Jeremiah&rsquo;s
mission is to do away with corruption and ungodliness, and to promote
ethical conduct and godliness. God&rsquo;s instructions to the
prophet continue in v. 17. Jeremiah is to be ready for action (&ldquo;gird
up your loins&rdquo;); he is to respond promptly to God&rsquo;s
commands. Mighty as the ungodly are, he is not to flinch, but to
&ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to them; if he fails to do so, God will
&ldquo;break&rdquo; him. Even though the deviants will fight against
him and persecute him, he will prevail, &ldquo;for I am with you ...
to deliver you&rdquo; (v. 19).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4>The Call</H4>
<P>Jeremiah preached before and during the fall of Jerusalem to
Babylon. According to tradition, he was exiled to Egypt and died as a
martyr.</P>
<P>This passage describes the call of Jeremiah. Like many of the
other prophets, Jeremiah is called by God in four steps: 1)
commission of the prophet by God, 2) objection of the prophet, 3)
God's reassurance to the prophet, and 4) God's sign to the prophet.
Verses 4-5 describe the first step of the process, the commission of
Jeremiah. Verses 17-19 refer to God's reassurance and sign (steps 3 &amp;
4) that Jeremiah was given in a vision.</P>
<P>Jeremiah's call speaks to our call as Christians. We are all
called by God from the moment of our creation in the womb for one
purpose: life with God. Witness through our words and actions is our
&quot;yes&quot; to God's call. While we might not be called to be an
international sign like Jeremiah, we are called to make a difference
in our world. [4-5]</P>
<P>Witness does require courage (i.e., girding one's loins) and
honesty. We might shrink away from the demands of witness, like
Jeremiah was tempted to do. But as he promised Jeremiah, God will not
leave us devastated. Indeed, God will strengthen us for the fight, as
he did Jeremiah, as long as we depend on him, for He is our
salvation. [17-19]</P>
<P><I>How has God's call challenged you to reach out to others? Has
that outreach ever been rejected? What happened?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Psalms</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 71:1-6</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The psalmist finds sanctuary in his trust in God; even so, he asks
God to be his reference point (&ldquo;rock&rdquo;, v. 3) and strength
in life, to rescue him from &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; (v. 4) and ungodly
people. He has trusted in God &ldquo;from my youth&rdquo; (v. 5) and,
as v. 18 shows, he is now in &ldquo;old age&rdquo; and has &ldquo;gray
hairs&rdquo;. God has supported him throughout his life (&ldquo;from
my birth&rdquo;, v. 6). Note the belief that God caused him to be
born. From vv. 7-10, we learn that his enemies consider him so evil
that they avoid him <EM>like the plague</EM>: a &ldquo;portent&rdquo;
(v. 7) was always evil. The psalmist especially seeks God&rsquo;s
help now that he no longer has the strength to defend himself; his
foes believe that God has forsaken him: may they be disgraced and
scorned (v. 13). He will always proclaim how God acts with integrity
and tell of the many times God has rescued him. God has taught him
throughout his life (v. 17). A musician, he will praise God on the
&ldquo;harp&rdquo; (v. 22) and the &ldquo;lyre&rdquo;, and by singing
God&rsquo;s praises. He is confident that God will help him.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1 Corinthians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the
land route from the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An
industrial and ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the
arts. Its inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul
answers two letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and
internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded.
Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57
AD.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>1 Corinthians 13:1-13</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>In response to a letter, Paul has further instructed the
Christians at Corinth about the gifts of the Spirit. It seems that
they value the gift of tongues too highly. Three groups of gifted
people are especially important &ndash; &ldquo;apostles&rdquo;
(12:28, spreading the good news), &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; (telling new
insights into the faith) and &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; (of the faith) &ndash;
but now he says that the most important gift is love, the expression
in the community of Christ&rsquo;s love for us. The statements in vv.
1-3 are all on the same model. Whatever is spoken, if said without
love, is like the clatter of pagan worship. (At the time, rabbis
debated what language &ldquo;angels&rdquo; spoke.) Prophecy is
important but without love of one&rsquo;s fellows it is &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;
(v. 2). Even helping others to the extent of self-denial is worthless
without love.</P>
<P>In vv. 4-7, he tells his readers how their behaviour contrasts
with the qualities of this love: it is the reverse of their proud,
contemptuous, divisive attitudes. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; (v. 6) is
integrity, ethical living. Love, he says, is different from God&rsquo;s
other gifts (v. 8); unlike them (&ldquo;prophecies&rdquo;, &ldquo;tongues&rdquo;,
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;), it never ends: it is transcendent,
continuing beyond this era, into the time when we will be one with
Christ. In the present age, all that we do through the Spirit is
&ldquo;partial&rdquo; (v. 10), incomplete, immature. <EM>Mirrors</EM>
then, being polished metal, gave a fuzzy image, but in the age to
come (&ldquo;then&rdquo;, v. 12) we will see God clearly. We will
know him fully, as God knows Paul now. &ldquo;Love&rdquo; (v. 13) is
the &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; because it will continue unchanged, while
&ldquo;faith&rdquo; will become <EM>sight</EM> and &ldquo;hope&rdquo;
will become <EM>certainty</EM>.</P>

<H4>What Defines &quot;Church&quot;</H4>
<P><B>Popular Translation</B></P>
<P><B>12:31 Always desire the best gifts from God. Better yet, I will
show you the way.</B></P>
<P><B>13:1 If I speak well and talk the way angels do, yet I don't
love others, I just like a loud gong or crashing cymbal. 2 If I speak
prophecies, know everything God knows, and move mountains with my
great faith, yet I don't love others, I'm completely worthless. 3 If
I give everything I have to the poor and give my body over to my
persecutors just so I can brag, yet I don't love others, I don't gain
a thing.</B></P>
<P><B>4 Love is patient and kind. It's not jealous. Love doesn't brag
or get full of itself. 5 It doesn't act in shameful ways. It's not
selfish. It doesn't get others angry or stir up thoughts of past
hurts. 6 It doesn't celebrate others' sins. But it does celebrate
when others are faithful. 7 It puts up with everything, trusts God in
everything, hopes in everything God does, and bears everything that
comes its way.</B></P>
<P><B>8 Love will always be there. Our prophecies, our fancy words,
and the things we know will fade away. 9 Our knowledge and prophecies
are simply not complete. 10 But, when Jesus comes at the end of time,
we will know everything. 11 When I was a baby, I spoke like a baby,
understood the world like a baby does, and had the brains of a baby.
But, when I grew up, I stopped doing all the things I did as a baby.
12 Now we look into a dark mirror. But, soon, we will see everything
face to face. Now, I don't know everything. Soon, I will know
everything, in the same way God knows me. 13 Faith in God, hope in
his promises, and love for others will always be there. But, love is
the most important of them all.</B></P>
<P><B>Literal Translation</B></P>
<P><B>12:31 Be jealous for the greater grace-filled gifts.</B></P>
<P><B>Still, I will show you a far superior way.</B></P>
<P><B>13:1 If I should speak in the tongues of men and angels, and I
should not have love, I have become a resonating (piece of ) copper
or a crashing cymbal. 2 If ever I should prophesy, and I should know
all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have complete faith
to change (the location of) mountains, and I should not have love, I
am nothing. 3 If I should pass out my possessions (to the poor) and
if I should hand over my body so that I can brag, but I should not
have love, I gain nothing.</B></P>
<P><B>4 Love is patient; love is kind; (it) is not jealous; [love]
does not promote itself, is not puffed up, 5 is not shameful, does
not seek for itself, does not provoke, does not reason evil, 6 does
not rejoice with unrighteous (acts), but rejoices in the truth. 7
(It) bears all, trusts all, hopes all, endures all.</B></P>
<P><B>8 Love never fails. But with prophecies, they will be
abolished. With tongues, they will cease. With knowledge, it will be
abolished. 9 For we know only partially and we prophecy only
partially. 10 When the end should come, the partial will be
abolished. 11 When I was an infant, I was speaking as an infant, I
was understanding as an infant, I was reasoning as an infant. When I
have become a man, I have abolished the (things) of an infant. 12 For
now we look into a mirror as a riddle, but then, face to face. Now I
know partially, then I will know exactly, just as I am also known
exactly. 13 Now faith, hope, and love remain. But the greatest of
these is love.</B></P>
<P>13:1 &quot;tongues of men and angels&quot; &quot;Tongues&quot; in
this sense referred both to the ability to speak foreign languages
and eloquence. In a culture that communicated news by a town crier,
that spread the faith through missionaries who stood on street
corners to evangelize to gathered crowds, rhetorical skills were
highly prized.</P>
<P>Our media culture also prizes these gifts. Newscasters, talk show
hosts, and other public personalities work on delivery and public
presence. The multi-lingual, multi-cultural personality can reach to
audiences across borders. The gifts of eloquence and language are
still very desirable. But, by themselves, they create two-dimensional
personalities.</P>
<P>13:2 &quot;If ever I should prophesy, and I should know all
mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have complete faith to
change (the location) of mountains&quot; Compare these gifts to those
listed in 12:8-10. Knowledge was listed second, faith was third on
the list, prophecy was fifth. Notice that the first gift in 12:8
(wisdom) was missing from this verse. Paul inferred a lack of wisdom
among the bickering Corinthians (the most highly prized value in
Greek culture). And, he inferred that even the fullness of a
particular gift was not, by itself, sufficient.</P>
<P>13:1-2 &quot;love&quot; is Greek is &quot;agape.&quot; &quot;Love&quot;
in this sense is charity. Charity was the glue that held the
Christian community together. Charity was missing in the turf wars
the community experienced.</P>
<P>13:7 &quot;(It) bears all, trusts all, hopes all, endures all.&quot;
This forms a quasi &quot;A-B-A&quot; structure with the language of
endurance (&quot;A&quot;) surrounding and highlighting faith and hope
(&quot;B&quot;).</P>
<P>13:8 &quot;only partially&quot; is literally &quot;out of a
portion.&quot; The word can also mean &quot;imperfect,&quot; even
&quot;immature.&quot;</P>
<P>Chapter Thirteen of First Corinthians is a favorite for wedding
ceremonies. Yet, I wonder if the couple would choose this &quot;ode&quot;
to love if they really knew the underlining intent of Paul.</P>
<P>In the midst of Paul's diatribe against cliques that fought for
turf in the Corinthian church, he presented the ideal virtue of the
Christian community: charity. But he framed the ideal in a polemical
way.</P>
<P>First, he looked at the spiritual gifts that were the bragging
points of his opponents: tongues, claims of spiritual knowledge, and
prophecy. To this list he added almsgiving and self-sacrifice. While
these were all admirable, they did not, in themselves, evangelize or
promote the growth of the community. In and of themselves, they were
useless.</P>
<P>Second, Paul described the substance of charity in a quasi &quot;A-B-A&quot;
structure. The positives (&quot;A&quot;) highlighted the negative
(&quot;B&quot;) Charity was patient and kind. It endures the negative
with faith and hope.</P>
<P>Charity was not the activity of his opponents that spread their
agenda. They promoted themselves, acted with arrogance, even engaged
in shameful activities (backdoor politics?). As they sought personal
gain, they provoked others, instilled animosities, and celebrated
when others &quot;lost face.&quot; These were not the hallmarks of
Christian community.</P>
<P>Third, against these attitudes and activities, Paul makes the most
remarkable statement: charity never fails. This self-giving virtue
would survive the last day and would define the Kingdom. When all
other spiritual gifts faded away with the coming of the Lord, charity
would remain. Prophecy and spiritual knowledge were, by nature,
incomplete (imperfect and, so, lacking maturity). Their misuse could
(and was) tearing apart the community. Charity, by nature, could
never do this. Implicitly, charity could cause prophecy and spiritual
insight to grow. The reverse was not always true.</P>
<P>Paul concluded with his famous hierarchy of the theological
virtues: faith, hope, and charity. The greatest was charity. It
defined the ideal of the Church. It defined life in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Like the Corinthians, we share the human frailties of turf
possession, social climbing, gossip, obsession with control...
Sometimes, I think parish life is defined by these sins. But, as many
times as I see the negative, I see three times the positive. Charity
does live in the community. As bad as we can be, we are challenged by
those who act from the heart. They make the community truly Church.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><BR><B>Luke</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 4:21-30</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus attends the synagogue service on the sabbath. He has just
read some verses from Isaiah. He now tells worshippers that he
fulfils them: he is the expected messiah; he will rescue all those
who are in need; God&rsquo;s promises made to Israel are &ldquo;fulfilled&rdquo;
in the new age. All are &ldquo;amazed&rdquo; (v. 22), they <EM>keep
wondering</EM>: at (as a scholar puts it) Jesus&rsquo; <EM>words of
grace</EM>, of God&rsquo;s freely given gift of love. An Old
Testament usage suggests the &ldquo;words&rdquo; are the word of God.
Probably vv. 22ff describe a subsequent visit to the synagogue. In v.
23, as often in Luke, Jesus takes the offensive: people want him to
perform miraculous deeds to satisfy their curiosity, and for their
benefit. In vv. 25-27, Jesus reminds them of instances where God has
helped foreigners (both women and men) rather than Israelites. (In 1
Kings 17-18, a &ldquo;famine&rdquo;, attributed to God cutting off
Israel, lasts 3 years; in contemporary books about the end times, the
period of persecution and disgrace lasts 3&frac12; years.) The people
are &ldquo;filled with rage&rdquo; (v. 28) because they begin to
realize that Jesus is for others as well as for them. Nazareth, being
on a hillside, has steep slopes down which a person might fall to his
death. Jesus escapes the <EM>lynch mob</EM>: they let him go because
they think he might just be the messiah. He continues his mission in
accord with God&rsquo;s plan.</P>

<H4>Expectations</H4>
<P><I>What do people expect from religion and the Church? What
happens when their expectations are unfulfilled? Explain.</I></P>
<P>Religion has many functions for our society. Some equate religious
life with private life. For these people, faith has a psychological
dimension, a spiritual balm that soothes the stress and strains of
daily life. Or, Church acts as a private club, a Sunday meeting place
for friends.</P>
<P>Others see religion as a moral barometer, a social conscience.
Religious leaders should point the way to a better life, a higher
example. Religious people should help the needy and the oppressed. In
this way, they can help to build a better society.</P>
<P>These, and many other reasons, are good, solid reasons that argue
for religious life and the existence of the Church. But they don't
get to the root reason for religion and religious groups. The
ultimate reason for religion is faith, a relationship with God. The
Church is to foster that faith.</P>
<P>Jesus came to Nazareth for that purpose. But the expectations of
the people lie elsewhere.</P>
<P><B>Popular Translation</B></P>
<P><B>Jesus read from Isaiah the prophet.</B></P>
<P><B>21 Then, he taught the people there, &quot;<FONT COLOR="#f00000">Today,
this Scripture reading came true as you heard it!&quot;</FONT></B></P>
<P><B>22 At first, everyone was happy with Jesus. They were really
amazed at what he said! So, they began to say, &quot;Isn't this just
Joseph's son?&quot;</B></P>
<P><B>23 So Jesus spoke up, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;You really
want to tell me, 'Doctor, heal now! We heard what happened in
Capernaum. Do the same things here!' 24 Listen! No preacher is
accepted in his hometown. 25 Listen again! In the time of Elijah,
there were many widows in Israel when it stopped raining for three
and one half years. And there was a great famine everywhere. God
didn't sent Elijah to any of them except to the widow Serepta from
foreign town of Sidon. In the time of Elisha the prophet, there were
many lepers in Israel. None of them were cured except Nanaam, the
foreigner from Syria.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
<P><B>28 When they heard his words, everyone in the synagogue got
really angry. 29 They stood up and threw Jesus outside Nazareth.
Then, they led him up to the edge of hill on which the city was
built. They were going to throw down to the bottom of the hill. 30
But, Jesus walked away right through them.</B></P>
<P>Jesus proclaimed the fulfillment of Isaiah. But the people from
his own hometown did not accept his message. Jesus and the people had
a parting of the ways. They had different expectations. Ministry vs.
Family.</P>
<P>After Jesus read from the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, he taught
the people in the synagogue.</P>
<P><B>Literal Translation</B></P>
<P><B>21 HE began to speak to them, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Today,
this scripture has been fulfilled while you heard it.&quot;</FONT></B>
<B>22 All approved of HIM, were amazed at the gracious words coming
from HIS mouth, and said, &quot;Is this not Joseph's son?&quot; 23 HE
said to them, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;No doubt you will tell me
this proverb: 'Physician, heal yourself. As much as we heard happen
in Capernaum, also do here in your home region.'&quot; 24 He said to
them, &quot;Amen, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his home
region. 25 In truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in
the days of Elijah when the heavens were closed for three years and
six months, as there was a great famine over all the earth. 26 Elijah
was sent to none of them, except Serepta of the Sidon (area), to a
widow woman. 27 There were many lepers in Israel (in the time of)
Elisha the prophet. None of them were cleansed except Namaan the
Syrian.&quot;</FONT> 28 Hearing these (words), all in the synagogue
were filled with rage. 29 Having stood up, they threw him out of the
city and led him to the top of the hill on which their city had been
built, so they could throw him off. 30 But he, going through their
midst, walked (away).</B></P>
<P>4:22 &quot;All approved of him&quot; is literally &quot;All bore
witness (about) him.&quot; This phrase can also be translated &quot;all
spoke well of him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;were amazed at the gracious words coming from his mouth&quot;
&quot;gracious words&quot; is literally &quot;words of grace.&quot;
The words revealed the inner character of Jesus. We, however, should
not take the &quot;words of grace&quot; to imply Jesus revealed his
divinity at this point in time. The people were amazed at Jesus and,
so, stated surprise because of his humble origins.</P>
<P>&quot;Is this not Joseph's son?&quot; This question can imply
amazement or contempt on the part of Jesus' audience.</P>
<P>4:23 &quot;'Physician, heal yourself. As much as we heard happen
in Capernaum, also do here in your home region.'&quot; Jesus filled
in the thoughts of his audience for Luke's readers. While the proverb
seemed to indicate the physician should be the object of the sentence
(Jesus should heal himself of his &quot;arrogance&quot;), actually
the crowd wanted Jesus to perform miracles to justify his reputation.
In other words, the physician is the subject and the object (the
&quot;sick&quot;) is understood. A better way to translate the
sentence might be &quot;Physician, heal!&quot;</P>
<P>4:22-23 These two verses present us with a problem. Did the people
of Nazareth reject Jesus? Or did Jesus reject the Nazarenes? At
first, the people were amazed and asked a simple question with deep
implications. If Jesus were just the son of Joseph, he, too, should
be a carpenter. In a culture that distrusted change and treasured
stability, a son should follow in his father's footsteps. But, Jesus
did not follow Joseph's lead. Indeed, Jesus raised himself in social
stature as a traveling rabbi-healer. He claimed to be better than his
legal father. So, the question of origin acted as a hinge point. To
see beyond Jesus' humble beginnings required faith.</P>
<P>4:25 &quot;the heavens were closed for three years and six months&quot;
Ancient Jews believed the sky was a large blue bowl that covered a
flat earth. This sky &quot;bowl&quot; held back the waters of
creation. When doors opened in the sky, it would rain. The phrase
&quot;the heavens were closed&quot; meant there was a drought for
three and one half years.</P>
<P>4:29 &quot;the top of the hill on which their city had been built&quot;
Ancient Nazareth was built on the slope of a hill.</P>
<P>4:30 &quot;But he, going through their midst, walked (away).&quot;
Jesus did not escape, but freed himself from their grip and walked
away right through their gathering. No one dared to touch him.</P>
<P>This Sunday's gospel passage is a continuation of last week's
reading when Jesus entered the synagogue and declared Isaiah's
prophecy fulfilled. In that declaration, Jesus referred to himself as
God's servant, the Chosen One upon whom God had given his Spirit.
Jesus' mission was proof of that claim; he preached, taught, and
healed in the name of God's Kingdom. [21] His simple, straightforward
declaration would cause controversy to those who thought they knew
&quot;Joseph's son.&quot; [22]</P>
<P>At first, Jesus acknowledged their objections:</P>
<P>&quot;Physician, cure yourself.&quot; Some in the small town
community who watched Jesus grow up had placed Jesus into a box, a
pecking order, like many family members do. They knew his strengths
and weaknesses, so they thought Jesus should prove himself at that
moment. And prove them wrong! This was simply their way of putting
Jesus into his place.</P>
<P>&quot;Do here in your native place the things that we heard were
done in Capernaum.&quot; Others in the community were looking for a
show. Unconsciously, they had reduced Jesus' ministry to an
intellectual debate over theology and a few parlor tricks (i.e.,
healings and exorcisms). For them, Jesus had entertainment value.</P>
<P>Jesus responds to their comments with an appeal to the two great
prophets of Galilee: Elijah and Elisha. The two signs given by these
prophets were to foreigners to promote faith in the Jewish God. As
these great prophets were called to do, so was Jesus. [25-27]</P>
<P>Why did the crowd rise up against Jesus? Because he stepped
outside the box they had constructed for Jesus. He was no longer the
local boy who made good; he was a self-proclaimed prophet. And his
signs were not for the edification of the mob, but for the glory of
God. In these ways, he rejected the expectations of those in
Nazareth, and, so, they rejected him. [24, 28-29] As a last sign to
them, Jesus walked safely through them and, according to Scripture,
he never returned to his hometown. [30]</P>
<P>Catechism Themes: Praying at Difficult Times (CCC 2752-2758)</P>
<P>Expectations can be caused by frustration. We want something to
happen. So we look to others for fulfillment. Faith can become
confused. And prayer can dry up.</P>
<P>Why does prayer sometimes seem so hard? Prayer is sometimes
difficult because we fight against ourselves and the temptations
around us (including the devil). Prayer can become hard when we use
prayer for selfish ends (praying only for a particular need or to
reduce stress), or when we don't take the time to pray on a regular
basis, or when we reject prayer as a &quot;waste of time.&quot;
Prayer can be extremely hard when we sense personal failure; we have
the temptation to give up instead of persevering. As a result, we can
feel dry and can be easily distracted in prayer; we can even lose
faith and become depressed. (2752, 2753, 2754, 2755)</P>
<P>What can we do when prayer becomes hard? We can take two
strategies when prayer becomes hard. First, we can realize that our
faith is being tested; we can change our prayer in order to seek
God's will for us. Second, we can realize that prayer is never
wasted; we are challenged to use prayer as a means to overcome
frustration in prayer. As St. Paul said, &quot;Pray constantly.&quot;
(1 Thess. 5:17) (2756, 2757)</P>
<P>How did Jesus pray in his time of difficulty? In John 17, Jesus
prayed a prayer for his disciples called the &quot;priestly prayer.&quot;
Even before his death, he prayed for the unity of his followers and
for union with his followers. His prayer teaches us the true measure
of prayer, the desire to be one with God at every point in life.
(2758)</P>
<P><I>What do you expect from prayer? How have your expectations been
fulfilled? How has your prayer life helped (or hindered) your faith
life?</I></P>
<P>Expectations are always hard to fulfill. But, faith is not based
upon expectations, but on a relationship with God. We must recognize
the difference between the two. And place our expectations before
God. (Not the other way around!)</P>
<P><I>Make a list of expectations you have of others, especially of
the Church and its leaders? Take a moment and place those
expectations before God. Do this for the next week. Then review your
list. How have your expectations changed?</I></P>
