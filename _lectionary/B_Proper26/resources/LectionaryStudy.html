<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to
the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for late Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Grace
be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Behold,
he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
of him. Even so, Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>I am
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which
is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Wisdom</B> </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Wisdom has been a book of the
church since the earliest times. For some Christians, it is part of
the Apocrypha (&quot;hidden books&quot;); for others, it is in the
Old Testament. Until this book was written (about 50 BC), the best
that could be hoped for when one died was to exist in some
inderterminate state. Wisdom tells us that being made in the image of
God includes sharing with him in immortality. Only the godly, the
ethical, will be granted eternal life; those who choose to deviate
from God's ways will be punished and will disappear into nothingness.

<P><A HREF="http://divinity.lib.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/BPentecost/bAllSaints.htm#wisdom"><I><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Wisdom
of Solomon 3:1-9</FONT></I></A> 
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>In the Hebrew Bible, life
simply ended with death (or at best, the dead merely existed in an
indeterminate state, separated from God), but during the first
century BC, some Jewish thinkers developed the notion of after-life.
Wisdom is in the Apocrypha or in the Old Testament: the Church has
used it since the earliest times, but the Jewish authorities rejected
it. It is quoted in the New Testament. The thinking is that, at the
Last Judgement, the just (or righteous) will join God and the angels
in heaven, but the unjust (or wicked) will be punished. 2:23-24 says:
&ldquo;... God created us for incorruption, and made us in the image
of his own eternity, but through the devil&rsquo;s envy death entered
the world, and those who belong to his company experience it&rdquo;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">But the &ldquo;righteous&rdquo;
(v. 1) are protected by God, and after death, they will not suffer.
To the wicked (&ldquo;foolish&rdquo;, v. 2), they seem to have simply
ceased to exist, to have been annihilated, but they are actually &ldquo;at
peace&rdquo; (v. 3), with God and the angelic court. It may appear
that they have been punished, but their certain hope in life and in
death is to live for ever. Then v. 5: the hardship they have suffered
in life is really </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">discipline</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">,
a process of testing by God and being found acceptable to him, and a
preparation for receiving &ldquo;great good&rdquo; from him. God&rsquo;s
testing (v. 6) is like refining gold: when the ore is heated, the
metal coalesces and the slag separates: a process of purification.
Isaiah 53, a</FONT></FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#993366"> <FONT SIZE=2>Servant
Song</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#993366"> <FONT SIZE=2>(which we
believe tells of Christ) speaks of a &ldquo;lamb that is led to the
slaughter ... there was no deceit in his mouth&rdquo; and his life is
&ldquo;an offering for sin&rdquo;. This is the sense in which those
who have died are a &ldquo;sacrificial burnt offering&rdquo; (v. 6).
At the Last Judgement (&ldquo;In the time of their visitation&rdquo;,
v. 7) those who have died will triumph (shining and &ldquo;sparks&rdquo;
are images of triumph.) V. 8a summarizes Daniel 7:18-27; in the
context of Wisdom, it simply means that the just will rule over the
wicked (although many Jews took Daniel as saying that, in the
Messianic age, Israel, the just, would rule all other nations.) In
the age to come, &ldquo;the faithful&rdquo; (v. 9), &ldquo;those who
trust&rdquo; in God, will understand ultimate &ldquo;truth&rdquo;,
i.e. God, and will dwell in a loving relationship with him, because
of his freely-given gift of love (&ldquo;grace&rdquo;) to, and
forgiveness of (&ldquo;mercy&rdquo;) those he chooses.</FONT></FONT></P>

</I></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This book can be divided into
two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before
the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult
times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in
723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as
social injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought
valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile
in Babylon. They are filled with a message of trust and confident
hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that
Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, written after the
return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and
despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other
gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that
God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new
home for all peoples. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">In accounts of the Last Supper,
Jesus says that he will not drink wine again &ldquo;until that day
when I drink it new in the kingdom of God&rdquo; (see Mark 14:25).
Earthly language is inadequate for expressing heavenly notions.
Chapters 24 to 27 of Isaiah are a prophecy about the </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">end-times</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">;
our reading is a description of the celestial banquet to which Jesus
refers. (Other ancient Near East cultures also use a banquet as a
description of the final happiness of the godly.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Chapter 24 begins with the
announcement of the destruction of the earth. There will be total
upheaval of the social order (24:2). God will then destroy the earth.
Most people will have broken the covenant with him, so he will cause
them to &ldquo;suffer for their guilt&rdquo; (24:6) and die. Only a
godly remnant will remain. The earth will be a gloomy place (24:7-13)
but then the survivors will praise God&rsquo;s name (24:14-16a). &ldquo;On
that day&rdquo; (24:21) God will imprison rebellious angels and the
kings of the earth for a long time and then punish them (24:22). &ldquo;...
the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem ...&rdquo;
(24:23). As the seventy elders beheld God&rsquo;s glory at Sinai, so
Israel&rsquo;s elders will again see him enthroned in his majesty.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">Then &ldquo;on this mountain&rdquo;
(25:6), at Jerusalem, God will provide a banquet &ldquo;for all
peoples&rdquo;, for the godly of all nations, with food and the wine
of which Jesus speaks. The dead are pictured as being covered with a
&ldquo;shroud&rdquo; (25:7) or &ldquo;sheet&rdquo;; this will be
removed when God </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">swallows
up</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">, does away
with, &ldquo;death forever&rdquo;. God&rsquo;s kingdom will be
established. In eternal life, he will &ldquo;wipe away&rdquo; (25:8)
one of the roots of all misery, our mortality, and he will remove the
collective shame of breaking the covenant. The remnant, the godly,
will acknowledge &ldquo;our God&rdquo; (25:9), for whom we have
waited and who has saved us; let us &ldquo;rejoice in his salvation&rdquo;.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of
collections. The psalms were written over many centuries, stretching
from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile
(about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments,
thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed
be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT></FONT>

24</FONT></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This psalm is based on a
Canaanite myth which tells of the divine conquest of the unruly
forces of chaos. The psalmist has transformed it into a hymn of
praise to God, the victorious creator, followed by a liturgy on
entering the Temple. In question-and-answer form, it was probably
sung antiphonally, as the Ark was borne to the Temple. Vv. 1-2
acknowledge God as creator. V. 3 asks: who will be admitted to the
Temple? Vv. 4-6 give the answer: those who are pure, do not worship
false gods, and do not harm others with false oaths. They will be
blessed by God, with prosperity. In vv. 7-10, the pilgrims identify
God in terms traditionally associated with the Ark: he is &ldquo;King
of glory&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Lord of hosts&rdquo; (v. 10), the war
hero of Israel (v. 8b). The &ldquo;doors&rdquo; (v. 9) are those
between the outer court and the sanctuary of the Temple. Perhaps a
priest asks: &ldquo;Who is the King of glory?&rdquo; (v. 8) from
within, and the people answer from the court. (The &ldquo;heads&rdquo;,
v. 7, are the lintels of the doors.) God dwells in the sanctuary.</FONT></FONT></P>

</I></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This is the last book of the
Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of the Bible. It is an
apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future and presents an
understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle between good and
evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic
language, its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of
persecution. It is hard to understand because we do not know the
meaning of the symbols (e.g. animals) it uses. </FONT></FONT>

21:1-6a</A></FONT></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This book is &ldquo;the
revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:1) made known through John. It
is prophecy which reveals secrets of heaven and earth. Our reading is
from John&rsquo;s record of his vision of the end-times. He has told
of the destruction of the old city, Babylon (code name for Rome) and
of the old heaven and earth (20:11); the ungodly have been driven off
to punishment (20:15). Only the godly, a remnant, remain. Isaiah
65:17-25 and 66:22 predict that all creation will be renewed, freed
from imperfections and transformed by the glory of God.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Now John sees the new creation.
The &ldquo;sea&rdquo; (21:1), a symbol of turbulence, unrest and
chaos, is no more. He sees &ldquo;the new Jerusalem&rdquo; (21:2),
probably not made with bricks and mortar, &ldquo;holy&rdquo;, of
divine origin, beautiful and lovely as a &ldquo;bride&rdquo;.
(Marriage is a symbol of the intimate union between the exalted
Christ and the godly remnant. Some see the city as the church, set
apart for God&rsquo;s use in the world.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>John hears &ldquo;a loud voice&rdquo;
(21:3) interpreting 21:2: God again comes to &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; (be
present spiritually) with &ldquo;his peoples&rdquo;. Sorrow, death
and pain &ndash; characteristics that made the old earth appear to be
enslaved to sin &ndash; will disappear (21:4). God, &ldquo;seated on
the throne&rdquo;, speaks in vv. 5-6: he will do everything described
in 21:1-4; he is sovereign over all that happens in human history.
(&ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Omega&rdquo; are the first and last
letters of the Greek alphabet, so God encompasses all.) God will give
the gift of eternal life (&ldquo;water&rdquo;, 21:6b) to all who seek
him.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>John is the fourth gospel. Its
author makes no attempt to give a chronological account of the life
of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but rather
&quot;...these things are written so that you may come to believe
that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing
you may have life in his name.&quot; John includes what he calls
signs, stories of miracles, to help in this process. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Lazarus, Mary&rsquo;s brother,
has died. Martha has told Jesus that he would not have died had Jesus
been present, but that the Father will grant whatever Jesus asks.
Jesus has said to her: &ldquo;Your brother will rise again&rdquo; (v.
23), which she takes to refer to the general resurrection Jews
expected at the end of time. Jesus has answered: &ldquo;I am the
resurrection and the life&rdquo; (v. 25); even though a believer dies
physically, he or she will live on as a person. She has added: &ldquo;I
believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into
the world&rdquo; (v. 27).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">Now Mary repeats her earlier
assertion (v. 32). Jesus is stirred with indignation, probably at the
sorrow death brings. He weeps because he is touched by the pain of
those he loves and shares that pain in some real way. Martha tries to
restrain Jesus from viewing the decomposing corpse of his friend (v.
39). Jesus says to her: </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">did

Father and Son, bring Lazarus back to physical life. Jesus verbalizes
his thanks to the Father as he tells the unbelieving &ldquo;crowd&rdquo;

Lazarus emerges, still wrapped in burial cloths.</FONT></FONT></P>
