is the Seventh Sunday of Easter and I am already tired. Maybe if the
Easter season were not so long I could maintain the enthusiasm. I could
continue to shout with unwavering conviction, “He is risen indeed!
Alleluia!” But when I look around my life, what is there really to
shout about? I have dishes piled high in the sink, work is as
challenging as ever with its above average demands and below average
access to resources, and my husband and I just received a dental bill
the size of a small retirement fund. Life is the same routine
monotonous boredom it has always been. <br>
<br>
I sometimes think that the season of Easter can be even more depressing
than the season of Lent. At least when we are still waiting for the
resurrection, we can still have some hope, some anticipation of what is
to come. But what happens when you come out of the other side of the
cross and nothing has changed? Everything remains the same. As the
resurrection fades to a distant memory, the stagnant waters of our
renewed baptism become murkier and murkier. Was this what the world was
waiting for?

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each
generation of Christians has had to struggle with how to live in a
post-resurrection world, beginning with Jesus’ own generation. Jesus’
beloved disciples had the advantage of living in both a
pre-resurrection and a post-resurrection world – before the cross and
after the cross. Moreover, they had instructions from Jesus’ own mouth
of how to continue after he was gone. Having been commissioned to go
out and spread the good news and lay down the foundations for the
community of faith, it was essential to their mission that they
continued to believe that the good news was indeed good news. <br>
<br>
As the disciples soon discovered, the post-resurrection world was not a
world void of violence and suffering. In Acts 16:16-34, Paul and Silas
are arrested at Philippi for doing the work of God and casting out evil
spirits. They are tortured and chastised and thrown into prison
(22-24). Despite their suffering, they continue to pray and sing hymns
to God (25), tremendous acts of faith in the midst of such dire
circumstances. We quickly learn that though the resurrection has not
yet eradicated the world of such evil forces, they are not enough to
thwart the will and the work of God. For through divine intervention,
an earthquake shatters the prison walls and breaks Paul and Silas free
from their bonds (26). And on top of that, it is through this
unfortunate ordeal that another unbeliever comes to faith (33)! Though
God may not have desired the suffering of the disciples to take place
in the first place, God is able to turn it around and make something
positive come out of it. </font></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Link to the Second Reading</b></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This
is good news indeed, but is this all there is? Did Christ come and
suffer and die and be raised again so that we could all come and suffer
and die and be raised to? From the earliest strands of our Jewish
history, long before Jesus of Nazareth had taken flesh, our Messianic
expectations have hoped for something more, a new age, a new Jerusalem
where suffering and dying no longer exist. The book of Revelation is
the place in the New Testament where such hopes are most strongly
flushed out. <br>
<br>
Revelation has not only been one of the most controversial books of the
New Testament in the history of Christian scholarship but it has also
been one of the most abused books. Many have treated the book as a
coded analysis for unlocking current events and even predicting the
date of the end of the world. Such attempts, while they may be grounded
in genuine seeking, are unfaithful to the genre itself. Apocalyptic
writings are by nature rich in mystery and vivid symbology that relates
present events to the hope of a future reality. Thus it is not as
likely that the author of revelation would have been prophesying about
future events such as the Holocaust or 9/11 as he or she would have
been more apt to relate to historical atrocities from its own time
period such as the very real threat of persecution under the Roman
Emperors Nero and Domitian. <br>
<br>
Whatever our relationship with this mysterious book has been in the
past, we should not allow our fear and confusion to prevent us from
approaching the book and gaining its wonderful theological insights.
For aside from its intimidating imagery and impending prophecies of
doom, when read in its entirety the book of revelation contains some of
the earliest most powerful Christian liturgy as well as an inspiring
vision for the redemption of all of creation. Jesus is coming again,
and no matter how literal, how gradual, how cosmic you understand that
to be, what you are left with is a world where the bridge between
heaven and earth has been gapped and a moving invitation for everyone
to be a part of it:<br>
<br>
“The Spirit and the bride say, “come.”<br>
And let everyone who hears say, “come.”<br>
And let everyone who is thirsty come.  (Rev 22:17)<br>
<br>
In the Epilogue of this last book of the Bible, we are reminded that
Jesus is coming soon (12, 20). And in faith we realize that our deepest
liturgical response to the Call to Worship “He is risen,” is not simply
“He is risen indeed,” but “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!”
</font></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Link to the Gospel</b></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As
Christians in this generation we still live between the tension of “He
is risen indeed!” and “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!” It is a difficult place
to live, between the already and the not yet, and it can only be lived
in faith. But the good news is that it is not a place that we dwell
alone. For we are always in the company of other people of faith as
well. <br>
<br>
In the night before Jesus’ betrayal, Jesus offers up a prayer (John
17:20-26). His prayer is that we may be one, just as Jesus is one with
the Father (21). Jesus’ prayer gives us an image of Christian community
based on the unity of the Father and the Son. Just as God dwells in
Jesus, Jesus is present in the community of faith. And in making God’s
love known to us, we are able to love one another and be one in Christ
(26). <br>
<br>
We may not know the exact way and the exact time and the exact place in
which God’s salvific history will work itself out, but in Christian
community we are not alone. Not only are we able to love one another
but in that love Christ is present. The lines between the already and
the not yet become blurred and the liturgy becomes reality. The Easter
promise has not faded. Christ is coming soon, and yet, if you look
around he is already here, present in the community of faith.

Christians have had a difficult time with the book of Revelation, not
really knowing what to do with it. Even Martin Luther himself treated
it as secondary Scripture and practically dispensable. What has your
relationship been like with the book of revelation? Jot down as many
interpretations as you can think of that you have heard other people
say about Revelation. Take some time to sit down and read the book in
one sitting? What themes and images do you notice? What in the book do
you react negatively to? What do you react positively to? When read as
a whole do you think it is appropriate to isolate certain passages and
try and interpret them apart from the rest of the book in correlation
with current events unfolding in history?</font></font></li>
