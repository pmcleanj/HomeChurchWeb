time, the first and second books of Samuel formed a single book. They
were separated in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures
known as the Septuagint (about 250 BC). 1 Samuel begins with the
story of Samuel: hence the name. 1 Samuel is the first of four books
which tell the story of Israel's monarchy. Samuel anointed the first
king. We then read about King Saul, and later about David's rise to
prominence. </FONT></FONT>

has two wives, Peninnah and Hannah. Peninnah has borne him children,
but for many years Hannah has been childless. Even so, Elkanah has
loved her. After years of Peninnah&rsquo;s taunting, Hannah could
take it no longer. During an annual pilgrimage to the temple at
Shiloh, she has sought out Eli the priest; before him she has vowed
that if God granted her a son, she would dedicate him to the Lord.
Further, he would refrain from drink and not allow his head to be
shaved throughout his life. Eli has interceded with God on her behalf
and she has trusted in God to grant her wish. After returning home, a
son has been born to her and Elkanah. When Samuel is old enough
(probably aged three or four), she has taken him to Eli, to serve in
the Temple.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Now we
read of Samuel&rsquo;s childhood. A &ldquo;linen ephod&rdquo; was an
apron, a light ceremonial garment worn by a priest &ndash; so Samuel
is now a priest. The couple continue to visit the temple annually
(&ldquo;yearly sacrifice&rdquo;, v. 19), perhaps on the Day of
Atonement. Hannah&rsquo;s &ldquo;gift ... to the LORD&rdquo; (v. 20)
is her son. As repayment for Samuel&rsquo;s faithful service, &ldquo;the
LORD took note of Hannah&rdquo; (v. 21) by giving her five more
children. Samuel grows up not in a home and family but &ldquo;in the
presence of the LORD&rdquo;, in the temple. Samuel&rsquo;s fidelity
is contrasted with the evil ways of Eli&rsquo;s sons, who even lie
with women who have sacred duties (v. 22). The sons&rsquo; misdeeds
are known in the community (v. 24). They sin against God by their
disregard for Eli, by their irreverence, and their greed and
arrogance concerning sacrificial meat &ndash; so God has to punish
them (v. 25). On the other hand, Samuel grows in spirituality and
popularity in the community (v. 26). Eli&rsquo;s sons die when the
Philistines defeat Israel in battle (4:11).</FONT></FONT></P>

hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and

was a city in what is now southwestern Turkey. It had a flourishing
wool and textile industry and a significant Jewish population. It
seems that most Christians there were Gentile. Although long thought
to be written by Paul, today this epistle is considered non-Pauline
for a number of reasons. The most compelling is that it emphasizes
what God has already done for his people: Paul tells us what God is
going to do in the future (although some argue that Paul shifted his
viewpoint in later life.) It gives descriptions of false teachings
which were being promulgated in the churches. Some scholars consider
this evidence of later authorship. In the ancient world, writing in

God (v. 5-6). The author has told them: &ldquo;you have stripped off

gentleness and consideration towards others. Christ&rsquo;s

</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Luke is
the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New
Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who
accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three
sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings (known as Q for
</FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Quelle</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">)
and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the
poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers.
Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he
wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">This is
the only passage in the Bible that tells of Jesus&rsquo; boyhood. On
the &ldquo;festival of the Passover&rdquo;, Jews celebrated both
Israel&rsquo;s deliverance from Egypt and the Festival of Unleavened
Bread, a symbol of the start of a new year. Jesus&rsquo; family is
pious. He is now &ldquo;twelve years old&rdquo; (v. 42); in another
year, he will officially become a man (now celebrated by Jews in the

mitzvah</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">).
After the eight days of the festival, the &ldquo;group&rdquo; (v. 44,
probably the whole village) begins the journey back to Nazareth.
Joseph and Mary find Jesus in the outer court of the Temple &ldquo;among
the teachers&rdquo; (v. 46), experts in Jewish law. Respectful of the
law, he not only listens and asks questions, but also answers their
questions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">V. 49
marks a turning point in the gospel: these are the first words of
Jesus we have; for the first time Jesus&rsquo; father is named as the
Father &ndash; until now, Joseph has been called his father. Note
&ldquo;must&rdquo;: the relationship between Jesus and the Father
requires obedience. Parents do reach the point where they do not
understand their children (v. 50); here Mary and Joseph do not
comprehend that his relationship with God takes precedence over being
their child. Upon return to Nazareth, he obeys his parents in
everyday life. In spite of not understanding, Mary &ldquo;treasured&rdquo;
(v. 51) what Jesus says &ndash; as his mother and also as the model
believer. Jesus continues to grow physically and in understanding,
preparing himself for the mission that lies ahead of him (v. 52).</FONT></FONT></P>

words ring out at this time each year. Words that cause us to take
stock of the past. Words that inspire us to look for hope in the
future. Words of reflection and anticipation. Words of conservation
and of change. Words of the old and the new.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Like
last week, Luke presented the tension between the old and the new.
Last week, Elizabeth, representing the old, honored the new in Mary.
This week, Jesus himself proclaimed his place in God's new order, as
he honored the old traditions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">As
Luke presented a maturing Jesus, he began to paint the tension
between the old (Jewish traditions) and the new (the way of the
Nazarene). While Jesus stood firmly within the traditions of Judaism,
his words revealed something far greater. God had indeed begun to act
in the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Again,
Luke used an account in the infancy narrative to bridge from the old
to the new, from the people's daily traditions to the realization of
God's Son. In the set up of the account, Luke stressed continuity
with Jewish tradition within a family. Joseph and Mary traveled with
their clan to Jerusalem for Passover. The capital had the one place
where the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob definitely dwelt: the
Temple. The importance of the city and its Temple gave a focal point
to Jewish spirituality. Both realized the fulfillment of God's
promise to Father Abraham for a nation and its land. The family
tradition of pilgrimage reinforced the Jewish spiritual focus. Joseph
and Mary walked, like their Exodus ancestors, to a place that
symbolized Judaism's history and aspirations. The pilgrimage had
spiritual overtones, but so did its end point.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Luke
mixed images of Jesus in the narrative. At first, Luke introduced
Jesus as a young man, a &quot;son of the Law&quot; who had all the
rights and the obligations of an adult male. As such, Jesus
accompanied Joseph and Mary to the festival in Jerusalem. Yet, when
Jesus stayed behind, Luke referred to him as a &quot;young boy,&quot;
a term that had overtones of enslavement. Whom was he enslaved to?
The answer would come later in the narrative.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The
search for Jesus heightened the tension between the image of the &quot;son
of the Law&quot; and the enslaved minor. The Holy Couple sought for
Jesus among his clan, where everyone thought his place should be.
(Remember that members of his own clan and his townsfolk would later
reject Jesus in Luke 4:14-30) The old would define his place within
his family. But the new would define the place of Jesus within a new
family, with a new Father.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Joseph
and Mary returned to the place where, according to tradition, the
Messiah would be revealed in his glory. This was the second of two
narrative accounts in which Luke used the place and the people to
emphasize that point. In Luke 2:22-38, the parents presented the
child at the Temple. And two prophets proclaimed the Good News that
the Messiah had been born.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">In this
second account, Jesus himself revealed his Messiahship with an
enigmatic answer. &quot;Did you not know that it was necessary (for)
me to be in the (things) of my Father?&quot; As the note mentioned
above, the phrase can refer to place (the Temple) or to affairs (his
teaching ministry). In either case, Jesus acted in the role God had
given him. While Jesus might have been an enfranchised Jewish male,
he, as the only Son of God, was enslaved to the will of his Father.
Jesus did not really belong to the clan from Nazareth. He belonged to
his true Father. Jesus' place was in the Father's house (i.e.,
building and family). Jesus' mission was to teach the people the way
back to the Father. He amazed the teachers just as he would amaze the
people along his mission road. But Joseph and Mary did not understand
his reasoning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The
tension between the parents and the child began to fulfill the
prophecy Simeon made to Mary and foreshadowed Jesus' death and
resurrection. The search caused Mary pain and anxiety (one of the
swords that pierced her heart). The climax of the story occurred
three days after the celebration of Passover (a foreshadowing of the
Resurrection).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Despite
the confrontation, Jesus grew in honor (wisdom, size, and
reputation). Jesus was a faithful Jew as he honored his parents and
obeyed the Fourth Commandment. He existed within the old, the Jewish
tradition. But all signs pointed to the new. He was the Messiah. And
he would reveal God acting in a new way, with a new people.</FONT></FONT></P>

Theme: The Mysteries of Jesus' Hidden Life (CCC 531-534)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The
hallmark of Jesus' life before his baptism was silence. He lived an
ordinary life, doing what ordinary people did at the time. He was a
Jew, obedient to his faith, his family, and his profession. In that
way, Jesus lived as we live. The silence of his early years stressed
his solidarity with our human condition. But that silence also sowed
the seeds of his ministry, his obedience to the Father.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The
finding of Jesus in the Temple is the only break to that silence. As
we saw above, that narrative looked to that ordinary life, but also
looked forward to an extraordinary ministry.</FONT></FONT></P>

may have jolted the couple, but it pointed to what would be. We, too,
need a time to seek God's will, to take a peek at the future. What we
see may jolt us, too. But, that vision will lead to joy and to hope.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
