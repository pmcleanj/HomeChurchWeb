<h2>Begin Again! </h2>
<p><br> &#8220;Begin again.&#8221;&nbsp; Her name was Mrs. Griebenow and she said
these words often.&nbsp; Mrs. Griebenow was my piano teacher growing up
and she would say these words when she would see me struggling with a
piece of music.&nbsp; Sometimes she would say these words when she
wanted me to get something just right.&nbsp; One time, she said &#8220;begin
again&#8221; because she let me start with my &#8220;dessert&#8221; which consisted of my
favorite pieces before having me go back and start again with my scales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mrs. Griebenow always spoke these words when I would leave her home
after the lesson.&nbsp; &#8220;Now, begin again Eric.&#8221;&nbsp; Maybe she spoke
these words in hopes that I would see the week ahead as a new
beginning.&nbsp; Maybe she hoped I would change my practice
habits.&nbsp; (In my later years of taking lessons my practice habits
were as sporadic as my diets are today).&nbsp; For many years, Mrs.
Griebenow had higher aspirations for me with the piano than I had for
myself.&nbsp; But, I did not like going to piano unprepared.&nbsp;
Sometimes the words &#8220;begin again&#8221; would give me a new lease on my life
as a piano student.&nbsp; Sometimes I would actually begin again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Advent is yet another opportunity for us to begin again.&nbsp; Many
people miss church the Sunday after Thanksgiving thus missing the
beginning of Advent.&nbsp; There is still time to get the Advent wreath
out and encourage family devotions as we begin our march towards
Christmas.&nbsp; There is still time to carve personal time out in the
midst of holiday havoc that our consumer world pushes on us this
season.&nbsp; Begin again.</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Lesson (Isaiah 40:1-11) </h4>
      <p>Comfort,
O comfort my people, says our God.&nbsp; These words are repeated in
the beloved Advent hymn (LBW 29).&nbsp; These words come as a new
beginning dawns for God&#8217;s people.&nbsp; Commentators tend to agree that
at chap. 40 of Isaiah, we move from the threat of Babylonian victory to
the completion of that victory.&nbsp; Judah and Jerusalem in Isaiah&#8217;s
mind have now paid for their sins at the hands of the
Babylonians.&nbsp; It is in the midst of defeat that these stunning
words come to a now exiled people.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The prophet Isaiah now delivers words of hope.&nbsp; &#8220;Every valley
shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground
shall become level, the rugged places a plain.&nbsp; And the glory of
the Lord will be revealed and all people shall see it together, for the
mouth of the Lord has spoken.&#8221;&nbsp; As we begin again we can know that
some things never change or as the old saying goes, &#8220;The more things
change the more they remain the same.&#8221;&nbsp; God again acts mercifully
toward the people of Israel.&nbsp; As we read the stories of Adam and
Eve and the fall, Noah and the flood, Israel in the wilderness, Jonah
and the people of Nineveh etc. etc. we see a God who punishes yes, but
always comes back with mercy and an invitation to begin again.&nbsp;
Through times of exile and loss of the people&#8217;s trust, God begins again
never losing hope that humanity will change its ways.&nbsp; </p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading (2 Peter 3: 8-15) </h4>
      <p>Part
of the Advent theme is also to &#8220;be prepared&#8221; as &#8220;we wait for new
heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.&#8221;&nbsp; As we
continually look to begin again the writer of II Peter exhorts the
followers of Jesus to strive for peace without spot or blemish and
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.&#8221;&nbsp; As always we stand
in the mercy of God.&nbsp; As we pray for Christ to come again we
strive to live as the baptized.&nbsp; Each day we are to be &#8220;born
again&#8221; as we remember our baptism.&nbsp; Through baptism we have been
marked with the Cross of Christ and that mark invites us into a life of
being Christ&#8217;s body in the world.</p>
  <h4>The Gospel Reading (Mark 1: 1-8)</h4>
  <p>I
see this Gospel lesson and the Gospel of Mark as a whole telling the
story of God beginning again with creation and with us.&nbsp; This
shortest of Gospels is my favorite because in it God&#8217;s Son is sent to
change the way that God will deal with this world forever.&nbsp; The
story we get in Mark&#8217;s Gospel is not to be the whole story of Jesus the
Christ.&nbsp; The first line tells us this, &#8220;The beginning of the Good
News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&#8221;&nbsp; Here we have the story of
Jesus life, death, and resurrection.&nbsp; The whole story of Jesus
continues with our story as the body of Christ in the world.&nbsp; We
come to church not only to hear about the past works of Jesus, but to
think about how life could or should unfold in our own lives because of
Jesus.</p>
  <p>During this season of advent, our Bible stories bear
the promise to us that our own exile, however that may take form, shall
not be the last word in our lives.&nbsp; We know exile don&#8217;t we.&nbsp;
Some of us know exile in the literal sense, having been exiled from our
country of origin.&nbsp; But all of us know what it is to feel detached
and separated from that which is important to us.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>We
know what it is to feel separated from loved ones and even from
ourselves.&nbsp; Some of us know what it is to feel separated from our
neighbors and the actions of our government.&nbsp; All these things can
bring fear and uncertainty to our lives.&nbsp; To this world Jesus
comes with the invitation, begin again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; Where in your
life is Christ inviting you to begin again?&nbsp; Have you been away
from church for a while?&nbsp; This is the place you are fed and
nourished with word and sacrament, the invitation comes, begin
again!&nbsp; Have you started down the path of holiday havoc stuck in
stressful schedules with too much to do after promising yourself that
this year you would keep focused on keeping things simple?&nbsp; The
invitation comes, &#8220;begin again!&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In verse
8 of today&#8217;s Gospel, John the Baptist says of Jesus, &#8220;He will baptize
you with the Holy Spirit&#8230;.&#8221;&nbsp; Jesus continues to help us begin
again when it looks like we have no place to turn.&nbsp; The Holy
Spirit doesn&#8217;t go with Jesus to dwell back up in the heavens; she
continually comes with Jesus renewing in us the gifts of forgiveness,
love, and new life. Because of Jesus, we will never again be left to
ourselves.</p>
  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;Where in your life is Christ inviting you to  begin again?</p>
