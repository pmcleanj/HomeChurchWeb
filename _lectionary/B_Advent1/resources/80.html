									<p class="versetxt"><b>Psalm 80</b></p>
									<h4>Come, Lord, Restore Us</h4>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>How have you prayed in times of desperation? What were the results of those prayers?</i></p>
									<p class="bodytext">There&#8217;s
a story about an airplane that spinning out of control. As the
passengers realize they are about to die, some curse while some pray.
While I admit this story probably began as a flight of fancy, it does
clearly define how people react in times of desperation. Some look
inward only to find despair. Others reach out to God.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Psalm
80 was a prayer of desperation, but not despair. The tone of the psalm
revealed a weak Judea ravaged by its neighbors. This was the situation
during the reign of Josiah (640-609 BC). The Assyrians had swept away
the northern kingdom of Israel. The southern kingdom of Judea had been
whittled away to the city-state of Jerusalem. The priest-cantor cried
out to YHWH so he would restore the former glory of the kingdom.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">In
80:1-3, the cantor implored the Shepherd of Israel to reveal himself to
the areas of the northern kingdom of Israel and some of the lost
regions of Judea (the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh).
Notice revelation, power, and salvation were synonymous; as YHWH
revealed himself, he would show his power (in the might of the armies
of Judea?) and save his people. After these petition, the cantor sang
the refrain (80:4) that would be repeated in 80:8 and 80:20; Lord,
restore your people and let your face shine upon us (i.e., give us your
blessings).</p>
									<p class="bodytext">80:5-7 stated the
condition of the people; they cried tears of lamentation that were so
common, they acted as daily food. They lamented, &#8220;Why us, O Lord?&#8221; The
nation was weak, its reputation was ridiculed. &#8220;Why us, O Lord?&#8217;</p>
									<p class="bodytext">In
80:9-12, the analogy of the vineyard described the activity of God and
the glory of Israel. God brought the people out of Egypt and planted
them in Canaan. The nation grew in power and prestige; it reached its
height under Solomon (the growth of the vine described the extent of
Solomon&#8217;s empire). But, 80:13-14 described the downfall of the nation
whose enemies attacked and ravaged the land (walls broken down and the
wild boar eating the fruit).</p>
									<p class="bodytext">The psalm
ended with a prayer for restoration. 80:15-19 returned to the theme of
revelation and power. O Lord, return and fight against our enemies.
Part of that restoration was a strong monarchy (80:18, the king who sat
at the Lord&#8217;s right hand). In response to the restoration, the cantor
promises the fidelity of the people.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Psalm
80 was a prayer that grew out of desperate times, but not times of
despair. It is not an inward reflection on hopelessness, but a cry to
the Lord for help. The psalm looked forward to better days, when the
Lord would restore his people.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">We,
too, look forward to times of happiness. We look forward to the return
of the Lord in glory, at the end of time and at the celebration of
Christmas.</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>How can times like Advent restore your spirit</i>?</p>
