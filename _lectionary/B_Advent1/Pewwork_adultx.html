<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>For
most Christians the First Sunday of Advent is a sign of hope. We
begin a new cycle in the church year. We look forward to celebrating
Christmas and getting into the &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; spirit. And we
think about the coming of Christ and what that event has meant in our
lives and our history.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Scripture readings for the First Sunday of Advent, however, say
nothing about the first coming of Christ and Christmas. Rather, they
lead us to focus on the second coming of Christ and the fullness of
God&rsquo;s kingdom. They provide not only a bridge from one
liturgical year to another but also place before us the kingdom of
God as the goal and horizon of all Christian hope.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>When
defining hope, most dictionaries include something like the
following: Hope is the desire for something with the possibility of,
or belief in, its realization. Hope must have an object or goal; we
need to hope for something. Hope must have a basis; otherwise, our
hopes are daydreams or fantasies. And hope involves the belief that
what we hope for can be accomplished. The readings for the First
Sunday of Advent can help to place our Christian hopes in the larger
context of hope for the fullness of God&rsquo;s kingdom.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Old Testament text is from that part of the Book of Isaiah (Third
Isaiah, Chapters 56 to 66) that reflects the dark days in Jerusalem,
around 500 B.C., after the return from exile in Babylon. The bright
hopes of the new creation and the new exodus that make Second Isaiah
(Chapters 40 to 55) the high point of the Hebrew Bible had not turned
out so well. The prophet expresses frustration at the poor state of
the Jewish community in its worship, morale, basic morality and
religious observance. Does this sound familiar? Nevertheless, the
prophet&rsquo;s hope in God is stronger than his frustration, and he
utters the classic statement of biblical hope, &ldquo;Oh, that you
would rend the heavens and come down.&rdquo; Christians believe that
this cry of hope has been fulfilled literally (and beyond the
prophet&rsquo;s dreams) in the person of Jesus.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Gospel passage from Mark 13 comes at the end of Jesus&rsquo;
eschatological discourse. Its context is hope for the full coming of
God&rsquo;s kingdom, what we pray for when we say, &ldquo;Thy kingdom
come!&rdquo; The text begins and ends, and is punctuated in the
middle, with calls to be watchful, always on guard and vigilant. The
reason for this constant watchfulness is that we do not know exactly
when the fullness of God&rsquo;s kingdom will come.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
short parable illustrates watching in hope as the proper way to act
in the face of the coming kingdom. Waiting for the kingdom is
compared to the attitude shown by servants in a household as they
await their master&rsquo;s uncertain return. Since they do not know
the precise time of his arrival, they should be expecting him always
and be careful to be found doing their duty always.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
object of Christian hope is the kingdom of God. The basis of that
hope is God&rsquo;s fidelity to God&rsquo;s people through the
centuries. Christians believe that the realization of this hope has
been made possible especially through the first coming of Christ. We
believe that God has indeed rent the heavens and come down. And we
hope for even more. The best is yet to come.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second reading is from the thanksgiving section in Paul&rsquo;s First
Letter to the Corinthians. Given the frustration that Paul
experienced regarding the Corinthians because of all the difficulties
they had gotten themselves into, Paul&rsquo;s opening words to them
are remarkably positive and irenic. He reminds them of all the
spiritual gifts they have received from God. It was the Corinthians&rsquo;
pride over these gifts, especially knowledge, that was the source of
most of their problems. Paul not only insists that these spiritual
gifts are from God (and not matters for personal pride or boasting)
but also places them in the context of the full coming of God&rsquo;s
kingdom. He defines Christian life as waiting &ldquo;for the
revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; and prays that God will
keep the Corinthians &ldquo;firm to the end, irreproachable on the
day of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in; font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Advent
is most obviously a time of special preparation to celebrate properly
an event of the past: the birth of Jesus Christ as one of us humans.
But the Scripture readings for the First Sunday of Advent can help us
to place our Advent and Christmas hopes in the context of the
ultimate Christian hope: eternal life with Christ in the kingdom of
God. They remind us that in the present, Christian life is a matter
of watching in hope for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</FONT></P>
