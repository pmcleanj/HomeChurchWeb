<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>ISAIAH 61:1-4, 8-1
God's justice was a constant theme of the great prophets of Israel.
In these classical lines of Hebrew poetry, the unknown prophet of
Israel's exile in Babylon, or from the school of his disciples,
applied this theme to the promised return to their homeland. If the
prophet&rsquo;s disciples were the authors, then it shows
considerable influence of the master. Its also has many links with
the preceding and following poems in ch. 60 and 62. With emphasis on
the reversal of conditions which the exiles had endured for two
generations from 586-539 BCE. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is surprising that the middle segment of the poem has been dropped
from this reading. It referred to the people of other nations serving
Israel as shepherds and farm workers while Israel concentrated on its
priestly role among the nations. This imaginative description of the
future awaiting the returning exiles indicated how great their
redemption would be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Similarly
powerful imagery in the rest of the poem dramatically revealed the
I</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>sraelites&rsquo; new status in history. Vv. 1-4
declares the new mission in which Israel will engage. Not only would
the ruined cities of Judea be rebuilt, but the ancient covenant
between Israel and God would be renewed. The end result would be a
whole new quality of life and purpose for God's people. They would
serve as a herald of good news to oppressed and captive people,
bringing assurance of God&rsquo;s favour and comfort to those who
mourn. They would enable others to sing praises of joy.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">That theirs
would be a missionary task becomes even clearer in the concluding
segment (vv. 8-11). The return from exile and renewal of the ancient
covenant expressed God&rsquo;s justice, righteousness and salvation
which the exiles descendants would make known to other nations. The
imagery of a new wardrobe which Israel would wear, like that of a
bridegroom and bride dressed for their wedding, described how they
would be prepared for their new role. Their new clothes symbolized
the divine gifts of a moral and spiritual nature. As if that is not
enough to make the point, imagery of growth in a garden reiterated
how God would prepare the new Israel &quot;to spring forth before all
the nations&quot; (vs. 11).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The poem was
written in the first person, a characteristic of much of the poetry
of Second Isaiah. Raised in a culture of almost total individualism,
we may not fully understand how the ancient Israelites conceived of
the covenanted people as a corporate personality and of a single
prophet fulfilling a communal function as in this instance. This
prophet in particular made use of this form to convey what lay ahead
for the returning exiles. In his introduction to Isaiah 40-66, the
late James Muilenburg, formerly of Union Theological Seminary, New
York, proposed that in chs. 40-55, the community was still in Babylon
while in chs. 56-66 it had already returned to Jerusalem. The issues
which faced the latter group, such as those lifted up in this poem,
were notably different from those still in exile. (Abingdon Press,
1951. <I>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible</I>, V, 383.)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">According the
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel (4:16-20), Jesus adopted the first verse of this
passage as the basic theme for his ministry. Without question the
apostolic church read it as a messianic prophecy. Some scholars have
gone so far as to identify this poem with the Servant Songs,
especially Isaiah 52:12-53:12. The eschatological significance of the
message comes to the fore in the prophetic mission expressed in vs.
2: &quot;to proclaim the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favour.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>Reflections and Questions 
</P>
<P>1. The &quot;year of our Lord's favor&quot; is a reference to the
Jubilee Sabbath Year, cf., Lev. 25:8-18. It is a year in which those
who have been victims of the sacrificial institutions get a reprieve
for a year. In 1999 the Catholic Church lifted up the theme of
Jubilee in the face of all the millennialist stuff -- a worthwhile
strategy. 
</P>
<P>2. This is the passage that Jesus reads in Luke 4. Jesus proclaims
himself as the fulfillment of the Jubilee year, a year for victims --
and almost becomes one on the spot, as he narrowly misses a
spontaneous lynching.

passage was probably written after the people of Israel returned from
Exile. It foretells the total salvation of God&rsquo;s people:
bodily, spiritually, individually and socially. The prophet says that
God has empowered him to act on God&rsquo;s behalf; God has
&ldquo;anointed&rdquo; him, commissioned him to preach and to hear
the Word of faith, to understand God&rsquo;s word, and to be
strengthened in following it. (Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+61%3A1-2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1b-2</A>

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><A NAME="PSALM 126"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>PSALM
126</B> This is another of the fifteen songs in the Hebrew scriptures
bearing the title &quot;A Songs of Ascent&quot; (Pss. 120-134).
Scholars differ as to their date, origin and use. The Hebrew Mishnah
speculated that they were sung by the Levite chorus on the fifteen
steps leading from the court of women to the court of Israel, but
this interpretation, though imaginative, is doubtful. It does seem,
however, that they could have been a special collection used by
pilgrims making their way up to Jerusalem for one or other of the
great festivals. It is also possible that over time the collection
broadened to include some songs not directly related to pilgrimage.
This psalm may be one of those later additions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This psalm
celebrated Israel's deliverance from the Babylonian captivity. The
psalmist recalled this joyous time recounted by his ancestors and
written down in several of the prophetic books (Isa. 55:12-13; Zech.
8:1-23; Hag. 2:1-23; Ezra). Those days were long past and life was
not all that had been anticipated. In fact, Israel&rsquo;s barren
life resembled the Negeb desert. So the psalmist lamented the
nation&rsquo;s disappointment. In a concluding prayer, he asked for
God's help in renewing the nation as the dry watercourses of the
Negev desert were renewed by infrequent rains. Not rain, but tears of
sorrow provided the desperately needed moisture. Yet hope flowed with
the tears that an abundant harvest would restore prosperity. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Memories of
Yahweh&rsquo;s past interventions, especially in the return from
exile, made this more than a forlorn hope. Because of the great
things Yahweh had done in the past (vs. 3), the psalmist could
fervently pray &quot;restore our fortunes, O Lord,&quot; (vs. 4).
This short psalm gave full expression to Israel&rsquo;s belief in a
theocratic history. Scholars have also observed a residue of ancient
fertility myths of death and revivification common to all Middle
Eastern cultures in the sowing in sorrow and reaping in joy found in
vs. 6. The image is of a sower carrying his seed in a sack slung over
his shoulder keening a lament even as he scatters the seed. In the
frequent droughts that ravaged the Holy Land, hope often depended on
the next rainfall. </FONT>

use Mary&rsquo;s Song, known as The Magnificat, as the psalm for this

of the nativity narratives as hymns sung by early Jewish Christian
congregations. While they give voice to a deep piety, the words do
not specifically relate to the characters who utter them. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In his
magisterial work, <I>The Birth of the Messiah, </I>Raymond E. Brown
claimed that their closest parallels are to be found in Jewish hymns
and psalms from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Aprocryphal texts of that period
such as I Maccabees, Judith, II Baruch, IV Ezra, and some of the Dead
Sea Scrolls all contain hymns like these. The martial tone of these
canticles seems more in keeping with the nationalistic theology of
history many such Jewish psalms expressed. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Brown further
claimed that they expressed the joy of a pious Jewish Christian group
identified as the <I>Anawim</I>, or &quot;Poor Ones,&quot; who
revered the temple and shared traditional Jewish views of a Davidic
messianism. In Acts 2:43-47 and 4:32-37 there are references to the
existence of such early communities in Jerusalem. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Mary&rsquo;s
song was almost certainly adapted from the Song of Hannah at the
birth of Samuel (1 Samuel 2:1-10. It contains many passages also to
be found in the traditional Psalms of the Old Testament and
Aprocrypha. It can be argued that the Magnificat is better attributed
to Elizabeth than to Mary, as some manuscripts indicated. Brown
believed that Mary&rsquo;s song responded to that of Elizabeth in
1:42-45. Whereas Elizabeth praised Mary as the mother of the Messiah,

THESSALONIANS 5:16-24</B> There is abundant cause for Christians to
rejoice and to give thanks in all circumstances, Paul wrote in what
may have been his earliest letter. With Silas and Timothy, Paul had
visited Thessalonika during his second missionary journey and his
first </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">evangelistic
foray into Macedonia (Acts 16-18). There they gained a few converts,
probably both Jewish and Greek (Acts 17:4). Their chief opposition
came from some of the Jewish population who forced them to leave
hastily for Beroea, Athens, and then Corinth.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The main purpose
of the letter was to give some instructions concerning the future
advent of the Lord Jesus. Apparently the Thessalonians had not fully
understood what Paul had taught them during his short stay there. How
to live the Christian life while waiting for that anticipated
Parousia also played a prominent part in the letter. What was to
become the typical Pauline phrase, &quot;in Christ,&quot;
characterized much of Paul&rsquo;s teaching. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This reading
commends genuine love among the Christian fellowship and encourages
the application of spiritual gifts to their living with one another
in circumstances which provided anything but a favourable milieu.
Note the number of those spiritual gifts named in this short passage:
respect and esteem for spiritual leaders, peace among themselves,
patience with those who are fainthearted and weak, magnanimity toward
one another, rejoicing in constant prayer and thanksgiving,
abstinence from every form of evil. Again and again in his
correspondence with other Christian communities, Paul would return to
and expand upon these same virtues (Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12-14,
Galatians 5:16-6:10, Colossians 4:2-6). </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Note too the
counsel &quot;Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise the words of
the prophets (or alternatively, do not despise prophecies&quot;
(vs.19-20). This may be a reference to the Jewish scriptures which
were the central feature of every synagogue service. Because there
were as yet no &quot;Christian scriptures,&quot; those were the texts
to which the earliest apostles and their converts turned to learn
about the promised Messiah they believed Jesus of Nazareth to be. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vs. 23 contains
a word which has become the ultimate definition of what it means to
be a Christian: &quot;sanctify.&quot; The technical meaning of the
English word, of Latin derivation, is &quot;to make holy.&quot;
Holiness <I>is</I> the Christian life. It comes about, Paul made
clear, not by our efforts, but by God&rsquo;s grace active in our
lives. Here, it has profound implications of a spiritual and physical
nature. To understand this we need only recall that the word <I>holiness</I>
has the same Anglo-Saxon root as <I>wholeness, healing and health.</I>
Jewish thought so familiar to Paul had no concept of any division
between body and spirit. One of the alternate translations of the
phrase &quot;kept sound&quot; is &quot;complete.&quot; This is
coupled with &quot;blameless,&quot; free of guilt. Sound moral
values, a holy and a healthy life come from being obedient to the
Spirit, Paul said to the Thessalonians and to us. By so living we
shall be ready for the coming of Christ which the early Christians
expected at any moment. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">While Paul did
not articulate in detail any theological concept of the Trinity, he
often wrote of what one might call the trinitarian experience. He did
so unequivocally in this passage. He spoke of God, Jesus Christ and
the Holy Spirit as actively engaged in the daily lives of the
believers (vss. 17, 18, 23). Then in vs. 24, he made the simple
statement: &quot;The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do
this.&quot; He did not identity whether he referred to one or other
of the three persons of the Trinity. It never would have occurred to
him to do so. All were involved in the dynamic spiritual process we
call &quot;sanctification.&quot; It is a One to one experience, yet
it takes place within the faithful community where loving
relationships with God and with each other are paramount.</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The message of the Gospel
	during Advent is not to bring us comfort that the systems we have
	become comfortable in will endure; indeed it is the announcement
	that all human institutions shall ultimately collapse back into
	chaos (this is what is meant by the term &lsquo;wrath&rsquo; in Paul
	&ndash; the dissolution of society into anarchy and mutual
	destruction).&nbsp; Our &lsquo;kosmos&rsquo;, the world of our
	making cannot endure for it has been infected with the virus of the
	gospel and has been in the process of deconstruction for almost
	2,000 years.&nbsp; It is this dissolution that creates the scenario
	in the Thessalonian letters that leads us to call them apocalyptic.&nbsp;
	But, and this is a big BUT, followers of Jesus are not to be fearful
	but to exhibit three characteristics at all times: joy, prayer,
	thanksgiving (5:16-18).&nbsp; These never cease from us even in the
	worst of circumstances.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we know that what
	appears to be the end is not really the end, but the hope for a new
	beginning in God.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>During these times of
	tribulation, God, by the Spirit in Jesus, speaks to the church.&nbsp;
	The church is encouraged not to throw water on the Spirit&rsquo;s
	fire that burns through the community and purifies it, but they are
	also not to blindly accept any and every prophecy that comes their
	way, in particular regarding dates (5:1-2).&nbsp; There has always
	been an apocalyptic expectation in the church.&nbsp; Many Christians
	in the first three centuries thought they lived in the last days;
	some Anabaptists and Luther himself thought they lived in the last
	days.&nbsp; The 19th and 20th centuries have seen all kinds of date
	setting.&nbsp; Over and over the Lord has failed to appear.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>So we too may feel like
	we are an apocalyptic edge in our world today, but it may well be
	the case that the human project has another hundred or thousand or
	ten thousand years to go.&nbsp; It is not for us to say.&nbsp; We
	are simply called to be alert to the fact that it might be or could
	be soon, but is not necessarily so.&nbsp; We are called to live
	joyfully, prayerfully and thankfully in these times.&nbsp; That is
	what will make our witness distinct from those preoccupied with
	questions of theodicy.</FONT></FONT></P>

	<P><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Esowhat" --><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>This
	text calls us to determine our standard of measure; will it mirror
	God&rsquo;s or not?&nbsp; As people scramble to prepare for
	Christmas in trappings of red and green, we preachers are called to
	reset the stage for a very different drama. The temptation in this
	brief epistle text for many folks is to hear an admonition to be
	thankful and joyful with no basis in reality, and to pray- that is,
	to beg God for whatever they currently desire 24/7- an equally
	frustrating endeavor.&nbsp; Clearly the church in Thessalonica knew
	the realities of evil and temptation, so analogies between then and
	now work pretty well with this text, enabling us to address the
	larger reality of Paul&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; This close to Christmas-
	this year we&rsquo;re about half-way through December at this
	reading- folks may well be feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of
	celebrating a highly commercial holiday in a difficult economy, thus
	making the temptation to find Paul&rsquo;s encouragement unrealistic
	even more seductive.&nbsp; Preaching the peace of God in the midst
	of chaos is rooted in the opening passages of Genesis; it may be
	helpful to ground ourselves there to access the eternal time span
	that&rsquo;s involved in living the truth of this text.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>God created order (and
	relationship) without sacrificial violence- humanity took that on.
	Reviewing an encapsulated version of the origin of evil (no small
	task, but Michael&rsquo;s anthropological insights are invaluable
	here) as being separate from God- part of the humanly created order
	of culture instead of divinely authored act of original creation-
	helps get us in touch with the real possibility of joy, prayer, and
	thanksgiving in all circumstances. Naming the temptation for what it
	is, and the veneer of culture as the false reality clears the way
	for the church to focus on the Spirit and the prophets. The text
	facilitates a focus on prophets as a current event, not as &ldquo;the&rdquo;
	prophets of biblical text only- which gives us an opportunity to
	identify/affirm the prophets in our midst, both in our local
	congregation and in the larger world around us.&nbsp; Focusing on
	the nations economic crisis as a crisis of greed over need (culture
	over compassion) and identifying the voices proclaiming this (Suze
	Orman&nbsp; has been eloquent without being vindictive,
	suzeorman.com ) can facilitate discernment about cultural distortion
	and its effect on our perception of the reality at the core,
	successfully unveiling the effect of God in our midst- which returns
	us to a focus on Emmanuel. Once again, we are pregnant- the child is
	within us, therefore here, yet not yet born, so not here- the choice
	as to how to proceed is ours. Listening to the voices of those who
	thought they were living in the end times throughout history- who
	nonetheless bore faithful witness- generates the hope of being part
	of the only crowd worth belonging to- the throng worshipping the
	Lamb. Validating the perception of chaos in the world has the
	simultaneous effect of validating hope; the hope of Jesus advent
	into each of our personal lives in turbulent times.&nbsp; Rejoicing,
	prayer (as constant communication not whining/demanding) and
	thanksgiving then become logical, not irrational, responses on the
	part of the church to the presence of the Spirit.&nbsp; While the
	Spirit is not limited to the rational, she surely is not irrational
	either, and neither are we in our joy- no matter how real the
	worldly distress we live in. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>Reflections and Questions 
</P>
<P>1. Constant prayer, rejoicing and giving thanks. These are themes
in several of Paul's letters, most notably Philippians 4.
(Philippians is also the letter that most emphasizes positive
imitation.) Are prayerful rejoicing and thanksgiving remedies for
mimetic rivalry? Giving thanks in all circumstances would seem to
counteract the felt lack of things when mimetic rivalry comes
knocking. We live under an economic system which has a basic
assumption that there is a scarcity of goods that must be fairly
distributed. Where does this assumption of scarcity come from? It
comes from mimetic rivalry, doesn't it? When two children are
fighting over a single toy in a room full of toys there seems a
scarcity of toys to them. It would seem that a prayerful attitude of
giving thanks in all circumstances would be to live by a different
basic assumption than scarcity. This might also relate to the theme
of the Jubilee year, whose economic assumptions would also seem to
live according to abundance rather than scarcity.

matters. God&rsquo;s plan for them, realized in Christ, is to

a working in unison with God, and to be thankful to God for his

1:6-8, 19-28</B> John's Gospel contains no story about the birth of
Jesus. The introductory paragraphs set that event in a cosmic context
using metaphors such as Logos (Word), life, light, glory and truth to
describe God's full revelation in Jesus, the Word made flesh. The
focus shifted immediately to John the Baptist and his ministry
preparing the way for Jesus, the light of the world. These excerpts
from John 1 deal exclusively with the role of the Baptist.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The author of
the gospel distinguished John the Baptist from Jesus as the one who
is only a witness to the light. He set the stage for Jesus'
appearance by reiterating this distinction when challenged by the
religious leaders of Israel. Due to the domination of the whole
eastern Mediterranean region, first by Hellenistic and then Roman
imperial power, and the pervasive influence of the Greco-Roman
culture, a plethora of Jewish eschatological writing had appeared in
the late centuries before and first century after the time of Jesus.
Jewish expectations of the Messiah reached a very intense level.
Typical of religious authorities in all ages, the established
priesthood challenged every new prophetic voice. John the Baptist was
no exception (vss. 18-22). </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Jews did not
expect the Messiah to come unannounced. At the end of the very last
book of the OT, the obscure prophet Malachi, of the early 5<SUP>th</SUP>
century BCE, we find a paragraph referring specifically to the
prophet Elijah returning to prepare for &quot;the great and terrible
day of the Lord.&quot; Similarly, Deuteronomy 18:15 contained a
reference to a prophet like Moses who would be raised to whom the
people would give heed. Acts 3:22 and 7:37 show that the apostolic
church believed that Jesus himself fulfilled the messianic promise.
The early church, probably taking their clues from Jewish
contemporaries, interpreted the eschatological &quot;the day of the
Lord&quot; as referring to the coming of Jesus whom the church
claimed to be the Messiah/Christ. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Naturally,
Jewish literature of the period and later did not share this
conviction. Writing toward the end of the lst century CE, the author
of the gospel wrapped this tradition into the challenge of the
Jerusalem priesthood to John the Baptist. He rejected all three
assumptions. He was not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet like
Moses. Instead, the Fourth Gospel followed the tradition of the other
three gospels in applying the opening words of the great prophet of
the Babylonian Exile to the Baptist (Isaiah 40:3).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Skillful writer
that he was, the author of John&rsquo;s Gospel introduced all the key
opposing groups in this introductory chapter. Whereas it first
appeared that &quot;the Jews&quot; had sent the priests and Levites
to accost John the Baptist (vs. 19), these challengers then were said
to be representatives of &quot;the Pharisees&quot; (vs. 24). In other
words, the identity of the opposition had moved from the general to
the specific. The particular concern of the Pharisees was ritual
purity and total adherence to the law of Moses. Jews did not need to
be baptized because they were already &quot;sons of the covenant.&quot;
The forerunners of the Messiah would baptize only those who converted
to the true faith and so became members of the elect people, Israel.
Thus, John&rsquo;s ministry of preaching repentance leading to
baptism was all wrong from the Pharisees point of view (vs. 25).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Baptist&rsquo;s
reply clarified the distinction between the Jewish and Christian
views of his ministry. Whereas his baptism with water symbolized a
cleansing in preparation for the coming of the Messiah, there was one
among them as yet unknown who would fulfill all the their messianic
expectations. In subsequent decades, as the author of the Fourth
Gospel well knew when he wrote, the greatest threat to the infant
church had come not so much from the imperial powers of Rome, but
from the Jewish religious authorities in Jerusalem and the growing
influence of the Pharisees in the synagogues of the Jewish Diaspora.
The central issue in that struggle was whether or not Jesus of
Nazareth was the promised Messiah. Like the rest of the NT, the
Fourth Gospel had placed this issue at its very core. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">One of the
features of the Fourth Gospel is its curious way of defining where
specific events took place. Vs. 28 places the locale of John&rsquo;s
baptistry &quot;in Bethany across the Jordan.&quot; That has a
symbolic meaning: By passing through the waters of the Jordan in
baptism, those who responded to John&rsquo;s call for repentance
symbolically repeated the entrance of God&rsquo;s covenant people
into the holy land. Some texts including the KJV and its source
documents name the place Bethabara. Scholars believe that in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
century after knowledge of the actual site had been lost, apparently
forever, Origen made a textual correction which was subsequently
maintained in other manuscripts.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Another
controversy has recently arisen about this site of a political and
economic nature. If this location for John&rsquo;s ministry is
accurate, it lay on the eastern side of the river, currently within
Jordanian territory. A site on the west bank has traditionally been
afforded that honor. But that site has been closed to pilgrimages and
heavily mined against terrorist intrusion since the Six Day War of
1967 when Israel occupied the West Bank. Working with a Roman
Catholic priest&rsquo;s archeological research to guide them,
Jordanian archeologists have expensively developed a site on Wadi
Kharrar, an eastern tributary of the Jordan, marked by baptismal
pools and church ruins dating from the 4<SUP>th</SUP> to the 15<SUP>th</SUP>
centuries. The Israeli government quickly responded to this challenge
by refurbishing the west bank site within a secure military
reservation to compete for anticipated tourist dollars. Two
millennium after John, controversy still rages over his baptism.</FONT></P>

<DIV ID="anthropological" DIR="LTR">
	<P><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="anthropological" --><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>Once
	again, the theme which has formed the backdrop for the last two
	Sundays, namely persecution, is also to be found in the foreground
	and background of our text. A &ldquo;reading from below&rdquo; is
	possible only when we &ldquo;learn that personal suffering is a more
	effective key, a more rewarding principle for exploring the world in
	thought and action than personal good fortune&rdquo; (Bonhoeffer,
	Letters and Papers from Prison). Suffering as a hermeneutical
	principle is as important as any grammatical or historical tool
	brought to textual exegesis. In both the Markan and the Johannine
	traditions, the Spirit is bound up with a theology of the cross. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>This is an absolutely
	essential element to grasp for it is the hermeneutic that alone
	unlocks Scripture. The Spirit, God as self interpreted to us, each
	of us and all of us, and the death of Jesus of Nazareth, are
	inseparable. It is God in Christ we see &lsquo;reconciling the
	declared enemy, the world to God&rsquo;s self.&rdquo; When we
	approach Scripture from this perspective, we can agree with
	Bonhoeffer that &ldquo;personal suffering&rdquo; or &ldquo;a
	hermeneutic from below&rdquo; is the way we are to read God&rsquo;s
	story in Scripture. The theme of Holy Scripture is the suffering
	God, suffering Love.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The early church
	interpreted their Canon this way and they articulated this way of
	rendering Scripture. Iso Lesbaupin reminds us that virtually every
	document collected in the New Testament was written from the
	perspective of the persecuted, from the perspective of the community
	of, not simply the victim, else Nietzsche would be right, but they
	knew themselves to be the community of the Victim Vindicated! Thus
	forgiveness of enemies, as practiced by Jesus became their hallmark
	(for the most part). They had received the Holy Spirit, the Spirit
	of the Crucified.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The promised coming of
	the Spirit creates a link between the Synoptics and the Johannine
	Gospels. A hermeneutical perspective is given: the Cross is both
	revelation and reconciliation, the revelation is reconciliatory, the
	reconciliation is revelatory (as Barth would say). In effect, the
	text gives its own hermeneutic, the one by which it can most
	effectively be read. This perspective is aptly called &ldquo;the
	view from below&rdquo; (Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison).
	</FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>This view from below is
	of no little consequence, because it immediately identifies the
	revelation of violence, and this revelation is that a conquering is
	occurring in the cross, a conquering of sin, death and the devil.
	Again, as the hermeneutical key when reading the texts, it is
	important to remember that the sporadic and localized persecutions
	of Christians have left their memory in these documents. In the case
	of the 4G, to bear witness, marturein, is a legal term. The modern
	connotation of &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; may not have been a part of the
	evangelist&rsquo;s semantic sphere. However, by the end of the first
	century, those legally charged as &lsquo;threats to the State&rsquo;
	were often given a trial before the thundering crowds of the Roman
	(and other) coliseums. Their witness for Jesus would cost them their
	lives. </FONT></FONT>

	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The singularity of the
	death of Jesus, its cause and consequences permeate the 4G, in its
	metaphors, its allusions and its double meanings. Beginning with the
	&lsquo;rejection&rsquo; by his own, through the death plots and
	narrow escapes, to the prophecy of the High Priest, and the betrayal
	of one of his own, this gospel winds it way around the cross. Good
	Friday is Pentecost in the 4G in that the Spirit is poured out in
	the death of Jesus (7:37-39). If Jesus does not &lsquo;go away&rsquo;,
	he cannot come to us or send the Spirit of his Father. The baptism
	of the Cross and the baptism of the Spirit are one. </FONT></FONT>

Historical/Cultural Questions</FONT></FONT></STRONG></P>
<DIV ID="historicalcultural" DIR="LTR">
	<P><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="historical-cultural" --><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>As
	we pointed out last week, the 4G&rsquo;s (John&rsquo;s Gospel, the
	&ldquo;Fourth Gospel) portrait of John the Baptist (JTB) is quite
	different than that of the Synoptics. Where the Synoptics portray
	JTB as an apocalyptic preacher and baptizer, The 4G highlights the
	witness of JTB. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>In both the Synoptics and
	the 4G, the quotation from the prophet Isaiah is used to place John
	in relation to Jesus. The Synoptic (= Petrine) slant on JTB places
	him in a salvation-historical framework, that is, John is the
	penultimate in a series of prophets who have been sent to Israel.
	JTB&rsquo;s ministry was so successful that he is not only placed at
	the beginning of the &lsquo;gospel tradition,&rsquo; he also merits
	admiration from Josephus. It is also possible that JTB&rsquo;s
	disciples formed small communities, one of which apparently migrated
	to Asia Minor (as reflected in Acts 19). If so, those who see an
	undermining of the Baptist&rsquo;s popularity in the 4G might well
	be correct. However, it is important in this regard to observe that
	John and Jesus are not portrayed as rivals. The Baptist is never
	denigrated in the Gospel tradition. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>In fact, Jesus&rsquo;
	execution is foreshadowed by JTB&rsquo;s execution and thus links
	Jesus to the Baptist and the other Hebrew Prophets. This is the
	witness of the Baptist. The use of the title &lsquo;Lamb of God&rsquo;
	has several potential antecedents: sacrificial lambs, the Passover
	Lamb, the eschatological Lamb (Rev. 5). Whatever the case, sacrifice
	is involved. Jesus&rsquo; appearance is the distinctive (not unique)
	revelation of this sacrificial system and its origins in mimetic
	violence. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The eschatological
	warning of human-generated violence and the eschatological promise
	of the Spirit culminate in the Third Sunday in Advent. But the
	promise triumphs the warning. Here in week 3, JTB stands as a
	witness. He himself is not the reality, but the witness that his
	ministry and message would diminish and pale by comparison with &ldquo;the
	One mightier than I.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>In the 4G there is no
	clear indication of JTB&rsquo;s message. It is strictly his function
	as God&rsquo;s witness to point to God&rsquo;s emissary, Jesus.
	Unlike the Synoptics, in the 4G Jesus baptizes at the same time as
	JTB, and in fact Jesus creates quite a stir when he develops a
	greater following. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The Synoptic tradition
	has even identified John with Elijah in the chronological scheme of
	apocalyptic Judaism. The 4G knows no such framework. It is possible,
	as suggested earlier, that the community that produced this gospel
	had some contacts with groups who esteemed the Baptist. But it may
	be preferable to suggest that this community is intentionally
	undermining the potentially misleading apocalyptic framework placed
	on the gospel narrative in the Synoptic tradition. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The verses selected for
	the lectionary reading reflect a text embedded in one of the most
	beautiful Christian pieces of poetry or hymnody. The Introductory
	Poem to the 4G, 1:1-18, is an extraordinarily textured combination
	of, as it were, a midrash on Genesis 1, a reflection on Logos
	theory, Wisdom/Logos/Torah personification, all woven in an
	elegantly balanced structure and style. If we read verses 6-8,
	followed by verse 15, then verse 19, we can see a connected
	narrative opening around which the Poem has been placed. We can also
	see better the internal connections in the Poem. The lectionary
	reading of verses 6-8 and 19-28 parallels this observation.</FONT></FONT></P>

	read &quot;mightier&quot; from below. Can we seriously preach that
	weakness and vulnerability are the strength that is stronger than
	human strength? We wonder if we can preach anything else. </FONT></FONT>

	<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>I will put it bluntly, as

	liberalism lacks the Spirit, conservatives lack the cross. The split
	between Jesus and the Cross is the hallmark of Gnosticism. The
	Christ Spirit hovers above the suffering human Jesus&hellip;and
	laughs! Why? Because suffering, material reality, is not real. Real
	reality is spirit and cannot suffer or change. A lot is missed when
	we fail to see that we preach a suffering God, who has suffered and
	still suffers with us, as with Jesus. He suffers in every little

	Christianity, if it wishes to preach gospel, good news, will point
	out that the One who comes, Emmanuel, comes from below, from what
	Tony Bartlett would call the abyss of love. Jesus&rsquo; descent
	into the abyss of the cross was also a descent into the abyss of the

	Christianity is not about victims, per se, but about what happens to
	a victim who is wholly taken with the Lord; about what happens to
	Jesus, but what also happens to us, when we forgive our enemies. The
	Christian choice for nonviolence and peacemaking is only possible
	when it is understood beforehand that one forgives as one has been
	forgiven. When victims forgive, the reality is spoken, there can be
	no more war, there is no more enemy. You might say that the church

	anti-Semitism in the Gospels. As I mentioned in last week's notes,
	John the Baptist plays a prominent role as the other murder most
	closely akin to the Passion in the synoptic gospels. The theme of
	these two articles is very important, I think: namely, that the
	violence of the cross is not a unique violence. A twist to much
	teaching that has gone under the name of Christian has been to
	attempt making the cross unique in every fashion. But hasn't that
	led to a sacrificial reading in which Jesus' Father was willing to
	sacrifice him? Rather, says Girard, the gospels are trying to show
	us how the violence revealed in the cross is structurally identical
	to much of the violence since the foundation of the world. It's
	violence is not unique. John the Baptist is the closest forerunner
	in the sense that he will die the same type of violent death.

	</P>
	<P>Reflections and Questions 
	</P>
	<P>1. A striking feature of this lectionary text is how it has been
	taken out of the wider context of John 1. The strong element of
	rejection and victimization has been left out so that the passage
	more closely resembles the synoptic accounts introducing us to John
	the Baptist. The preacher may want to add them back in. 
	</P>
	<P>2. As we said above, mimetic theory interprets John's murder on a
	continuum with Jesus'. The cross is not unique in its violence. Yet
	this John the Baptist material has John emphasize his difference
	from Jesus. Why is that? Is this to reflect a situation of
	non-rivalry? The theme of Jesus' deference to his Father in heaven
	is also very strong in John's gospel. John defers to Jesus; Jesus
	defers to the Father. There is no mimetic rivalry here. 
	</P>
	<P>3. Yet how do we characterize, or interpret John's own
	characterization of, the difference between John and Jesus,
	especially in light of pointing to the sameness in their murders?
	Once again these verses out of context from the rest of John 1 do us
	a disservice. We do not catch that Jesus will baptize with the Holy
	Spirit (vs. 33), which in John's gospel is the Paraclete, the
	Defense Attorney, who will reveal Jesus' innocence. The role of the
	Holy Spirit in those murders would seem to constitute the difference
	between them. With John's murder, we don't yet come to fully see his
	innocence as a structural feature of the scapegoating mechanism;
	with the help of the Holy Spirit, we do come to see this about
	Jesus' murder. 
	</P>
	<P>Another possibility: As mentioned last week, Gil Bailie suggests
	that a crucial part of the difference is that John lets himself get
	into a relationship of scandal with Herod Antipas.
