<P><STRONG>PROVERBS 22:1-2, 8-9, 22-23. </STRONG>The Book of Proverbs
consists of Jewish wisdom sayings and poems collected and edited by
some unknown author(s), probably in the 5th century BC or later. It
may well have been educational document intended to guide serious
students along paths of righteousness, intelligence and human
fulfilment. The emphasis on social justice found in Israel&rsquo;s
great prophets, especially Isaiah and Amos, stands out clearly in
these selected doublets. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>PSALM 125. </STRONG>This is another of the Songs of
Ascent, most likely sung by pilgrims approaching Jerusalem and the
temple. Mountains do indeed surround Jerusalem as vs. 2 states. This
provides a fitting symbol for the protection God provides for Israel.
The rest of the psalm restates Israel&rsquo;s religious tradition:
righteousness that fulfils the nation&rsquo;s covenant relationship
with God.</P>
<P><STRONG>ISAIAH 35:4-7A.</STRONG> (Alternate) This is another
passage which envisions the Shalom of God, God&rsquo;s reign of
peace, justice and love. To a people who had suffered frequently from
invasion, subjugation and exile, this imaginative prophecy would have
brought great comfort. More recent visions of Utopian societies draw
much from Old Testament passages like this.</P>
<P><STRONG>PSALM 146. </STRONG>(Alternate) This brief psalm of
praise, one of the five that end the Psalter, celebrates the hopes of
Israel in God&rsquo;s desire for freedom and justice. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>JAMES 2:1-10, 14-17.</STRONG> A rhetorical question in vs.
1 states the thesis of this brief homily: favoring the wealthy
creates social injustice. The next three verses illustrate the issue.
Vv. 5-7 sets out God&rsquo;s will in this regard in another series of
rhetorical questions. James puts this in a scriptural context in vv.
8-11 and then summarizes his argument in vv. 12-13. 
</P>
<P>Beginning in vv. 14, James deals with the implications for faith
of this ethical principle. Faith that does not produce good works is
a false faith. An intellectual religious commitment without
corresponding changes to one&rsquo;s moral life cannot be a saving
faith.<BR><STRONG><BR>MARK 7:24-37.</STRONG> Two healing miracles, at
least one of them on foreign territory, give rise to instructions
from Jesus to keep his presence and his power secret. The attempt to
heal failed, as vs. 36 points out.<BR><STRONG><BR>A MORE COMPLETE
ANALYSIS.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>PROVERBS 22:1-2, 8-9, 22-23.</STRONG> The Book of Proverbs
consists of Jewish wisdom sayings and poems collected and edited by
some unknown author(s), probably in the 5th century BC or later. It
may well have been educational document intended to guide serious
students along paths of righteousness, intelligence and human
fulfilment. During the post-exilic Persian, and especially the
Hellenstic domination of Israel after 330 BCE, there was strong
pressure on Jewish young people to adopt syncretist religious and
cultural practices. The ancestral traditions needed to be reinforced
more effectively. This became the primary purpose of the Book of
Proverbs.</P>
<P>As a teaching compendium, the redactors intended students to learn
and recite by rote these doublets and poems in much the same way that
we learned children&rsquo;s nursery rhymes. Its collection came long
after the use of these sayings had been orally transmitted from
generation to generation. The book contains unsurpassed insights into
human affairs of all kinds, especially in relation to social and
religious matters. Attributed to Solomon, many of these sayings may
well have been common currency in his time (10th century BCE). Their
enduring moral and spiritual value is attested by their use in the
oral traditions of many religious cultures until recent times. Sadly,
however, as the knowledge of and reading of scripture has declined in
western civilization, so has the use of this proverbial wisdom. 
</P>
<P>These excerpts actually represent the end of a second collection
of proverbs and the beginning of a third which scholars have
identified within the book The break appears at 22:17 as the title
phrase, &ldquo;The words of the wise &hellip;&rdquo; and the
succeeding lines of poetry indicate (vss. 17-23). There is reason to
believe that this third collection is based on a very similar
Egyptian document dated about 1000 BCE.</P>
<P>The emphasis on social justice found in Israel&rsquo;s great
prophets, especially Isaiah and Amos, stands out clearly in these
selected doublets. A strong element of legalistic righteousness has
been blended in to create a sense of moral justification for
good<BR>behavior resulting in good fortune.</P>
<P><STRONG>PSALM 125. </STRONG>As we have seen in previous readings,
this is another of the Songs of Ascent (Pss. 120-134) most likely
sung by pilgrims approaching Jerusalem and the temple. Mountains do
indeed surround Jerusalem as v. 2 states. Mount Zion is only one of
several on which Jerusalem is situated. Originally, it was the
location of the fortress which David successfully captured (2 Samuel
5:6-10). The temple Solomon built stood, not on Mount Zion, but on
Mount Moriah, where the Islamic Dome of the Rock is now situated. 
</P>
<P>In later Hebrew prophesy and poetry, Zion became a symbolic name
for Yahweh&rsquo;s holy city in which the temple stood. This provided
a fitting symbol for Yahweh&rsquo;s protection of Israel just as the
mountains surrounding Jerusalem served as sentinels for the city&rsquo;s
security. 
</P>
<P>The rest of the psalm, composed in post-exilic times, restates
Israel&rsquo;s religious tradition: righteousness fulfils the
nation&rsquo;s covenant relationship with Yahweh. Two distinct groups
of people are identified: those who put their trust in Yahweh and
those who have associated with the godless. The phrase &ldquo;the
sceptre of wickedness&rdquo; in vs. 3 hints that the latter group may
have included some powerful Israelites who may have conspired with
foreigners thereby endangering the nation&rsquo;s independence. 
</P>
<P>Recently, a Jewish rabbi described his tradition as a religion of
morality. Many church folk mistakenly define their religious
convictions in similar terms. But that is not what the Christian
scriptures describe. Much as we respect our Jewish neighbors, mere
morality doesn&rsquo;t make it. Ours is a redemptive or salvatory
faith tradition, rooted nonetheless in the continual historical
redemption of Israel by God. It rests on repentance for moral failure
to which all succumb, the gracious forgiveness of God and the renewal
of life acceptable to God through faith in Jesus Christ, who is God
incarnate in human form and a present power in us through the gift of
the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>ISAIAH 35:4-7A. </STRONG>(Alternate) This is another
passage which envisions the Shalom of God, God&rsquo;s reign of
peace, justice and love. To a people who had suffered frequently from
invasion, subjugation and exile, this imaginative prophecy would have
brought great comfort. More recent visions of Utopian societies draw
much from Old Testament passages like this.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This exultant lyric of confidence and joy,&rdquo; to quote
my late professor of OT, Dr. R.B.Y. Scott, (<EM>Interpreter&rsquo;s
Bible. 5.358</EM>) includes parts of the two main themes of the poem:
the manifestation of Yahweh as deliverer of Yahweh&rsquo;s helpless,
exiled people and their joyful return to Zion. The passage exudes
confidence, giving expression to the indomitable faith that has
withstood the innumerable shocks of history for three millennia. If
it any verse is to be made the text for a sermon (e.g. vs. 4), it
would be appropriate to read the whole poem rather than this brief
excerpt. 
</P>
<P>Obviously the poem dates from a time near the end of Babylonian
exile (539 BCE) and would be more appropriate as part of
Deutero-Isaiah (Isa. 40-66). With the eschatological poem in ch. 34,
it had at some unknown time been attached the prophecies of Isaiah,
who lived in the 8th century BCE.</P>
<P>The images of vss. 5-6a may seem exaggerated until we recall very
similar words of Jesus to the disciples of John the Baptist when they
came asking if he was indeed the Messiah (Matt. 11:2-6; Luke
7:18-23). It is possible that Jesus had this passage in mind when he
uttered those words, although the image is of the most helpless and
vulnerable having the most cause to praise God.</P>
<P>The restoration of ecological wholeness envisaged in vss. 6a-7a
can be seen in the way modern Israel has reclaimed parts of the Negev
desert in southern Israel for agriculture. Even in the inhospitably
arid Dead Sea valley, there are fruitful plantations of date palms
growing because of careful irrigation from ancient springs. Similarly
fruitful farming land is being redeemed from the Negev desert through
careful irrigation. At the same time, the limited water resources of
the region are not shared equitably between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. With environmental disasters multiplying in many parts
of the world, our generation must turn our minds and wills to similar
reclamation projects from which all people may benefit.</P>
<P><STRONG>PSALM 146. </STRONG>(Alternate) This brief psalm of
praise, one of the five hallelujah psalms that end the Psalter,
celebrates the hopes of Israel in God&rsquo;s desire for freedom and
justice. 
</P>
<P>The outstanding aspect of this psalm is its central theme that
only God, not human power and politics, can be trusted to provide
hope and help in resolving the basic problems of society. No more
succinct definition of this moral and spiritual truth can be found
than in vss. 3-4. Even the greatest leaders, despite their best
intentions, cannot meet the needs suffering humanity. If ever there
was a time in history when this message needs to be shouted from the
roof tops, that time in now. 
</P>
<P>The psalm concludes with a proclamation that Yahweh is the Lord of
history, a message to be found throughout the OT. At the same time,
in this day of global conflicts pitting powerful religious traditions
against one another in apparent struggle for world domination, this
may be difficult to imagine. On the other hand, the scriptures give
voice to faith and hope, not geopolitical anxieties.</P>
<P><STRONG>JAMES 2:1-10, 14-17.</STRONG> A rhetorical question in vs.
1 in the NSRV states the thesis of this brief homily: favoring the
wealthy creates social injustice. Most translations do not render
this opening sentence as a question. Original Greek manuscripts had
no punctuation and used only capital letters. Thus it is a moot point
whether or not this was a question or a strong admonition to the
recipients of the letter.</P>
<P>The first segment of this reading, however, has the form of a
sermon regarding what undoubtedly was a serious problem in early
Christian communities. Acts 4:32-5:11 gives a specific instance of
the possible dangers wealthy believers brought to any congregation.
The great prophets of Israel, Amos, Isaiah and Micah had railed
against the same economic inequities and injustices. As the
Deuteronomists clearly emphasized in their interpretation of the
Mosaic Law, exilic and post-exilic Israel faced similar problems. In
this they differed not a whit from modern western civilization which
gave rise to the inequities of capitalist economies and socialist
class struggles for a more equitable distribution of wealth.</P>
<P>The reality still exists for contemporary Christian churches. In
many Ontario towns and cities, different congregations of the same
denomination have been identified with wealthier professional and
managerial classes or the laboring classes who live in different
parts of the same community with different standards of housing. 
</P>
<P>One young minister and his bride were tracked down at their
supposedly secret honeymoon location and invited to appear for an
interview for a post in a wealthy church. They were hosted and
feasted far above what they could afford. After the interview they
were promised that following a suitable period as assistant to the
senior minister, they could have any pastorate they chose. They felt
that all that was required of them was due deference to the rich and
influential members of this particular congregation. The young couple
refused the tempting opportunity without regret. In later years,
though they called to serve in a much wealthier community than their
first pastorate, they never felt completely at home. 
</P>
<P>Vv. 5-7 sets out God&rsquo;s will in this regard in another series
of rhetorical questions. Christian are called to demonstrate a
different set of values. James puts this in a scriptural context in
vv. 8-11 and then summarizes his argument in vv. 12-13. Injustice
brings judgment, not on the basis of human economic standards, but on
God&rsquo;s sense of equity. 
</P>
<P>Beginning in vv. 14, James deals with the implications for faith
of this ethical principle. Faith that does not produce good works is
a false faith. An intellectual commitment without corresponding
changes to one&rsquo;s moral life cannot be a saving faith. Some
interpreters have drawn a sharp distinction between Paul&rsquo;s
theology of grace alone and James&rsquo; theology of faith plus
works. Others have made a similar distinction between Judaism and
Christianity. These are both false antitheses. The debate which both
Paul and James engage in can be found also in pre-Christian Jewish
literature and in the writings of Philo of Alexandria, a contemporary
of Jesus. All held that both faith and works of righteousness
contributed to salvation.</P>
<P>Contrary to what some claim, Paul did not proclaim a doctrine of
justification by faith alone without any subsequent response to
demonstrate that justification had brought about changed behavior. In
fact, Paul clearly rejected such a view as blasphemous (Rom. 3:8 and
6:1-2). Nor did he condemn the &ldquo;Judaizers&rdquo; of Galatia, or
even Peter, for holding a similar viewpoint. If there is any
discrepancy between Paul and James, it is between a false Paulinism
and James&rsquo; position. A distortion of what Paul taught about the
sufficiency of grace that results in moral transformation may well
have been evident in the communities for which this letter was
written. B.S. Easton presents a detailed exegesis of this issue in
<EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible</EM>, 12, 40-42.</P>
<P><STRONG><BR>MARK 7:24-37.</STRONG> Two healing miracles, at least
one of them on foreign territory, gave rise to instructions from
Jesus to keep his presence and his power secret. The attempt at
secrecy failed, as v. 36 points out. 
</P>
<P>Tyre was an important Mediterranean seaport in what is we know as
Lebanon. Originally an island, it was connected to the mainland by a
great mole built by Alexander during his siege of the city in 333
BCE. Early in his ministry, Jesus had preached to people from there
(Mark 3:8). Thus, it is fair to speculate that he may have gone there
to visit someone he knew. In any small community, gossip would have
made his presence known, especially if his host had been particularly
impressed with his teaching and honoured by his visit. Jesus, on the
other hand, wanted to keep his visit a secret (vs. 24b), but to no
avail.</P>
<P>We can also assume that Jesus&rsquo; host was a Jew, but his
neighbors included many Gentiles, as was the Syrophoenecian woman who
came to him pleading for her daughter to be healed. Neither the
disease nor the demon which, according to contemporary belief, had
caused it, nor the manner of healing interested Mark. He chose to
emphasize the conversation between the woman and Jesus. The elements
of the pericope may have come from tradition; the actual words were
from Mark who had his audience in mind. 
</P>
<P>The narrative reveals a particular aspect of Jesus&rsquo;
humanity: his willingness to be convinced, even by a Gentile woman,
that God&rsquo;s saving love extended beyond the covenanted people of
Israel. This could well have been a significant issue for Mark&rsquo;s
audience, particularly if they were a mix of Jews and Gentiles. 
</P>
<P>The second miracle (vss. 31-35) occurred after Jesus had returned
from Tyre. It is curious that he &ldquo;went by way of Sidon towards
the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Decapolis.&rdquo; That was quite
a voyage to make on foot. Sidon in north of Tyre on the Mediterranean
coast, about 40 miles northwest of the Sea of Galilee. Decapolis lies
southeast of the Sea of Galilee across the Jordan valley. He
certainly was taking the long road home. Or Mark may not have known
the geography of Galilee very well. Another possibility presents
itself in this strange route: Mark may be pointing out for the
benefit of his audience that it was not unusual for Jesus, a Jew from
Galilee, to traverse and minister in Gentile territory.</P>
<P>The central message of the pericope, however, is the miracle
itself and the effort Jesus made to keep it secret. It has important
links to the motif in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel which scholars have
designated as &ldquo;the messianic secret.&rdquo; This interpretation
actually deals with the various levels of redaction through which the
oral tradition passed in being transmitted and ultimately recorded
for reading or hearing by future generations. However explicitly Mark
may have described the incident, we have no way of knowing how Jesus
healed this deaf and dumb man. Nor does that really matter. 
</P>
<P>The pericope presents the modern reader with the same question it
posed for the original audience for whom Mark wrote: who is this
Jesus of Nazareth? The miracles that so amazed people then and still
trouble us now, probably for very different reasons, describe
transcendent events. These were not merely good deeds by an
exceptionally skilled, charismatic and caring healer. They caused
everyone then &ndash; and they still cause us &ndash; to choose
either to believe or disbelieve that Jesus is as Mark proclaimed in
the very first words of his gospel: &ldquo;Jesus Christ, the Son of
God.&rdquo;</P>
