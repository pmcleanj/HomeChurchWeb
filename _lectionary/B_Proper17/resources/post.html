<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the
towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? And they answered, John
the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. And he charged
them that they should tell no man of him.<BR>And he began to teach
them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of
the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and
after three days rise again. And he spake that saying openly. And
Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. But when he had turned about
and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee
behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God,
but the things that be of men.<BR>And when he had called the people
unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but
whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own soul? </I>
