<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
giving of the Ten Commandments marks the starting point of Israel as
a self-defining community. They form a covenant between God and
Israel but, unlike God's agreements with Noah and Abraham, here both
parties have a stake in it, and either can break it.</FONT></P>
<P>The Israelites have arrived at Mount Sinai. They clean themselves
physically and ritually, but it is Moses and Aaron who ascend the
mountain. God speaks to <U>all</U>, to the whole community. He enters
into the pact because &ldquo;you shall be for me a ... holy nation&rdquo;
(<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+19%3A6">19:6</A>).
They are to have &ldquo;no other gods before [or beside] me&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A3">3</A>).
In the ancient Near East, people commonly encountered gods in
sculpted images, but the Israelites are not to do this (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A4">4</A>),
because God is different: he demands loyalty to him alone (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A5">5</A>);
he punishes for a long time those who intentionally &ldquo;reject&rdquo;
him, but rewards with compassion those who love him and follow his
ways. Those who use God&rsquo;s name for a false or evil purpose
(e.g. for casting spells, doing magic) will not be <EM>acquitted</EM>
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A7">7</A>)
or <EM>held harmless</EM>. Each week, time is to be reserved for
praying to, and worshipping, God. The Israelites must honour older
people; doing so will contribute to their own longevity. Then vv.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A13-17">13-17</A>:
life, marriage and property are sacred. Testifying falsely against
another (or even spreading innuendos) is prohibited. Even coveting,
<EM>desiring greatly,</EM> the possessions of others is prohibited.
This scene of God&rsquo;s presence among humans ends as it began (in
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+19%3A16-19">19:16-19</A>)
with &ldquo;thunder and lightning&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A18">18</A>),
trumpet blasts and &ldquo;the mountain smoking&rdquo;. There being no
evidence of vulcanism on the Sinai Peninsula, scholars think the
description is poetic rather than literal: perhaps of a mountain
storm in which God is present. In <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+19%3A2-25">19:2-25</A>
God has appointed Moses as intermediary; in v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+20%3A19">19</A>,
the people accept Moses&rsquo; role.</P>

and that vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+19%3A7-14">7-14</A>,
praising the revelation of God in the Law, were added later in order
to counterbalance what seemed to be an almost pagan influence upon
the revelation of God in nature; however <A HREF="javascript:reference('NJBC')">NJBC</A>
considers that the thematic connections show that this psalm has
always been one poem. He views the Law as one of God&rsquo;s works.
Note the change in divine names at v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+19%3A7">7</A>:

has warned his readers about those who try to convince them that
being a Christian requires acceptance of Jewish law, including
circumcision. True circumcision is </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=3>of the
heart</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=3> &ndash; and not of the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo;,
i.e. following legal precepts, as in Judaism. Inner circumcision is
what is required of us.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>He cites his own experience as an example. In early life, he was
as true to Judaism as anyone could be: he was circumcised; he is from
the elite tribe (&ldquo;Benjamin&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A5">5</A>),
as Jewish as one can be (&ldquo;a Hebrew born of Hebrews&rdquo;);
like other Pharisees, he knew the Law well and applied it in daily
life. He zealously persecuted Christians and faultlessly kept the
Law. And yet, knowing Christ has made him realize that a Jewish,
law-based, approach to God is a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; (vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A7-8">7-8</A>)
for Christians: it obstructs God&rsquo;s free gift of love. True
&ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A9">9</A>)
comes through &ldquo;faith in Christ&rdquo;, not self-assessment of
godliness, per legal precepts. He has cast aside all his Jewishness
in order to realize the gain Christ offers (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A8">8</A>).</P>

sharing his sufferings and participating in his death. Out of this,
he will come to know &ldquo;the power of his resurrection&rdquo;. He
is still working on understanding Christ completely (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A12">12</A>),

Paul&rsquo;s attitude towards those who considered circumcision a
requirement for being a Christian is clear: he writes in Galatians

&ldquo;I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!&rdquo;.

Here, the landowner stands for God, the first tenants for Israel&rsquo;s
leaders, and the time the landowner is away for their period of
stewardship of God&rsquo;s chosen people. So the second tenants are
replacements for Israel, probably those who follow Christ. Is Jesus

<P><EM>Verse 35</EM>: &ldquo;beat one, killed another, and stoned

almost directly quotes the opening lines of Isaiah&rsquo;s parable
(<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+5%3A1-7">5:1-7</A>,
the Song of the Unfruitful Vineyard) makes these equations certain.
[<A HREF="javascript:reference('Blomberg')">Blomberg</A>]</P>
<P><A HREF="javascript:reference('Blomberg')">Blomberg</A> sees this
parable as making three points:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God is patient and long suffering
	in waiting for his people to bear the fruit which he expects of
	them, even when they are repeatedly and overtly hostile in their
	rebellion against him. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A day will come when God&rsquo;s
	patience will be exhausted and those who have rejected him will be
	destroyed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>God&rsquo;s purposes will not thereby be thwarted, for he
	will raise up new leaders who will produce the fruit the original
	ones failed to provide. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>While elements in most parables approach the absurd (causing the
first listeners to break into hearty laughter) such hostilities as
described here were not uncommon in first-century conflicts between
absentee landlords (especially Roman ones) and their tenants &ndash;
so this parable may look extreme but it is not. [<A HREF="javascript:reference('Blomberg')">Blomberg</A>]</P>
<P STYLE="border-top: none; border-bottom: 1.10pt double #000000; border-left: none; border-right: none; padding-top: 0in; padding-bottom: 0.03in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in">
<A HREF="javascript:reference('Blomberg')">Blomberg</A> notes that
there is nothing in the text to identify the son as Jesus. In Jesus&rsquo;
telling of the parable, this is true, but I consider that in
Matthew&rsquo;s hands (and to his audience), the son is Jesus.</P>
<P>Foreign absentee landlords controlled much of the land in Judea
and Galilee in the time of Jesus. The tenant farmers, who rented
these lands, naturally held considerable resentment towards these
rich and powerful (and often foreign and pagan) landowners. The
Zealot party, a band of guerrillas who fought to overthrow foreign
domination, stirred up opposition that occasionally became violent,
just as the action of the tenants in the parable. Killing the heir of
the property might be a way of getting possession of it. By law, in
the absence of an heir, ownership would fall to the first occupant.
In the parable, the workers made the mistake of forgetting that the
owner, upon his return, could give his land to others.</P>
<P>Jesus may have originally addressed this parable to the leaders of
the Zealot party, to emphasize that their goals and methods were
alien to the true kingdom of God. Injustice in human affairs there
might be, and we cannot be indifference in our efforts to bring about
justice. But the justice of God&rsquo;s kingdom cannot come about
through partisan violence and hatred. The leaders of the Zealots,
then, would have been identified with the vineyard workers, and
because of their infidelity to the true purposes of God&rsquo;s
kingdom, their responsibility would be given to others.</P>

In the course of the first few decades of the Church, the Zealot
question was no longer a burning issue, but the Jewish-Gentile
problem remained. By the time the Gospel was written, the emphasis of
the parable seems to have changed. The workers were now seen to
represent the Jews who had rejected Christ, and therefore were
unfaithful to their &quot;chosen&quot; status. And so the kingdom
itself was taken from them and given to the Gentiles. It also became
an explanation of the reasons for Christ&rsquo;s death, and its
consequences &mdash; he was rejected and put to death because he was
a threat to the personal security of Jewish leaders as God&rsquo;s
favored people.</P>
