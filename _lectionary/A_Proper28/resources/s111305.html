<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>1 Thessalonians 5:1-11

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Alive in Christ

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“…whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him.”

<P>Questions:
<BR> Last week’s passage from Paul’s First Letter to the Thessalonians responded to questions and perhaps anxieties of the early Christians who watched their fellow believers die before the return of Jesus.  This week’s passage continues the reflection on this great event to come, this distinguishing mark of Christian belief, this root of our expectant hope.  We now live in an age that tries to alert us to threats and possibilities of terrorist attacks, and we even have a color-coded system to notify us that we should be prepared, although there is usually very little we can do except to be afraid.  The unknown is unnerving, and believers throughout the centuries, today just as much as in the first century, if not more, would like to know exactly when the return of Jesus might be expected.  Perhaps it is worthwhile to consider how we would change our lives today if we knew this coming were indeed happening in our lifetime, as these earliest Christians expected.  Would we change our ways, on the other hand, if we knew Jesus would not return for two thousand more years?  In an age and culture of 30-year mortgages and 60-month CD’s, do we consider “the day of the Lord” relevant?  Paul almost refuses to address the “when” of Jesus’ return: “I don’t think, friends, that I need to deal with the question of when all this is going to happen.  You know as well as I that the day of the Master’s coming can’t be posted on our calendars.  He won’t call ahead and make an appointment any more than a burglar would” (The Message, translated by Eugene Peterson).  Perhaps many members of our churches never give this question a second thought, while others live in uneasy fear.  It seems that Paul is warning us against either route.  Instead, and perhaps paradoxically, we should be aware on one level at all times that the past, present, and future are all in God’s hands, that all things will unfold in God’s time and God’s way, and therefore be prepared for a sudden and dramatic turn of events that will undoubtedly strike fear in the hearts of many.  And yet, believers, children of the daylight and clear vision and wakeful alertness, should live in joy and confidence because we see the big picture, the assurance of sharing God’s life and our ultimate salvation.  We should encourage one another with that shared reassurance, and not worry about the details of timetables and schedules.  Even if we die before that great day, we are still alive with Christ.  According to Eugene Peterson, Paul is “prodding us to continue to live forward in taut and joyful expectancy for what God will do next in Jesus” (The Message).  John Dominic Crossan’s exploration of the word “parousia” sheds more light on the “now” of this way of living:  “The parousia of the Lord was not about destruction of earth and relocation to heaven, but about a world in which violence and injustice are transformed into purity and holiness” (In Search of Paul, with Jonathan L. Reed).  How have you viewed the “end of the world” or the “day of the Lord” in your life of faith?  How many of the folks in your church’s pews give a great deal of thought to this expectation of our faith?  In what ways might this expectation bring them joy and reassurance rather than fear? Are there also folks in your church who dismiss this idea altogether? If we think of this second coming not as an event but as one part of a process already begun, how are we participating in it?   How might we claim to be in the midst of a process of transforming the world, in the midst of a resurrection set in motion by the raising of Jesus?  How is our work for peace and justice part of that participation? How do the popularized novels about the end of the world differ from your own expectations, and what sort of response do they evoke?  In what ways do they change people’s lives, and in what ways might our lives change if we took this Christian hope more seriously?  Two thousand years later, the thief in the night has not yet arrived, and neither have the labor pains of the woman. Or have they?  Birth, after all, the bringing of new life, is often very long and very hard.  What if the alert level for us children of the day is at its highest level?  How then shall we live?

<!-- BEGIN OT READING -->

<P><B>Judges 4:1-7</B>

<P>The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. So the LORD sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.

<P>At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Go, take position at Mount Tabor, bringing ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun. I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’”

<P><B>Zephaniah 1:7, 12-18</B>

<P>	Be silent before the Lord GOD!
	For the day of the LORD is at hand;
	the LORD has prepared a sacrifice,
	he has consecrated his guests.
	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps,
	and I will punish the people
	who rest complacently on their dregs,
	those who say in their hearts,
	“The LORD will not do good,
	nor will he do harm.”

<P>	Their wealth shall be plundered,
	and their houses laid waste.
	Though they build houses,
	they shall not inhabit them;
	though they plant vineyards,
	they shall not drink wine from them.
	The great day of the LORD is near,
	near and hastening fast;
	the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter,
	the warrior cries aloud there.

<P>	That day will be a day of wrath,
	a day of distress and anguish,
	a day of ruin and devastation,
	a day of darkness and gloom,
	a day of clouds and thick darkness,
	a day of trumpet blast and battle cry
	against the fortified cities
	and against the lofty battlements.

<P>	I will bring such distress upon people
	that they shall walk like the blind;
	because they have sinned against the LORD,
	their blood shall be poured out like dust,
	and their flesh like dung.

<P>	Neither their silver nor their gold
	will be able to save them
	on the day of the LORD’S wrath;
	in the fire of his passion
	the whole earth shall be consumed;
	for a full, a terrible end
	he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.

<P><B>Psalm 90:1-8, (9-11), 12</B>

<P>Refrain:
<BR><B>
From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
</B>

<P>O God, you have been
<BR>our dwelling place
<BR>in all generations.

<P>Before the mountains were brought
<BR>forth, or ever you had formed the earth
<BR>and the world,
<BR>from everlasting to everlasting
<BR>you are God.

<P>You turn us back to dust,
<BR>and say, "Turn back, you mortals."

<P>For a thousand years in your sight are
<BR>like yesterday when it is past,
<BR>or like a watch in the night.

<P>You sweep them away;
<BR>they are like a dream,
<BR>like grass that is renewed in
<BR>the morning

<P>in the morning it flourishes
<BR>and is renewed;
<BR>in the evening it fades and withers.

<P>For we are consumed by your anger;
<BR>by your wrath we are overwhelmed.

<P>You have set our iniquities
<BR>before you,
<BR>our secret sins in the light of
<BR>your countenance.

<P>For all our days pass away
<BR>under your wrath;
<BR>our years come to an end
<BR>like a sigh.

<P>The days of our life are seventy years,
<BR>or perhaps eighty, if we are strong;
<BR>even then their span is only toil
<BR>and trouble;
<BR>they are soon gone,
<BR>and we fly away.

<P>Who considers the power
<BR>of your anger?
<BR>Your wrath is as great as the
<BR>fear that is due you.

<P>So teach us to count our days
<BR>that we may gain a wise heart.

<P><B>1 Thessalonians 5:1-11</B>

<P>Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. When they say, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and there will be no escape! But you, beloved, are not in darkness, for that day to surprise you like a thief; for you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness. 

<P>So then let us not fall asleep as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober; for those who sleep sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him. Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.

<P><B>Matthew 25:14-30</B>

<P>“For it is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. 

<P>After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ 

<P>Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

<P>Thirty-third Sunday in Ordinary Time
<BR>November 13, 2005
<BR>1 Thessalonians 5:1-11

<P>What Do You Expect?

<P>Stewardship is about managing the abundance that God has made ours—and not just “ours,” but everyone’s.  This abundance is no less than life itself, the gift of God in which all share.  How do we understand this gift?  That abundance?  In Christian understanding this is expressed in terms of the coming of Christ—the expectation that in everything we know and face, goodness and mercy are waiting to be born anew and made real again in and for us and others.  This is the light that was in the world but which the world knew not, says John (1:10).  Amid the deepest shadows of evil and suffering, we expect that God’s light shall pierce the gloom, revealing love and justice to which we had been oblivious or “blind.”

<P>Is this what we expect? The quality of our expectations determines the quality of our action.  As we look at what we face, personally and congregationally, what kinds of questions are we asking? Do we fear the worst or expect the best?

<P>The quality of giving hangs in the balance, awaiting our answer to the question.  Do we believe that even amid the hardest and most demanding circumstances, hope and assurance, power and possibility are on the way, waiting to happen again?  Nothing squelches good giving more than misgiving about what we face.  Nothing blocks generosity so well as anxiety about what lies before us.

<P>Gifted by God with the expectation of abundance, we live out this promise in our eagerness to give generously.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
