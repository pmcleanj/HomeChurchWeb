</P>
<P>Rulers in the Near East had long seen themselves as shepherds of
their subjects. Ezekiel was sent by God to prophesy against Israel&rsquo;s
kings, who had misused their people and were responsible for
scattering them. The kings had taken the plenty of the land for
themselves, rather than sharing it with their subjects. Written in a
time of despondency (Judah had been invaded by Babylon in 587 BC),

blame the people&rsquo;s sorry state on the kings: some had dispersed
around the Mediterranean; others were deported to Babylon; those left
at home were no better off. In foreign lands, they have fallen prey
to pagan beliefs. Rulers too are subject to God&rsquo;s law: they are
individually responsible for the mess.</P>
<P>Now God will reverse the evil done by the bad human shepherds. He
will seek out the sheep, and &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>)
them from wherever they have been scattered. God will &ldquo;gather

&ldquo;strayed&rdquo;, &ldquo;injured&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; &ndash;
but he will destroy the &ldquo;fat and the strong&rdquo;, i.e. those
who rule them. God will give them justice: rulers will be accountable
for their actions. God will judge, and differentiate between, the
&ldquo;fat sheep&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A20" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">20</A>,

The sheep must behave properly, and submit to &ldquo;one shepherd&rdquo;

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ephesians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This letter of Paul was written from prison, probably
in Rome. Whilst the Bible states that it was written to the church at
Ephesus, the some early manuscripts do not contain an addressee in
1:1. This would imply that Ephesians was a circular letter, sent to a
number of churches. If so, it introduced a new idea into letter
writing: we know of no other circular letters from this period. This
book celebrates the life of the church, a unique community
established by God through the work of Jesus Christ, who is its head,
and also the head of the whole creation. </FONT>

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Ephesians 1:15-23</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul has written of the Father&rsquo;s wisdom and insight in
making known to us his will, his plan for completion of the
restoration of the faithful to oneness with him, as told by Jesus
(vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8</A>,

God&rsquo;s plan embraces both Jews and Gentiles, bringing them
together in one Christian community. That this is happening he sees
as evidence of God&rsquo;s ability to break down diverse barriers,
and to bring the world to unity in Christ.</P>
<P>And so, in vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A15-16" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15-16</A>,
he is delighted to hear of the successful missionary activity by
people he does not know at first hand. Their &ldquo;faith&rdquo;
(commitment to Christ) and fraternal love (love of &ldquo;all the
saints&rdquo;, Christians both Jewish and Gentile) go hand in hand:
faith involves appreciating God&rsquo;s great love for humanity
demonstrated in the Father&rsquo;s giving of the Son. That &ldquo;your&rdquo;

Paul prays that these (relatively) new converts may receive &ldquo;a
spirit of wisdom and revelation&rdquo; as each progressively come to
understand God more and more. It is not just <EM>digested knowledge</EM>
(&ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;) that they will receive, but also &ldquo;revelation&rdquo;,
what God will show of himself and his ways, his manifest character,
his greatness, &ldquo;glory&rdquo;, and the fruit of interaction of
knowledge with experience. The objective (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A18" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">18</A>)
is that, illuminated by innermost conviction (&ldquo;with the eyes of
your heart&rdquo;), they may attain a maturer knowledge of God in
three ways:

	<LI><P>Paul&rsquo;s experience speaks here: God showed him mercy

	this power that they now experience is what the Father used in
	raising Christ and having him share in the divine glory. Christ has
	also conquered all alien spiritual powers (&ldquo;far above all rule

	and pagan gods (&ldquo;every name that is named&rdquo;). God has
	made &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A22" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">22</A>)
	subject to humanity; the Father has given Christ to the church as
	ruler over all things spiritual. The church is one in Christ and
	thus is able to share in Christ&rsquo;s exaltation, Christ being the
	complete embodiment of God, who is in the process of filling (making
	good) all things. It is through the church that God pervades the
	world with his goodness.</P>

are the Parable of the Talents. Jesus has used it to stress the
importance of fidelity to him and his mission while he is away. Here
Jesus tells us the kind of conduct, of morality, towards others
expected of the faithful &ndash; and the consequences of not caring
for others. Sheep and goats behave differently but in Palestine they
were fed together. At the end of the era, when Christ comes again, he
will act for the Father (&ldquo;sit on ... [his] throne&rdquo;, v.

He will separate the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A32" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">32</A>)
from the &ldquo;goats&rdquo;, assigning the former to a place of
honour (&ldquo;at his right hand&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A33" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">33</A>)
and the latter to dishonour. He, as &ldquo;king&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A34" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">34</A>)
will invite the godly (or faithful), those whom the Father has
pre-ordained for this, to live with him (&ldquo;the kingdom&rdquo;),
a state that existed before creation (&ldquo;from the foundation of
the world&rdquo;). Why? Because the godly have fulfilled God&rsquo;s
expectation: in reaching out to the disadvantaged they have, in fact,
been reaching out to him (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A40" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">40</A>).
We are all part of his family. But the &ldquo;goats&rdquo;, those who
have ignored the needy, will be permanently separated from God, be
unhappy, and be punished, for they have failed to see Christ in
people. The &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A46" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">46</A>)

Jeremiah, he lived through the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians,
the destruction of the temple and the exile of the greater number of
the leading citizens. Included in this exile were the priestly
families, of whom Ezekiel was a member. He did not witness the actual
sack of Jerusalem in 587 BCE because he had already been deported
with King Jehoiachin ten years earlier. Rather, he was a witness from
afar which may well account for the gloomy predictions of judgment
and visions of destruction articulated in his prophecies. In fact,
some modern analysts of Ezekiel's life and ministry have speculated
that he may have suffered from schizophrenia.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">When
Jerusalem finally did fall to the Babylonians in 586 BCE, Ezekiel
experienced a strange reversal of his prophetic insight. In the
latter segment of his work, he expressed a prophetic hope which he
did not have in his earlier pronouncements. Whereas words of doom
against Judah and Jerusalem generally fill the early chapters of the
book (chs. 1-24) and oracles against foreign nations are proclaimed
in chs. 25-32, the concluding segment (chs. 33-48) contains promises
of &quot;the eventual restoration of Yahweh's people and a blueprint
for a reconstruction of the cult.&quot; (Christopher T. Begg in
<I>Oxford Companion to the Bible</I>, 218). Ch. 34 forms an
introduction to this latter segment following the transitional
interlude of ch. 33.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The passage
preceding this reading (34:1-10) speaks of divine judgment of
Israel's spiritual leaders because they abandoned Yahweh's people.
The note of judgment resurfaces in vss. 17-22. In the interim,
Ezekiel promises that Yahweh will become as a shepherd seeking the
his wandering flock, leading them to a suitable pasture and tending
to the wounded and the weak (vss. 11-16).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The reading
ends with two oracles which may not have any relation to each other.
Vss. 20-22 speaks of a separation of the fat and the lean sheep.
These metaphors represent the powerful leaders of the people who have
oppressed and scattered the weak, and now will be judged by Yahweh.
The final oracle envisages the appointment of a new shepherd, a
Davidic prince who will shepherd the people in Yahweh's place. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The
metaphor of Yahweh as the shepherd of Israel is common in the
language of the late prophetic period, especially in Ezekiel and
Deutero-Isaiah. In fact, Ezekiel 34:13-16 can be read as an allegory
of Yahweh's lovingkindness and mercy. Jesus may have seen his
ministry in this light of this passage, and certainly, the apostolic
church recognized him as the promised Messiah. Read John 10:1-18 to
see how much this was so. The Jewish interpretation of the passage
recognizes the promise of a messianic leader of God's people, but
differs as to the identity of Jesus in this role.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="PSALM 100"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>PSALM
100</B> This familiar hymn has been sung joyfully by faithful people
entering places of worship for at least 2500 years. It proclaims the
essential creed of Israel: The Lord is God, the creator of all; we
are God's people; God's goodness and kindness are everlasting; God's
faithfulness endures to all generations.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The psalm
may have been sung as the assembled worshipers processed through the
gates of the temple and into the sacred precincts for a service of
thanksgiving and thank offering. It may have had a liturgical
structure in which vss. 1-3 could have been sung by one choral group
of Levites at the head of the procession as they moved up to the
temple gates; and vss. 4-5 sung by another group bidding the
worshipers to enter. It is believed to have been written for such use
in the post-exilic period. It could still be used very dramatically
in a similar manner. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The most
familiar versions of this psalm are in the metrical forms dating from
the English and Scottish Reformation. During the bloody reign of Mary
Tudor (1553-1558), many English and Scots Protestants fled to Europe.
In Geneva, an English community gathered, translated and revised a
collection of metrical psalms. Many of these exiles returned to
England on the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558, bringing this
collection to be completed and published in England in 1562 as <I>The
Whole Booke of Psalmes</I>. Among these was the familiar version of
Psalm 100, &quot;All people that on earth do dwell.&quot; The psalms
served the unique purpose of engaging the people of the congregations
in worship in much the same way that the prescribed responses of the
Roman Catholic liturgy has done. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">John Knox,
the Scottish Reformer, carried a similar collection of psalms back to
Scotland in 1559. It displaced an earlier collection authorized by
James I. It remained the hymn book of the Scottish Kirk until the
Westminster Assembly of 1643 which sought to bring about conformity
in church government and worship throughout the two kingdoms.
Controversy ensued over which of two improved versions of the
metrical psalms would be preferred. The English and Scottish churches
chose different versions. In 1650, the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland in 1650 appointed one of these &quot;to be sung in
congregations and families.&quot; Included was the familiar Geneva
version of Psalm 100, now slightly altered for the better by a Scot,
William Kethe. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">One of
these variations came about through a typographical error. In vs. 3
&quot;we are his people&quot; read as &quot;we are his folck (folk),
he doth us feed&quot;, but appeared in print as &quot;we are his
flock.&quot; The variation makes such perfect sense that many may
well sing it in this way. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><A NAME="PSALM 95:1-7A"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>PSALM
95:1-7A </B><I>(Alternate)</I> This is one of series of psalms which
may also have been sung by pilgrims as they entered the temple
precincts. This excerpt praises and thanks Yahweh as Creator and
Sovereign of the universe. There is, however, a note of henotheism in
vs. 3 where Yahweh is not only described as a great god, but the king
over all other gods. This represents a theological position that
contrasts Israel&rsquo;s god Yahweh with the gods of other nations,
although elevated above such other gods as the Canaanite Baal, the
Moabite Chemosh and the Ammonite Molech. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Vs. 6
contains an interesting reference to kneeling in prayer. This
indicates that the procession of worshipers praising Yahweh had
already entered the temple where each had reached his appointed
station for worship. The Jews adopted several positions for prayer
including prostration and kneeling. Prostration symbolized obeisance;
kneeling was adopted for petition. The latter succeeded the former
suggesting that one changed positions because there was something to
see. Today, television often shows Jewish worshipers standing before
the Western Wall of the Temple to pray and Moslem worshipers
prostrate at prayer with forehead to the ground, then kneeling. For
Christians, there is no absolutely correct position for prayer. We
may approach God in positions that suit the moment. The important
thing is to be reverent in what we are doing.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Vs. 7
repeats the familiar metaphor of Yahweh as shepherd of Israel found
in other psalms and prophets like Ezekiel. That is why it became a
familiar metaphor for Jesus.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="EPHESIANS 1:15-23"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>EPHESIANS
1:15-23</B> Whether or not Paul was the author of this letter (a
subject of much scholarly debate), it is one of the great treasures
of the New Testament. It may not have begun as a letter at all, but
as a prayer followed by a sermon admonishing the faithful to live a
life worthy of the faith they have espoused in the unity of the
Spirit under the sovereignty of Christ. This is the approach taken by
NT scholar, John C. Kirby, of McGill University, Montreal, in his
compelling analysis of the letter, <I>Ephesians, Baptism and
Pentecost</I> (McGill University Press, 1968). </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The opening
three chapters follow the pattern of a typical Jewish liturgical
prayer known as a <I>berakah</I>. Not only does it exhibit poetic
characteristics, its tone of wonder and solemnity evoke a mood of
contemplative worship with the repeated phrase &quot;to the praise of
his glory.&quot; Though thoroughly Christian in character, this type
of blessing recalls the prayers of Jewish worship in the synagogues
out of which many of the early Ephesian Christians came. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">This
excerpt, on the other hand, includes certain elements which were
typical of Paul's letters. In vss. 15-16, for instance, he recalls
the faith and the love of the Ephesians and gives thanks for them as
he prays for them. He then returns to his earlier theme of what God
has done through the resurrection of Jesus Christ: the dead have been
made alive and the alienated have been reconciled.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">We may
conclude that Paul was speaking of a spiritual experience. There is
an intellectual component to it as well. He prayed that God would
give them &quot;a spirit of wisdom and revelation&quot; as they come
to know Christ (vs. 17). The following unusual phrase, &quot;with the
eyes of your heart enlightened,&quot; (vs. 18) ties together both
knowledge of truth and the revelation which only faith can perceive.
That Paul intended knowledge to be an integral part of faith is
reiterated in the several soaring clauses of vss. 18-21. They are &quot;to
know&quot; the hope to which they are called, the riches of their
inheritance among the saints, and the working of God's power derived
from Christ's resurrection and ascension to the place of total
sovereignty.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Is it
possible that the end of all this will be that not only Jesus Christ
reigns over all things (vs. 22), but that because Christ is the head
of his Body, the church also shares his sovereignty? If so, does this
not reaffirm the triumphalist concept of Christendom? A fairer
interpretation, however, holds that it is Christ, not the church, who
is the sovereign. Neither the ecclesiastic community, in the most
catholic sense of that term, nor one of its ministers, however
selected, has any claim to the absolute embodiment of Christ or his
&quot;vicar&quot; on earth.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">&quot;The
fullness of him who fills all in all&quot; (vs. 23) might be said to
refer to the faith that Christ is &quot;the essential content of the
church&quot;; but to quote F.W. Beare (<I>The Interpreter's Bible</I>,
X 636) it would be better to take the phrase to mean that the
relationship between Christ and the church is complementary, &quot;that
which makes complete. Christ and the church together form an organic
unity.... Clearly, the thought of the church as Christ's fullness is
related to the thought that the whole created universe is tributary
to him and will undoubtedly be gathered to him. In the church the
ultimate cosmic unity is realized in nucleus and in anticipation.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Thus, we
are dealing with an eschatological vision of the church, not as it
existed in Paul's time, or as it has been throughout the past two
millennia, or as it is today. The scandal of our disunity that leads
to prejudice, rivalry, hostility, condemnation and even open warfare
is sufficient evidence of that. Paul's envisions the church as &quot;the
microcosm of what all existence will finally be,&quot; as E. F. Scott
said in his commentary on this passage. (<I>Colossians, Philemon,
Ephesians</I>, 160.)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Let William
Barclay have the last word from <I>The Epistle to the Ephesians</I>
(Daily Bible Readings. Church of Scotland, 1956): &quot;There is a
legend which tells how Jesus went back to heaven after His time on
earth....The angels were talking to him and Gabriel said, &quot;You
must have suffered terribly for men down there.... Do they all know
about how you loved them and what you did for them? .... What have
you done to let everyone know about it?&quot; .... Jesus answered, &quot;I
have asked Peter and James and John and a few others to make it the
business of their lives to tell others about me, and the others still
others, and yet others, until the farthest man on the widest circle
knows</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">about what
I have done.&quot; Gabriel looked very doubtful, for Gabriel knew
well what poor stuff men were made of. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;but
what if (they) fail? What if the people who come after them forget?
What if away in the twentieth century people just don't tell others
about you? Haven't you made any other plans?&quot; And Jesus
answered, &quot;I haven't made any other plans. I am counting on
them.&quot; </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="MATTHEW 25:31-46"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>MATTHEW
25:31-46</B> This parable tells us that the reign of Christ will
begin with a final judgment. But it is a parable, a story told to
persuade people on how to live as they prepare for that inevitable
experience, not a description of what the event will be like. The
story also has an eschatological and a messianic emphasis set in
place by its very first clause, &quot;When the Son of Man comes in
his glory and all his angels with him ....&quot; That is a typical
description from the apocalyptic tradition derived from Jewish
literature of the centuries BCE greatly influenced by forerunners in
both the prophetic and possibly the wisdom traditions. (See Ezekiel
38-39; Isaiah 24-27; Zechariah 12-14.) Its stock-in-trade was
revelation through visionary experience; and this parable contains
some very vivid images of that kind.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">In vss. 31
and 32 there are two images of the judgment which may seem to be
unusually juxtaposed. The first envisages a typical a royal court
where the monarch is surrounded by courtiers and the whole populace
is gathered before the throne waiting for a critical decision. The
second describes the much humbler scene of a shepherd at the end if a
day separating sheep from goats as they enter the fold for the night.
The task was an easy one, for in the Middle East sheep are generally
white and goats black. The monarch's task might not be so easy, for
the character of human beings is much more complex. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The story
does simplify the basis on which the judgment is made. It has to do
with how each person responds to everyday opportunities to help
others in need. The length and detail with which this poignant
emphasis is described assures even the hasty reader that this is what
the story means. The reign of Christ and God's eternal judgment are
going on right now with each decision and action we take. How we live
today has eternal consequences. We are to witness to the reign of
Christ in the way we serve him in faithfulness, kindness and love to
our neighbors in need. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Yet this
parable is not a simple story offering polite moral counsel seeking
for ethical behavior to create a kinder, gentler, self-satisfied
society. Coming as it does immediately before the Passion story, this
parable connects our time in history and the time of Jesus as an
historical person with the reality of eschatological judgment at the
end of time. The way this parable describes how the faithful are to
live is the way Jesus lived &quot;as one that served.&quot; His
actions constantly affirmed his messianic character. Matthew
constantly reminded his audience of this in his choice of names by
which he referred to Jesus of Nazareth, in this instance the OT
messianic figure of the Son of Man. As he turned to the all important
conclusion of his gospel, Matthew was saying that in Jesus the
Messiah the divine judgment which Israel has anticipated for so long
had arrived. The gospel speaks across the millennia with the same
clarion call of judgment: the crucified and risen Jesus, the ever
present 'God with us,' is now deciding who will have a part in the
eternal reign of love fulfilled in God's creation.</FONT></P>

for a fixation on the parable of the &ldquo;Dry Bones&rdquo; (Ezek.
37), Protestant Christianity has almost ignored the remainder of the
book of Ezekiel, probably because of its apparently outlandish
imagery and symbolism.&nbsp; But it ignores Ezekiel to its own hurt.&nbsp;
In prophecy after prophecy, Ezekiel probably represents the most
penetrating and nuanced social analysis that appears anywhere in
scripture.&nbsp; Such is true of the Old Testament lesson for today&rsquo;s
lectionary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;The word of the Lord came to me: Mortal,
prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them,
Thus says the Lord God: Ah you shepherds of Israel who have been
feeding yourselves!&nbsp; Should not shepherds feed the sheep&rdquo;
(Ezek. 34:1-2)?&nbsp; The metaphor of Israel as &ldquo;sheep&rdquo;
and Israel&rsquo;s political, economic and religious leaders as
&ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; is a metaphor used throughout scripture
(e.g., Num. 27:16-17; I Kings 22:17).&nbsp; Ezek. 34:1-10 is an
indictment brought against Israel&rsquo;s aristocracy for using their
power, wealth and influence to oppress, exploit and control the
people rather than caring for and nurturing them.&nbsp; The systems
of Israel have used their position and power for their own benefit,
and not for the good of the people.&nbsp; To the contrary, they have
used that power to exploit the people and to take advantage of them
at every turn.&nbsp; Thus God brings judgment upon Israel&rsquo;s
kings, religious leaders and the wealthy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus says the
Lord God, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at
their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep.&nbsp; I will
rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for
them&rdquo; (vs. 10).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But God will do more than hold the systems
accountable for their victimization of the people.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will
seek them out.&nbsp; I will rescue them from all the places to which
they have been scattered.&nbsp; I will bring them out from the
peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into
their own land.&nbsp; I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the
strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the
weak.&nbsp; I will feed with justice&rdquo; (excerpted from vss.
11-16).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Yahweh will search out the scattered sheep (it is
intriguing to note the words used by Ezekiel for God&rsquo;s actions
toward a wasted Israel:&nbsp; &ldquo;searching&rdquo;, &ldquo;rescuing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;gathering&rdquo;, &ldquo;feeding&rdquo;, &ldquo;healing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;nurturing&rdquo;).&nbsp; Yahweh will restore public justice
(vss. 11-16).&nbsp; He will do so by punishing the ruling class for
taking advantage of, brutalizing and scattering the flock (vss.
17-22).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But God will do more than that.&nbsp; In one of
Ezekiel&rsquo;s most brilliant analyses, he states that God will also
sort out from Israel the &ldquo;rams and male goats&rdquo; who have
&ldquo;pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak
animals with your horns&rdquo; (vs. 21).&nbsp; In other words, it is
not simply the rich, the powerful and the priestly who have taken
advantage of the people.&nbsp; The people have taken advantage of
each other. &ldquo;We have met the enemy and he is <I>us</I>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a reprise of 22:29-30, Ezekiel notes that people who were just a
little higher on the economic, social or religious scale but were not
among the elite had imitated the elite, and had themselves taken
advantage of those weaker than themselves.&nbsp; Even &ldquo;animals&rdquo;
within the &ldquo;herd&rdquo; had started &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;
others below them, so that middle classes were bullying lower
classes.&nbsp; That was how insidiously the evil of the &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo;
had entered all of public life, in that it had gotten the people to
turn against each other as they aped the values the power elite were
practicing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What will be the initiative that God will take on
behalf of victim Israel that has turned them into scattered sheep?&nbsp;
Verses 23-31 lay out that initiative.&nbsp; A Davidic figure will
emerge who will be both servant and prince, and who will bring about
the liberation of the people (see 37:24-28; Jer. 23:5; 30:8-10;
33:17-26; Isa. 9:6-7; Hos. 3:5; Amos 9:11; II Sam. 7:8; I Kings
11:34).&nbsp; Israel&rsquo;s transformation will occur through God&rsquo;s
intervention and God&rsquo;s intervention alone &ndash; not through
their own revolutionary activity.&nbsp; And that transformation will
happen through the life, ministry, work and intervention of God&rsquo;s
servant, &ldquo;David&rdquo; (vss. 23-24).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The result of &ldquo;David&rsquo;s&rdquo;
intervention will be the creation of a new kingdom &ndash; the
kingdom of God &ndash; the kingdom of shalom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
make with them a covenant of shalom.&nbsp; I will send down the
showers in their seasons; they shall be showers of blessing.&nbsp;
They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I am the
Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the
hands of those who enslaved them.&nbsp; They shall live in safety,
and no one shall make them afraid.&nbsp; They shall know that I, the
Lord their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are
my people, says the Lord God&rdquo; (vss. 25-31).&nbsp; And all this
will happen because of the intervention and liberation of Yahweh&rsquo;s
servant, the coming princely David.&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Matthew 25:31-46</B></U> is, in my opinion,
the most important parable in the Gospel of Matthew, comparable to
the parables of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son in the Gospel
of Luke.&nbsp; We can make that judgment both because of its position
in Matthew&rsquo;s story and because of the way this parable
summarizes Jesus&rsquo; entire message in that Gospel.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In position, this parable is the final parable (and
therefore the climax) in the pericope of parables on &ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo;
(24:45-25:46).&nbsp; It is the final parable of all the parable
pericopes throughout the Gospel of Matthew.&nbsp; And finally and
most importantly, it is the final parable spoken by Jesus in the
entire Gospel account.&nbsp; Following the Hebrew principle of the
last in order being the first in importance, this parable becomes the
interpretive parable <I>par excellence</I> of the Gospel of Matthew.&nbsp;
This is the final teaching that Jesus wants imprinted on the minds,
hearts and in the consciousness of his listeners, the apex teaching
he doesn&rsquo;t want them ever to forget! This parable is the
teaching that, above all, Jesus wants every believer to take to his
heart and every church never to forget!&nbsp; This is the Gospel of
Matthew summarized, even personified!&nbsp; What is the teaching with
which Jesus wants to leave us?&nbsp; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his
glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of
his glory.&nbsp; All the nations will be gathered before him, and he
will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the
sheep from the goats.&nbsp; And he will put the sheep at his right
hand and the goats at the left.&nbsp; Then the king will say to those
at his right hand, &ldquo;Come, you that are blessed by my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you
gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I
was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of
me, I was in prison and you visited me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the
righteous will answer him, &lsquo;Lord, when was it that we saw you
hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to
drink?&nbsp; And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed
you, or naked and gave you clothing?&nbsp; And when was it that we
saw you sick or in prison and visited you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the king
will answer them, &lsquo;Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one
of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to
me&rsquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; (vss. 34-40).&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Then follows an equally lyrical passage of almost
identical construction concerning the goats who must come for
judgment, for &ldquo;you did not do it to one of the least of these,
(and therefore) you did not do it to me&rdquo; (vs. 45).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The parable begins with a clear definition of
roles.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all
the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.&nbsp;
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate
people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats&rdquo; (vss. 31-32).&nbsp; The &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; (vs.
31) is also referred to in this parable as the &ldquo;king&rdquo;
(vs. 34) and the &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; (vs. 37).&nbsp; Indisputably,
this is Jesus because the &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; is the term he
uses of himself throughout the Gospel of Matthew (in fact, 28 times),
so it is intriguing that he uses as synonyms for himself the titles
of &ldquo;king&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
nations&rdquo; (vs. 32) is meant to refer to the whole inhabited
world that is gathered for judgment by the new &ldquo;David&rdquo;
(Isa. 2:1, 4; 66:18, Joel 3).&nbsp; Picking up on Ezekiel&rsquo;s use
of the word, &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; are meant to refer to God&rsquo;s
chosen people (e.g, Ps. 100; Matt. 9:36; 10:16).&nbsp; &ldquo;Goats&rdquo;
are those to be rejected, their judgment being eternal separation
from God (13:12, 24-30, 47-50).</P>
<P>What is most significant about this parable, however, is not the
roles played by specific characters (although it helps us to
understand the parable better by identifying the players of the
roles).&nbsp; What is most significant about this parable is its
profoundly clear and even lyrical statement about what God expects
out of God&rsquo;s people!</P>
<P>There are three primary ways of interpreting this parable.&nbsp;
All of these interpretations are legitimate.&nbsp; Each
interpretation nuances the parable in a way that, all considered
together, creates a world-enveloping message.&nbsp; And each &ndash;
and then all, considered together &ndash; enables us to understand
what Jesus expects out of God&rsquo;s people, wherever they may be in
the world and however they might manifest themselves.</P>
<P>The first interpretation is an internal insight.&nbsp; That is, a
particular community of God&rsquo;s people is ultimately judged by
their actions toward those in their midst who are most hurting.&nbsp;
The phrase from the parable that enables this interpretation to occur
is the key phrase, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one
of the least of these <I>who are members of my family</I>, you did it
to me&rdquo; (vs. 40, and conversely, vs. 45).&nbsp; The attention
for this interpretation is centered on Jesus&rsquo; words, &ldquo;who
are members of my family&rdquo; (a better translation is &ldquo;my
brothers [and sisters&rdquo;, implied]).&nbsp; That is, what Jesus
was saying was that the true integrity of God&rsquo;s people is found
in how they treat &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo; brother and
sisters who are also part of that same community.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>&ldquo;The least of these&rdquo; was the popular term in Israel
used for &ldquo;the expendables&rdquo; &ndash; those people who were
at the economic bottom of Jewish culture and had been ostracized from
Israelite life as unclean.&nbsp; These were the lepers, the beggars,
the orphans and widows, the shepherds, the impoverished who were no
longer able to compete for even scraps in the Israelite economy.&nbsp;
Such people were not only economically rejected; they were
religiously shunned (&ldquo;unclean&rdquo;) and politically
unrepresented.&nbsp; No decent Jew &ndash; whether he was a wealthy
nobleman, a priest or even a peasant, would have anything to do with
such people.&nbsp; And here Jesus is saying that the way to
understand whether a particular manifestation of the people of God
(i.e., a given synagogue) is truly a part of God&rsquo;s people is to
ask how they treat the expendables in their village (since there was
only one synagogue for every village).&nbsp; This was Jesus&rsquo;
definition of authentic faith (see Micah 6:8).</P>
<P>The second interpretation concentrates upon the same statement,
but it changes somewhat its focus.&nbsp; Rather than concentrating
upon &ldquo;the least of these <I>brothers and sisters of mine</I>&rdquo;,
as does the first interpretation, the second places its emphasis upon
<I>the least of these</I>&rdquo;.&nbsp; This interpretation
recognizes an inherent limitation in the first interpretation, and
seeks to correct it.&nbsp; The danger of the first interpretation is
that, while true, it can lead to parochialism.&nbsp; That is, one
could read this parable in a way that would allow it to declare that
the mark of the authentic congregation was whether it cared for &ldquo;the
expendables&rdquo; in its synagogue.&nbsp; But Jesus wasn&rsquo;t
thinking in terms of simply the expendables who are faithful
participants in the life of a congregation.&nbsp; It is not
suggesting that the only hurting people the church should care about
are the hurting people who are members of that church (as I have
heard some advocate).&nbsp; By definition, the village synagogue was
the synagogue for all the people &ndash; not just those faithful in
their attendance and participation.&nbsp; Therefore, they should be
concerned for all the expendables who might move through the life of
their village &ndash; residents of the village who have fallen on
hard times, itinerating beggars who might come from another village
or area, even Gentiles who might be hurting.&nbsp; The final test of
the authenticity of the people of God is their action toward all the
expendables in the world &ndash; both near and far.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s
people exist for &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo; &ndash; and for no
other purpose.&nbsp; If a people are truly to be honoring to God,
then they will not worship God by keeping all the minutia of the Law
(as did the Pharisees), or observe all the proper liturgies and
rituals of worship (as did the priests and Sadducees).&nbsp; Rather,
the authentic worship of God will be the service of humanity.&nbsp;
And that portion of humanity upon whom the authentic people of God
should be centered are the expendables of that society &ndash; the
poor, the powerless, the marginalized, the rejected, the abandoned.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s truly authentic people are those who give their lives
away in working for the transformation of the plight of the poor and
the empowerment of the poor.</P>
<P>But there is a third way of interpreting this parable.&nbsp; This
is the most powerful &ndash; and even mind-boggling &ndash;
interpretation.&nbsp; And this is the interpretation that most
conforms and confirms the primary emphasis that moves throughout the
entirety of the Gospel of Matthew. &nbsp;This interpretation centers
upon the judgment given upon those identified as &ldquo;sheep&rdquo;
and &ldquo;goats&rdquo;.</P>
<P>Who are the sheep and goats?&nbsp; Our automatic assumption is
that it is people.&nbsp; But take a more careful look at the text.&nbsp;
It begins, &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, then he
will sit on the throne of his glory.&nbsp; And all the <I><B>nations
</B></I>will be gathered before him, and he will separate <I><B>them</B></I>
one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&rdquo;
(vss. 31-32).</P>
<P>The New Revised Standard Version of the Bible does injustice to
this passage by translating it, &ldquo;and he will separate people
one from another&rdquo;.&nbsp; That makes it sound like only
individuals are being judged at this last judgment.&nbsp; But that is
to miss the whole point of what Jesus was seeking to say.&nbsp; Even
a translation of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; would have been better than
&ldquo;people&rdquo;.&nbsp; The preferred English translation, in
almost every other instance is &ldquo;he will separate <I><B>them</B></I>&rdquo;
(meaning &ldquo;the nations&rdquo;). Only this translation makes
clear the point that Jesus is making here.</P>
<P>All will be judged!&nbsp; All individuals, all churches, all
mosques, all synagogues, all temples, all villages and cities, all
economies, all nations &ndash; everything and everyone will
ultimately be judged by God!&nbsp; And this includes Christians as
well as non-Christians, Jews as well as non-Jews.&nbsp; The Greek
words used here, <I>panta ta ethne</I> (&ldquo;all the nations&rdquo;)
can be translated no other way.&nbsp; Absolutely everybody and
everything will someday be judged by God.<!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><A HREF="http://www.piut.org/ordinarytime28A2008.htm#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>[1]<!--[endif]--></FONT></FONT></A>&nbsp;
And how will they be judged?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Every nation will be judged by God as to how it treats its poor!&nbsp;
The military might of a nation means nothing to God.&nbsp; The
economic prowess of a nation is given to it by God only to
assertively seek the removal of its people&rsquo;s poverty and the
poverty of the world.&nbsp; God doesn&rsquo;t bless the nation whose
politicians most talk about God or their religious faith.&nbsp; God
could care less whether that nation and its politicians conform to
that nation&rsquo;s Constitution!&nbsp; The only real question put to
<I><B>every</B></I> nation is &ldquo;What have you done with your
poor?&rdquo;&nbsp; The only sign of a nation&rsquo;s faithfulness and
obedience to God is how intentionally they have organized their life
together to eliminate poverty and to rid their nation of racism,
sexism and marginalization of any peoples.&nbsp; The true
spirituality of a nation is revealed, not by how much their leaders
declare &ldquo;Lord, Lord&rdquo;, but what the disparity of that
nation is between their richest citizens and their poorest peoples.&nbsp;
For there is no place in God&rsquo;s world for any nation that has
not freed all its people from being expendable.&nbsp; That is each
nation&rsquo;s single responsibility and reason for its existence.&nbsp;
And if it has not accomplished the elimination of poverty and the
unequal treatment of its citizens, then it must be judged by God and
be cast &ldquo;into eternal punishment&rdquo;.&nbsp; That is why all
nations ultimately crumble.&nbsp;</P>
<P>And what is true of nations is true of any group within that
nation &ndash; whether Christian or not.&nbsp; Every unit of
government, every city and village, every business and industry,
every club, school or religious institution and &ndash; ultimately &ndash;
every individual is measured by the same criteria.&nbsp; What have
you done with &ldquo;the least of these, your brothers and sisters&rdquo;?&nbsp;
That is the great judgment God brings upon all the &ldquo;peoples&rdquo;
of the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But what about Christians?&nbsp; Are not Christians
&ldquo;saved by faith&rdquo;, not needing good works in order to be
saved?&nbsp; What Jesus&rsquo; final teaching in Matthew seeks to
impress upon us is that, whether one&rsquo;s nation is found among
the righteous sheep or the judged goats, whether one&rsquo;s church
is found among the sheep or the goats, whether one&rsquo;s self is
found among the righteous or the judged depends upon how each has
treated Jesus &ldquo;in the distressing disguise of the poor&rdquo;
(to quote Mother Theresa).&nbsp; One receives Christ by faith.&nbsp;
But the way you can discern whether one is truly a &ldquo;Christ-one&rdquo;
is whether he acts like a &ldquo;Christ-one&rdquo;.&nbsp; It is
through one&rsquo;s deeds of mercy, compassion and concrete working
for justice that one&rsquo;s response to Christ as savior and Lord is
manifested.&nbsp; The righteous sheep participate in the establishing
of God&rsquo;s kingdom by working for that alternative kingdom,
seeking the political, economic, social and spiritual transformation
of society.&nbsp; Their actions manifest God&rsquo;s kingdom in a
sinful world (Isa. 58:6-7).&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The entire theme of the book of Matthew is that
Jesus is the Messiah, the &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo; of Ezekiel 34.&nbsp;
But because of the commitment of Israel&rsquo;s leadership to greed,
control and the lust for power, Jesus is presented by Matthew as the
<I>marginalized</I> Messiah.&nbsp; Jesus is one of &ldquo;the
expendables&rdquo;!&nbsp; In fact, Jesus is the archetype of the
expendables of the world.&nbsp; And as the one who is &ldquo;The
Expendable&rdquo;, the one who has been marginalized by Israel&rsquo;s
and Rome&rsquo;s political, economic and religious elite, Jesus
identifies with the poor, the marginalized, the vulnerable and the
desperate.&nbsp; Therefore, Jesus calls his followers to the very
same living out of the gospel.&nbsp; Jesus&rsquo; disciples are to
live lives of working for justice, for empowerment of the people and
of service among the marginalized nobodies of the world, working
against the &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; (Ez. 34:1-7) and their systems
and for the poor and powerless.&nbsp; That is what it means to be an
authentic follower of Christ.&nbsp; That is the follower who will be
rewarded in the final judgment.&nbsp; And that is true because the
authentic disciple keeps on ministering to the &ldquo;expendable&rdquo;
Jesus &ldquo;in the distressing disguise of the poor&rdquo;!&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Ephesians 1:15-23</B></U><B> </B>is one of the
most profound testimonies to &ldquo;Christ the King&rdquo; in
scripture.&nbsp; Ezekiel describes the Messiah or Christ as a Davidic
monarch who empowers his exploited sheep.&nbsp; Jesus describes the
sheep as the church itself, seeking to imitate Jesus in bringing
liberation and transformation to the poor, marginalized and
disadvantaged of the world.&nbsp; Both passages decry the &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo;
for their commitment to building their own power, wealth and
domination that result in the oppression, exploitation and control of
the people.&nbsp; Now, in Ephesians 1:15-23, the lectionary reaches
its clearest statement of Christ as the liberating king.&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In the earlier part of chapter one of Ephesians,
Paul has described Christians as being blessed (1:3), chosen (vs. 4),
adopted (vs. 5), redeemed and forgiven (vs. 7), aware of God&rsquo;s
call upon their lives (vs. 9), and marked with the Holy Spirit (vs.
13).&nbsp; But for what purpose are Christians so chosen, called and
redeemed by Christ?&nbsp; Given who they are and have been chosen to
be in Christ, Paul tells the Christians that he prays that &ldquo;the
eyes of your heart (be) enlightened, so that you may know what is the
hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious
inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable power for
us who believe&rdquo; (vss. 18-19).&nbsp; In other words, Paul is
praying that the Christians will perceive how power is actually
distributed in the world by God: (rather than to believe the &ldquo;lies&rdquo;
that have been told them by Rome and the Jewish elite), so that they
will join with Christ in the transformation of the world.&nbsp; They
are to understand God&rsquo;s power given to them so that they will
use that power in the cause of Christ and Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom.&nbsp;
But to do so, they must first understand who Christ actually is.&nbsp;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;God put this power to work in Christ when he
raised him from the dead and seated him at the right hand in the
heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and
dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age
but also in the age to come.&nbsp; And he has put all things under
his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church,
which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all&rdquo;
(1:20-23).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To understand what Paul is writing about Jesus here,
one must understand the cosmology under which the ancient world
(including Paul) operated.&nbsp; They believed that the spirit world
and the physical world were closely intertwined, with activities and
actions occurring in the spirit world inevitably impacting what
happened in the physical world &ndash; and vice versa.&nbsp;
Therefore, when Paul would speak of &ldquo;rule and authority and
power and dominion&rdquo;, he meant at one and the same time, both
the angelic/demonic and their physical manifestation in the
political, economic and religious structures of society.&nbsp; Thus,
Paul was describing <I>simultaneously </I>the systems of both heaven
(or hell) and earth when he wrote of:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I><B>Rule</B></I> (or &ldquo;throne&rdquo;) &ndash;
the symbolic institution of power in a state, city, economic or
religious institution, whether in heaven, hell or earth;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I><B>Authority </B></I>&ndash; the specific person
who currently maintains that rule or occupies that &ldquo;throne&rdquo;
(princes can change; thrones and ruling continue);</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I><B>Power </B></I>&ndash; the sanctions or rules
that legitimize the ruler&rsquo;s or throne&rsquo;s rule and
authority over that dominion and the ruler&rsquo;s rights, privileges
and limitations in maintaining that rule and occupying that throne;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I><B>Dominion </B></I>&ndash; the sphere of
influence or territory ruled by that throne (thus, Caesar&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dominion&rdquo; was the Roman Empire; the Jewish high priest&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dominion&rdquo; was wherever the Jewish religion was
followed).</P>
<P>Thus, when one asks, &ldquo;What did Paul have in mind when he
referred to &lsquo;rule, authority, power and dominion&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Was he describing a spiritual warfare between God and the forces of
Satan, or was he describing the struggle between political, economic
and religious systems within a nation or between nations here on
earth?&rdquo;, the correct answer was that he meant both
simultaneously.&nbsp; He was describing both at one and the same
time.&nbsp; Paul, like every other person in the ancient world,
believed that every political, economic or religious struggle here on
earth was a manifestation of a struggle over control of the world
between the forces of God and the forces of Satan.&nbsp; And every
spiritual struggle &ldquo;in the heavenlies&rdquo; was manifested in
struggle here on earth.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Why are we taking the time here to explore the
ancient world&rsquo;s cosmology?&nbsp; Simply because to do so helps
us to understand the profound insight Paul is presenting in today&rsquo;s
Epistle lectionary on &ldquo;Christ the King&rdquo;, an insight that
directly impacts the Gospel and Old Testament lectionaries, as well.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul actually says three things here.&nbsp; First,
he declares that God &ldquo;raised (Jesus) from the dead and seated
him at (God&rsquo;s) right hand in the heavenly places, far above all
rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that
is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come&rdquo;
(1:20-21).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Let&rsquo;s unpack this extremely dense statement.&nbsp;
He tells us that God raised Jesus from the dead.&nbsp; By doing so,
what Paul is arguing is that Christ&rsquo;s power over the systems
began with that initial act that signaled God&rsquo;s power over the
systems and God&rsquo;s capability to set history.&nbsp; Rome and the
Jewish clerical elite could put Jesus to death &ndash; <I>but they
couldn&rsquo;t keep him dead!&nbsp; </I>God would set aside the
physical laws of death and raise Christ from the dead.&nbsp; Thus,
God can do with the systems whatever God chooses to do.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then goes on to declare, &ldquo;and seated
(Christ) at his right hand in the heavenly places&rdquo;.&nbsp; Here,
Paul is declaring that Christ&rsquo;s ascension into heaven was the
indication that God had now made Jesus the monarch of heaven.&nbsp;
This is a rather common theme in the New Testament, taught not only
by Paul, but by Peter, John and the author of Hebrews as well (Rom.
8:34; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3-4; 10:12-13; 12:2; I Pet. 3:21-22; Rev. 1:
17&mdash;2:1).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In this passage, the statement, &ldquo;seated at his
right hand&rdquo; is particularly significant.&nbsp; To be seated at
the right hand of a monarch was not simply the highest place of
honor.&nbsp; It was the seat that only the heir apparent to the crown
could occupy.&nbsp; It was the seat of the &ldquo;prince&rdquo;, the
vice-regent.&nbsp; Therefore, to say that Jesus was sitting at the
right hand of God was to say to people at that time, &ldquo;Jesus is
God&rsquo;s selected ruler of heaven &ndash; right now!&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The passage continues, &ldquo;far above all rule and
authority and power and dominion&rdquo;.&nbsp; What Paul is declaring
here is that Jesus, as monarch of heaven, now rules not only over
heaven but over every political, economic and religious system on
earth (since all ancient peoples believed in the indissoluble
relationship between all things spiritual and all things physical).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then concludes this sentence, &ldquo;above
every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to
come&rdquo;.&nbsp; In Hebrew culture, the name described the essence
of the person, organization or nation.&nbsp; The name &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;
meant &ldquo;God saves&rdquo;.&nbsp; So when Paul states that &ldquo;God
saves&rdquo; is seated on the throne of heaven, heir apparent to that
throne, and is there for now and for all eternity, he is saying that
this Jesus is now monarch of both heaven and of all the nations of
the world for eternity.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Second, Paul then writes, &ldquo;And he has put all
things under his feet&rdquo; (vs. 22a).&nbsp; A meaningless
expression for us today, this was a highly volatile statement in
first-century Rome.&nbsp; The term, &ldquo;he has put all things
under his feet&rdquo; could mean only one thing to anyone living in
the Roman Empire.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has put him under his feet&rdquo;
was a Roman expression used of the Caesar&rsquo;s act of domination
over a defeated monarch.&nbsp; Literally, Caesar placed his foot on
the prone defeated monarch&rsquo;s neck, making him swear fealty to
Caesar and to Rome.&nbsp; Thus, Paul, in using this term, is
declaring that the true emperor of Rome is Jesus who has placed the
&ldquo;false Caesar&rdquo; &ndash; the Roman emperor &ldquo;under his
feet&rdquo; in subjugation.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Third, Paul concludes &ldquo;And God has made Christ
the head over all things for the church which is his body, the
fullness of him who fills all in all&rdquo; (vss. 22b-23).&nbsp; Up
until this point, Paul has been talking about Jesus&rsquo; monarchy
or rule both over heaven and all political and economic systems on
earth.&nbsp; But now he takes it a step further to include the
religious system &ndash; that which gives purpose, direction and
meaning to human society.&nbsp; What does Paul say about Christ&rsquo;s
lordship over religion?&nbsp; He states that Christ has also been
made head of the church (thus the religious system).&nbsp; As
Christ&rsquo;s body, then, the church is to carry out Christ&rsquo;s
claims upon all the world&rsquo;s systems.&nbsp; We are thus to move
into society to work to bring to reality what has already been
accomplished in heaven.&nbsp; For that to occur is to bring about
&ldquo;the fullness of him who fills all in all&rdquo;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What Paul has written here in Ephesians 1:20-23 is
an extremely political statement!&nbsp; Keeping in mind the cosmology
to which Paul and all other Jews and Gentiles held &ndash; that earth
and heaven are so linked that an action in heaven would occur before
it occurred on earth but which would inevitably, relentlessly happen
on earth &ndash; what Paul is saying is that <I>Christ has already
been crowned monarch over all nations, economic orders, religions and
civilizations that do now or will eventually exist!&nbsp; </I>In
other words, Paul is here declaring that <I><B>Jesus is the true
Caesar of the world</B></I>, and the one who claims to be Caesar &ndash;
in this case, Nero &ndash; is an imposter!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This, of course, is an extremely radical concept
that Paul is espousing here &ndash; in fact, the kind of conviction
that would be considered treason by Rome and consequently worthy of
death!&nbsp; From Rome&rsquo;s perspective, this is extremely
revolutionary talk that strikes at the heart of the very legitimacy
of the Roman Empire.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is very important to understand how radical
Christianity was in its first century.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t more
liberal than other philosophies.&nbsp; Nor was it simply
revolutionary.&nbsp; It was extremely radical &ndash; and this
statement by Paul illustrates how radical it actually was.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The difference between being liberal and being
radical is important.&nbsp; Being liberal means being open-minded or
generous, especially toward those who are not as economically or
politically fortunate as you are.&nbsp; Liberalism assumes that the
liberals are holding the primary power, but because they are so
open-minded and generous, they are willing to share some of the
benefits of that power.&nbsp; The premise of liberalism, however, is
that the primary power remains in the hands of those choosing to
share it and only enough benefits are shared to better the living
standards of the lower class while not sacrificing any of the power
of those who wield that power.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The difference between being revolutionary and being
radical is equally important.&nbsp; Being revolutionary and being
liberal are the exact opposite of each other.&nbsp; Liberals hold
onto their power but in their largess choose to share some of its
benefits while not surrendering any of the power.&nbsp;
Revolutionaries consist of the powerless that build sufficient
political or military power that they are successful in overthrowing
the liberals.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Because revolutionaries overthrow the established
order, they are often seen as being radical.&nbsp; But, in reality,
they are reactionary.&nbsp; The reason why is that power is perceived
in the same way by both liberals and by revolutionaries.&nbsp; Power
is perceived as the exercising of might &ndash; whether that is
military might, political might or economic might.&nbsp; And its
operating premise is &ldquo;might makes right&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Therefore, the oppressed, rising up to overthrow the oppressor,
always become the new oppressors.&nbsp; That is why revolution is not
a radical response, but a reactionary response.&nbsp; And that is why
revolution is always bound to fail.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>First century Christianity was neither liberal
(i.e., compassionate) nor revolutionary (i.e., seeking the violent
overthrow of Rome).&nbsp; It was instead, radical (from the Latin
word <I>radix</I>, which means getting to the &ldquo;root&rdquo;).&nbsp;
Neither a generous Caesar who provides &ldquo;bread and circuses&rdquo;
for the people nor a contra-Caesar who seeks to overthrow Caesar and
replace him with a new despotism is the answer.&nbsp; What Paul is
presenting here is a radical response &ndash; a Caesar who is Jesus
who acts out an entirely different kind of power &ndash; relational
power &ndash; power that is built around not being a tyrant but being
a servant (Mark 10:42-45) &ndash; power which has as its purpose
sharing, building mutual power, building reciprocity &ndash; power
that is built upon the relationships one has carefully built with
others that seeks the good of the other as well as one&rsquo;s own
self.&nbsp; That is the radicalism Paul is presenting here when he
declares that Jesus is the authentic Caesar of Rome and of all
nations and peoples.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thus, what is hinted at in Ezekiel 34 and is spelled
out in compassionate action in Matthew 25 is taught as a new
political and theological understanding of power in this passage.&nbsp;
Paul teaches in Ephesians 1:20-23 that Jesus has been crowned by God
as the true Caesar of all the nations, all the political, economic
and religious systems, and all the people of the world (even though
they may not acknowledge his rule).&nbsp; He is ruling them with a
new power &ndash; a relational power &ndash; the power of love.&nbsp;
And because Jesus is the true Caesar of all the earth and of heaven,
then the job of the church is to work as God&rsquo;s hands and feet
in society, seeking to bring about the submission of the systems of
every nation and economy to Christ by actively involving itself in
working for justice in the public arena.&nbsp; <I>That</I> is what
this Sunday &ndash; Christ the King Sunday &ndash; should be about
celebrating!&nbsp;</P>

<P>What does it mean that what we do &quot;to one of the least of
these&quot; we do to Christ (Matthew 25:40)? In 1845, runaway slave
and abolitionist activist Frederick Douglass used today's Gospel to
argue that injustice damages the perpetrator as well as the victim, a
message he hoped would compel his mostly white northern audience to
agitate for the end of slavery for the good of white slaveowners as
well as black slaves, all of whom were brothers and sisters in
Christ. In the process, Douglass shows that when we do justice for
&quot;the least of these,&quot; we do it for the sake of the whole
Body of Christ, for injustice dehumanizes the oppressor and the
passively complicit bystander as well as the oppressed.</P>

</TABLE>In his autobiography, <I>Narrative of the Life of Frederick
Douglass, an American Slave</I>, he tells the story of his Baltimore
slave mistress, Mrs. Sophia Auld, a woman who had earned her own
living until she married and who had never had a slave until young
Frederick came to live in her household. When he first meets her, she
is the Christian ideal and would have been recognized as such by all
of Douglass' readers. She prefers him to look her in the face, a
bodily representation of equality that was a punishable offense in
the slavery South, and she begins to teach him the alphabet until her
husband forbids her to, warning her that teaching a slave to read is
against the law and will only give him ideas that will render him
unfit for the life of unquestioning service before him. Following the
nineteenth-century womanly ideal of submission, she obeys her
husband, and Douglass portrays this move, this first step in treating
him as less than fully human, as the beginning of her descent from
Christianity into hell.
</P>
<P>Douglass explains that Sophia Auld's initial generosity of spirit
is not just confined to the members of her own household, including
her new slave, but is lavished on the larger community and on all
wayfarers. He writes, &quot;When I went there, she was a pious, warm,
and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which
she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the
naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach.&quot;
That is, she obeys Jesus' command, and the Episcopal baptismal
covenant, to seek and serve Christ in all persons. In today's Gospel,
to which Douglass alludes in this passage, Jesus describes a final
judgment in which the litmus test for being sent either to eternal
life or eternal punishment is people's care for others, especially
the poor and marginalized. The Sophia Auld whom Douglass first meets
would have been one of the righteous asking, &quot;Lord, when was it
that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you
something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and
welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we
saw you sick or in prison and visited you?&quot; And, as Jesus
explains, &quot;the king will answer them, `Truly I tell you, just as
you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family,
you did it to me'&quot; (Matthew 25:37-40).</P>
<P>But Sophia Auld's living into Christ's call is short-lived, for
&quot;The fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her
hands, and soon commenced its infernal work.... Slavery soon proved
its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its
influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike
disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness.&quot; Once she
begins the &quot;depravity&quot; of treating young Douglass as &quot;mere
chattel,&quot; as less than a human being, she loses her Christian
charity as well. No longer does she recognize that the hungry, the
naked, and the mourner have a claim on her attention, and her
&quot;angelic face gave place to that of a demon.&quot;</P>
<P>This turn of phrase probably strikes today's readers as overly
melodramatic (although critics at the time praised Douglass for his
&quot;just and temperate tone&quot;), but Douglass did have an
important point to make to his Christian readers. Acts of injustice
do not occur in a vacuum, and even a single decision to treat others
as less than human -- to stop teaching a slave how to read, for
example -- leads slowly but inevitably to other acts of inhumanity.
Before we know it, we have also neglected to clothe and feed the
poor, have ceased to comfort the mourning. It's not for nothing that
Jesus said, &quot;What will it profit them if they gain the whole
world but forfeit their soul?&quot; (Matthew 16:24).</P>

</TABLE>Douglass' conclusion that &quot;Slavery proved as injurious
to her as it did to me&quot; is clearly a rhetorical appeal to his
nineteenth-century white readers, even the abolitionists of whom
often shared their era's racism and who thus might well place a white
woman's suffering above that of a slave. But it is also a warning to
those same readers: If the beginning of Sophia Auld's descent into
hell is to ignore a slave's humanity, and if the proof of this
descent is that she no longer cares for the poor and the mournful,
then where does that leave those who are not slaveowners? What is
their responsibility to the poor, to the mournful, and to the slave
who is demonstrably both? Clearly Douglass's readers were now faced
with a challenge: They could speak out strongly against slavery and
could shelter runaway slaves (in defiance of the Constitution) --
thus living into the mandate of today's Gospel -- or they could join
Sophia Auld as one who will be judged by the Son of Man as &quot;accursed&quot;
and condemned to &quot;the eternal fire prepared for the devil and
his angels&quot; (Matthew 25:41). When Douglass calls abolition &quot;a
sacred cause,&quot; he means that working for freedom is literally
the work of salvation.
</P>
<P>Once slavery ended with the 13th Amendment in 1865, Douglass moved
on to addressing new social injustices: the continuing plight of the
newly freed slaves, and the ongoing problem of gender inequality in
the United States. That is, he recognized that his own salvation
depended on his seeking out the mournful to comfort and the poor to
clothe and to feed. Our dedication to such work is the only question
that the Son of Man will ask when he comes in his glory.</P>
<P>What will our own answer to that question be? Whom are we feeding,
clothing, and comforting? Can we meet Douglass' challenge to us to
live into our Christian calling?</P>
