<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Matthew 25:31-46

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Whatever You Do

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>?Just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.?

<P>Questions:
<BR>For several weeks in the church year, we are hearing many texts about the return of Jesus Christ in glory.  Today?s text from Matthew is perhaps one of the most familiar texts, even though we fall far short of its lesson.  Most people are familiar with Matthew 25 and many feel uneasy about how they will ?measure up? on that day of judgment.  Some scholars suggest that there are more standards for judgment than this one alone and direct readers to other passages, and many agree that the actual ?objects? of compassion and welcome, rather than simply those in need, are the early Christian missionaries sent out by Jesus.  In any case, Thomas Long is most helpful in describing this passage as Jesus? ?parting lesson, the cumulative moment in his teaching ministry,? that ?sums up the major theological themes of Matthew?s Gospel? (Matthew, Westminster Bible Companion).  While he and many other scholars point out that the lesson of this story is found in other cultures and their values, he highlights its ?curious twist,? for the ?sheep? and ?goats? do not seem to know that they encountered ?the Lord of all nations? in their efforts or failures in ministry.  Whether ?the least? in whom we encounter Christ are humble bearers of the gospel (a reminder to all of us about pride in our evangelism) or simply the poorest of the poor, the neediest of the needy, it is clear once again that we are to embody hospitality and compassion...not just our own hospitality and compassion, but the gracious hospitality and tender compassion of God.  That is how we are to be a faithful church.  The United Church of Christ offers the ?extravagant hospitality? that is the still-speaking God?s own hospitality, extended to every single one of God?s precious children, just as Jesus himself welcomed and broke bread with those most on the margins and most excluded from the life of the community.  The justice ministries of United Church of Christ congregations strive to build ?another world? that embodies God?s own vision of healing, justice, and mercy.  In this hour of harvest and abundance, how is your church extending this hospitality, even to those who seem least ?deserving? of it?  How is your church ?imagining? another world in which the needs of ?the least? are met? Who are people to whom you might reach out and, in your own turn, be surprised at what you might learn?  In what ways and in what times have you felt like one of the sheep in this story, or one of the goats?  The story clearly refers to more than just the churches, but all nations.  How do we share this call to compassion, and respond to it, with people of other faiths, or even those ?of no faith??  The Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner spoke of ?anonymous Christians,? who live out the teachings of Christ without claiming to be followers of Christ.  Do you, and the members of your church, believe it is possible to be an ?anonymous Christian??  Matthew?s Gospel arose from an early Christian community and reflects its sense of mission and call as well as its anticipation of God?s judgment and the triumphal return of Jesus, probably sooner than later.  Now that we know it is later, much later, what is our sense of mission and call?  How is the still-speaking God calling us today, in a different time and place, to minister to ?the least of these who are members of my family??

<P><B>Ezekiel 34:11-16, 20-24</B>

<P>For thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. 

<P>I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.

<P>Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.

<P>I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, 

<P>And what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ?Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.? 

<P>Then the righteous will answer him, ?Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you??

<P>Reign of Christ
<BR>November 20, 2005
<BR>Matthew 25:31-46

<P>Thanksgiving

<P>We Americans take pride in our tradition of self-reliance. Yet, during their first winter in Plymouth, our earliest Pilgrim forebears would have perished without outside help. They acknowledged their benefactors the following year when they invited Massasoit and Wampanoag Indians to join them for the first Thanksgiving.
<P>    Bountiful harvests are no longer a matter of doubt among us, the indirect descendants of the Pilgrim pioneers. American farmers produce enough food to provide every man, woman, and child among us with almost four thousand calories a day, whether we want them or not. And even if our country should ever experience an agricultural shortfall, as a nation we have more than enough money to buy all the food we need on the world market.
<P>    But not nearly everyone in the world is as fortunate as we are. Like the Pilgrims, many cannot survive for now without outside help. Thanks to gifts to Our Church=s Wider Mission through One Great Hour of Sharing, we support Foods Resource Bank, an ecumenical Christian response to world hunger, in...
<P>    * Helping families to employ appropriate soil and water conservation technology to grow drought-resistant crops in the semi-arid region of Bamba, in the East African republic of Kenya.
<P>    * Providing access to seeds, forest-friendly family stoves, and small irrigation systems, as well as training in efficient management of rainwater, for 170 rural families in the Madeare region of the Central American nation of Nicaragua.
<P>    *  Supplying seeds and tools to the local church and community service groups that feed the thousands of children, orphaned by the AIDS pandemic, and the grandparents who are their only remaining caregivers, in the southern African nation of Zambia.
<P>    * Assisting displaced families to secure a stable source of income by providing seeds, tools, equipment, and greenhouses to produce food year-around in the Balkan republic of Serbia.
<P>    * Supporting training programs for 120 rural women in three villages in vegetable gardening, fruit tree cultivation, drip irrigation, adult literacy, and health education in the Keur Momar Sarr area of the West African nation of Senegal.
<P>    All of this is made possible because of your contributions to Our Church?s Wider Mission through One Great Hour of Sharing.  On this coming Thanksgiving Day, let us all say a prayer of gratitude to God for the opportunity to return to others the gift of food self-sufficiency which our Pilgrim ancestors received from their neighbors.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
