<h4>Faith Struggle</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>20 Christ has been raised from the dead. What
happened to him shows what will happen to everyone who has died. 21-22
After all, when Adam sinned, the result was death for everyone. But,
when Jesus rose from the dead, everyone was offered new life. 23 So,
this is how the end of the world will happen. First, Christ rose from
the dead. Second, the followers of Christ will rise and will be with
him. Then, the finale will come when he will take everyone's power away
and hands over his Kingdom to God the Father. 25 Christ needs to rule
until the time he completely subdues his enemies. 26 And the last enemy
to be destroyed is death itself!</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>20 But now, Christ has been risen from the dead,
the beginning (point) of those having fallen asleep (in death). 21 For,
since death (is) through a man, also the raising of the dead (is)
through a man. 22 For indeed, everyone died in Adam, so also everyone
will come alive in Christ. 23 (This will happen,) however, each in its
own order: Christ, the beginning (point), then those of Christ, in his
presence, then the finale, 24 when he can give the Kingdom over to God
and Father, when he can do away with all rule and authority and power.
25 For, it is necessary for him to rule as King until which (time) he
can place all enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy destroyed is
death.</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Why do we believe in our own resurrection? Because
we experience the Risen Christ in our midst. As Christ is risen from
the dead, so shall we rise at the End.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Despite the simple logic of faith, many in the
Corinthian church denied the general resurrection. In fact, the young
community was torn apart by in-fighting, cliques, and turf battles. The
instruments of choice for these battles were questions of faith,
especially the nature and scope of the resurrection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two issues added to the controversy. First, Corinth
was a cosmopolitan city on the isthmus that separated upper and lower
Greece. Corinth was a port city that had many visitors spreading many
ideas and philosophies. Early Christian missionaries, like St. Paul,
were some of these foreign visitors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This first challenge dovetailed with the second:
trying to translate the ideas of the Jewish culture into concepts that
made sense in a Greek culture. Time and destiny were concepts that were
definitely different between the two cultures. Jews believed in linear
time; time progressed from a beginning to an end. Greek culture,
however, held that time was cyclical; instead of a straight line, time
turned like a wheel. The seasons of nature were the primary models of
this belief. The progression of time was a mere illusion marked by
humanity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The idea of one's destiny depended upon the concept
of the self. Jews believed in a unity of body and spirit. Greeks,
however, saw the self as primarily spiritual; human existence was the
spirit (i.e., the self) held prisoner in a material body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What was one's ultimate destiny in time? Even
though death meant the separation of the spirit from the body, many
Jews (including Pharisees) believed that God would raise up the bodies
of the righteous and reunite their spirits in a general resurrection.
Many Greeks, however, held that death was a means to true freedom,
since the spirit was completely separated from the confines that
limited material existence (like time).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, imagine preaching the resurrection in a
culture that saw time as a series of interlocking cycles. The idea of
the resurrection would be translated into an analogy (resurrection is
like the coming of spring) or a one time event (like the attainment of
nirvana, a complete breaking away from the cycle and from the world).
The idea of time ending (much less the resurrection of the dead at the
end of time) would seem laughable. Yet, this was Paul's challenge with
the Corinthians.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul argued that Christ's resurrection and the
general resurrection were interlocking realities. If Christ rose, we
will rise. But if we do not rise, then resurrection of Christ was a
fable. And faith was in vain. Notice that these two events forced the
belief in a time concept that had a beginning and an end. No wonder
some of the Gentile Christians at Corinth insisted there was no
resurrection! (See 15:12-19)</p>
<p class="bodytext">This short detour through philosophy may seem
laborious for us today, it was of prime interest to the Greeks that
comprised the faithful a Corinth. Through controversies like these, the
faith of the Church grew in clarity. When we read the problems of the
Corinthians in Scripture, we should grateful that they sought to
understand what they believed. Their challenge in many ways reflects
our struggles today.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Do you struggle believing a doctrine or practice
of the Church? Who do you rely upon to help you understand? How can you
place these troublesome doubts into a greater context? </i></p>
