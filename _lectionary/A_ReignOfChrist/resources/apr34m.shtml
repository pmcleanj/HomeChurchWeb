<b>Ezekiel</b>
</small><p>
<small>Ezekiel was a prophet and a priest. His ministry began before the 
conquest of Judah in 587 BC, and continued in exile in Babylon. This 
book is the foundation for both Jewish and Christian visionary or 
apocalyptic literature, e.g. Revelation (or The Apocalypse.) It is a 
book that contains many strange things (strange because we do not 
understand them, e.g. Ezekiel eating a scroll), but the prophet's 
message to the exiles is clear: he assures his hearers of God's abiding 
presence among them, and he emphasizes God's involvement in the events 
of the day, so that Israel and all nations "will know that I am the Lord". 
For the first time, we see the importance of the individual in his 
relationship to God. To a dispersed and discouraged people, he brings 
a message of hope: hope that God will restore them to their homeland 
and the temple.

<strong>Ezekiel 34:11-16,20-24</strong>
<p>Rulers in the Near East had long seen themselves as shepherds of
their subjects. Ezekiel was sent by God to prophesy against Israel&#8217;s
kings, who had misused their people and were responsible for scattering
them. The kings had taken the plenty of the land for themselves, rather
than sharing it with their subjects. Written in a time of despondency
(Judah had been invaded by Babylon in 587 BC), vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A1-10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-10</a>
blame the people&#8217;s sorry state on the kings: some had dispersed around
the Mediterranean; others were deported to Babylon; those left at home
were no better off. In foreign lands, they have fallen prey to pagan
beliefs. Rulers too are subject to God&#8217;s law: they are individually
responsible for the mess.</p>
<p>Now God will reverse the evil done by the bad human shepherds. He will seek out the sheep, and &#8220;rescue&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>) them from wherever they have 
been scattered. God will &#8220;gather them&#8221; (v.

them, to Palestine; he will care for them (v.

will be accountable for their actions. God will judge, and
differentiate between, the &#8220;fat sheep&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>,
the overfed rich oppressors, the ungodly) and the &#8220;lean&#8221; (the underfed
poor oppressed, the godly). &#8220;I will save my flock, and they shall no
longer be ravaged&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+34%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>). The sheep must behave 
properly, and submit to &#8220;one shepherd&#8221; (v.

of his mission.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<p>All people everywhere (&#8220;all the earth&#8221;) are invited to joyfully worship God. Both the Temple and royal palaces had &#8220;gates&#8221; (v.

<b>Ephesians</b>
</small><p>
<small>This letter of Paul was written from prison, probably in Rome. Whilst 
the Bible states that it was written to the church at Ephesus, the some 
early manuscripts do not contain an addressee in 1:1. This would imply 
that Ephesians was a circular letter, sent to a number of churches. If 
so, it introduced a new idea into letter writing: we know of no other 
circular letters from this period. This book celebrates the life of the 
church, a unique community established by God through the work of Jesus 
Christ, who is its head, and also the head of the whole creation.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Ephesians 1:15-23</strong>
<p>Paul has written of the Father&#8217;s wisdom and insight in making known
to us his will, his plan for completion of the restoration of the
faithful to oneness with him, as told by Jesus (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>).
God&#8217;s plan embraces both Jews and Gentiles, bringing them together in
one Christian community. That this is happening he sees as evidence of
God&#8217;s ability to break down diverse barriers, and to bring the world to
unity in Christ.</p>
<p>And so, in vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A15-16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15-16</a>,
he is delighted to hear of the successful missionary activity by people
he does not know at first hand. Their &#8220;faith&#8221; (commitment to Christ)
and fraternal love (love of &#8220;all the saints&#8221;, Christians both Jewish
and Gentile) go hand in hand: faith involves appreciating God&#8217;s great
love for humanity demonstrated in the Father&#8217;s giving of the Son. That
&#8220;your&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A15" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15</a>) refers to new Christians is 
indicated by &#8220;as you come to know him&#8221; in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>:
Paul prays that these (relatively) new converts may receive &#8220;a spirit
of wisdom and revelation&#8221; as each progressively come to understand God
more and more. It is not just <em>digested knowledge</em>
(&#8220;wisdom&#8221;) that they will receive, but also &#8220;revelation&#8221;, what God will
show of himself and his ways, his manifest character, his greatness,
&#8220;glory&#8221;, and the fruit of interaction of knowledge with experience. The
objective (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>) is that, illuminated by 
innermost conviction (&#8220;with the eyes of your heart&#8221;), they may attain a maturer knowledge of God in three ways: </p>
<ls>
<li>in spiritual growth (&#8220;hope&#8221;) being those whom God has called; </li>
<li>the &#8220;glorious inheritance&#8221; Gentile Christians now share with their Jewish brethren; and </li>
<li>experience of the tremendous power of God as he works in their lives.</li>
</ls>
<p> Paul&#8217;s experience speaks here: God showed him mercy when he was a persecutor of Christians. Then v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>:
this power that they now experience is what the Father used in raising
Christ and having him share in the divine glory. Christ has also
conquered all alien spiritual powers (&#8220;far above all rule ...&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>) and pagan gods (&#8220;every 
name that is named&#8221;). God has made &#8220;all things&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ephesians+1%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>)
subject to humanity; the Father has given Christ to the church as ruler
over all things spiritual. The church is one in Christ and thus is able
to share in Christ&#8217;s exaltation, Christ being the complete embodiment
of God, who is in the process of filling (making good) all things. It
is through the church that God pervades the world with his goodness.</p>

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for <i>Quelle</i>, German for <i>source</i>).
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 60 to 70 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

<strong>Matthew 25:31-46</strong>
<p>Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A14-30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14-30</a>
are the Parable of the Talents. Jesus has used it to stress the
importance of fidelity to him and his mission while he is away. Here
Jesus tells us the kind of conduct, of morality, towards others
expected of the faithful &#8211; and the consequences of not caring for
others. Sheep and goats behave differently but in Palestine they were
fed together. At the end of the era, when Christ comes again, he will
act for the Father (&#8220;sit on ... [his] throne&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>). He will separate the 
&#8220;sheep&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A32" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">32</a>) from 
the &#8220;goats&#8221;, assigning the former to a place of honour (&#8220;at his right hand&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A33" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">33</a>) and the latter to dishonour. 
He, as &#8220;king&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A34" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">34</a>)
will invite the godly (or faithful), those whom the Father has
pre-ordained for this, to live with him (&#8220;the kingdom&#8221;), a state that
existed before creation (&#8220;from the foundation of the world&#8221;). Why?
Because the godly have fulfilled God&#8217;s expectation: in reaching out to
the disadvantaged they have, in fact, been reaching out to him (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A40" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">40</a>).
We are all part of his family. But the &#8220;goats&#8221;, those who have ignored
the needy, will be permanently separated from God, be unhappy, and be
punished, for they have failed to see Christ in people. The &#8220;righteous&#8221;
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+25%3A46" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">46</a>) are the faithful, the godly, 
those who understand that to serve humanity is to serve Christ &#8211; and do so.</p>
