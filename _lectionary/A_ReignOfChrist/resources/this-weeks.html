<h2>&quot;I Just Wanna Be a Sheep</h2>
<p>Two Churches, two different messages.</p>
<p><strong>The first church message</strong><br />
  David Buttrick, Professor of Homiletics and Liturgics Vanderbilt Divinity School, shares this story: A multi-million dollar church was built in an eastern city.  The day of dedication had been set but not all the furnishings had arrived.  The chancel was empty -  no pulpit or altar, no tapestry hanging in the front.  Everyone was upset that the expected furnishings had not arrived.</p>
<p>However, when worshippers gathered for the dedication they found that the walls were not bare.  Someone had snuck into the building the night before and with a wide brush had painted the wall where the tapestry was to hang.  As the worshippers gathered in their new building, they were greeted with these stark words: STOP THE KILLING, FEED THE POOR, LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR. SINCERELY YOURS, JESUS CHRIST.</p>
<p><strong>The second church message</strong><br />
  My secretary attended a mega-church last week at the request of her niece.  This multi-million dollar church was filled with over 1,000 people (for one of its three services).  Men in dark suits and women with perfect coiffed hairdos were in attendance.  Oddly, children were not seen.  Nor were there blue jeans, wheelchairs or scuffed shoes.</p>
<p>After the youth pastor came out and shouted, &ldquo;We are so stinkin&rsquo; blessed!&rdquo; the &ldquo;pastor&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; ran out delivering this message, given in increasing volume and gusto: &ldquo;Give to God and he will show favor to you!  Give to God and he will show favor to you!&rdquo;  GIVE TO GOD AND HE WILL SHOW FAVOR TO YOU!&rdquo;  Amidst clapping, cheering and jumping they handed out the offering plates.</p>
<p>As I reflect on these two messages given in two churches, one by way of graffiti and the other by the church staff, I have to say that the silent message on the bare wall seems more in keeping with Jesus&rsquo; own message.  On this Sunday that we celebrate Christ the King Jesus speaks of justice by way of compassion.</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading (Ezekiel 34: 11-16, 20-24) </h4>
      <p>The beginning of this passage of Ezekiel is comforting.  In Ezekiel&rsquo;s oracle God promises to search for his sheep.  He will rescue his sheep.  He will gather them from all countries.  He will feed them and provide them with clean water.  Verse 16 promises, &ldquo;I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak&hellip;&rdquo;  But then there comes a turn in the scripture.  For the end of verse 16 also promises, &ldquo;But the fat and the strong I will destroy.  I will feed them with justice.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Suddenly judgment comes into the scene &ndash; through the verses that have been omitted from the lectionary reading &ndash; and into verses 20-22.  In this oracle it is promised that the rich, the wealthy, the &ldquo;fat sheep&rdquo; will not get all the fresh water and good grass.  Instead, God will save his &ldquo;lean&rdquo; sheep; they will no longer be ravaged; and God will judge between sheep and sheep.</p>
      <p>How will this happen?  A shepherd will come.  And this shepherd will feed the lean sheep.  And by feeding them and sheltering them and protecting them this servant will be called a prince among them.  He will provide justice with compassion.</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading (Ephesians 1:15-23) </h4>
      <p>Most people are familiar with Mark Twain&rsquo;s book The Prince and the Pauper.  In this story a prince switches places with a commoner who looks very much like he does.  The plot of the story deals with the prince&rsquo;s struggles as a commoner and the commoner&rsquo;s struggles in trying to run the kingdom.  After the boys switch back and the prince becomes the king, this is how the book ends:<br /><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, King Edward VI lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them worthily. More than once, when some great dignitary, some &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gilded vassal of the crown, made argument against his leniency, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and urged that some law which he was bent upon amending was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gentle enough for its purpose, and wrought no suffering or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oppression which any one need mightily mind, the young king &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate eyes upon him and answered: <br /><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What dost thou know of suffering and oppression! I and my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people know, but not thou.'  (Mark Twain, The Prince and the Pauper, public domain)<br /><br />
  In Ephesians 1:20-23, Paul gives a royal description of Christ Jesus.  He describes him as being above all rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named.  Paul, however, would argue that Jesus and the young prince in Mark Twain&rsquo;s book would have the same answer to those who would try and oppress others.  For Jesus&rsquo; rule is not based on power and might but on love &ndash; compassionate love for those in need.  This is what makes Christ the King.  He will dispense justice with compassion.</p>
  <h4>The Gospel Reading (Matthew 25:31-46)</h4>
  <p>As natural disasters and human catastrophe occur ever more frequently (or so it seems), questions that come to mind include: &ldquo;Is this the end?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Are we in the end times?&rdquo;  &ldquo;When is judgment day?&rdquo;  These questions are not unique to us.  They have been asked for thousands of years.  This parable that Jesus tells speaks of these end times but, as usual with Jesus, there is a twist that is not expected.</p>
  <p>Jesus begins the parable: The Son of Man will come and sit on his throne.  All the nations will be gathered around him and goats will be separated from sheep.  The sheep will be safe, the goats &hellip; well, not so much.</p>
  <p>In the parable it seems surprising that no one seems to know whether he or she is a sheep or a goat until the separation occurs.  After the King divides up everyone, he explains what has led to his decision &ndash; the sheep are those who had loving compassion when he was hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, or imprisoned.  The goats are those who did not.  Those who are &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; are shocked.  When did they help the king?  When was the king in need?  He explains that while they were waiting for his coming he had already come among them hidden among those in desperate circumstances.</p>
  <p>The two stories about the two churches that I mentioned at the beginning are convicting.  Church is not to be about a beautiful building or a place where some sort of &ldquo;tit for tat&rdquo; arrangement is set up between each person and Jesus (give money, you will get back money!).  Instead, we gather together in order to be sent out.  We gather to praise God, to receive forgiveness, to worship.  And we are then sent out to see and respond to the face of Jesus in all people &ndash; especially among those who are hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned.</p>
  <p>If we don&rsquo;t see this, if we don&rsquo;t recognize Jesus&rsquo; face in others, we are not alone.  Those in the parable didn&rsquo;t recognize the King&rsquo;s face, either.  But this parable jolts us out of our comfort zone.  It compels us to look upon ourselves critically.  And, hopefully, it leads us to justice with compassion by following the compassionate Christ the King, the compassionate shepherd, as his sheep.  Baaaa!!!!  </p>
  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;What does &ldquo;good shepherd&rdquo; mean to you?  How are the words from Ezekiel familiar &ldquo;good shepherd&rdquo; language?  What surprised you about this passage?</p>
<p>2.When has it been helpful for the good shepherd to find you?  Have you ever wanted to be lost from the good shepherd?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; What does the saying &ldquo;the writing on the wall&rdquo; mean to you?  How does that describe the graffiti on the church wall in the story I mentioned at the beginning?</p>
<p>4.  How is the Mark Twain&rsquo;s book The Prince and the Pauper similar to Jesus&rsquo; coming to earth?  How is it different?</p>
<p>5.  How do you hear the parable of the sheep and the goats?  Does it make you uncomfortable?  Does God’s grace fit into this parable?</p>
<p>6.  This is called “Christ the King” Sunday.  What does it mean to call Christ the King?
