<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ezra and
Nehemiah</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>These two books are considered together because they
offer an account of events after exiles returned from Babylon, namely
the rebuilding of the Temple and the walls of the city of Jerusalem.
In both books we find lists of returnees and of temple officials. The
books tells of the renewal of temple worship and the establishment of
a program of instruction - so that the legal and ritual traditions
would be handed down. For such teaching, Mosaic law was central, so
it is likely that the Law took close to its final form during Ezra's
time. The Law became the definitive reference for godly behaviour.
Part of Ezra is written in imperial Aramaic, the language used by the
Persian court in its dealings with subject peoples throughout the
Empire. </FONT>
</P>
<P>The books of Ezra and Nehemiah form one story. Ezra begins with
Cyrus of Persia&rsquo;s decree, in 538 BC, permitting the Jewish
exiles to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple, a venture in
which they are to be materially aided. Cyrus orders that the sacred
vessels taken from the Temple in 587 be returned. More than 42,000
leave Babylon for Judah. The altar is erected on the site of the
destroyed Temple; the priests again offer burnt offerings.
Construction of the new Temple begins: a more modest structure than
Solomon&rsquo;s.</P>
<P>But subversion arises among local people; they succeed in
convincing the king that the Jews plan a rebellion against Persian
rule, so he halts rebuilding. Eventually construction is allowed to
continue. Ezra, the scribe and priest, enters the picture in Ezra 7.
Commissioned by King Artaxerxes, he travels to Jerusalem with a wave
of exiles; he is &ldquo;to study the law of the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>
... and to teach the statutes and ordinances in Israel&rdquo; (Ezra
7:10), and to prepare the Temple for worship. He is to appoint
&ldquo;magistrates and judges&rdquo; (Ezra 7:25). Many scholars say
that Nehemiah 8 (and 7:73b) follow here (although Nehemiah 6:15-7:4
tell of the building of the walls of the city, including the &ldquo;Water
Gate&rdquo;, Nehemiah 8:1). The people who have come from Babylon are
now &ldquo;settled in their towns&rdquo; (Nehemiah 7:73b).</P>
<P>The &ldquo;book of the law of Moses&rdquo; (v. 1) is most likely
an earlier version of the biblical Leviticus: it is quoted in vv.
14-15. Note the stress on &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; (vv. 2, 3, 7).
V. 4 says that Ezra stood on a &ldquo;wooden platform&rdquo; or
<EM>tower</EM>. The people agree to obey the law (&ldquo;Amen&rdquo;,
v. 6). Ezra reads in Hebrew (v. 8); the Levites (priestly assistants)
translate into Aramaic (the common language) and &ldquo;gave the
sense&rdquo;, interpret it in the current context. Nehemiah is not
listed elsewhere as a &ldquo;governor&rdquo; (v. 9): here this is
probably a prestige title. Ezra declares the day &ldquo;holy&rdquo;,
a <EM>sabbath</EM>. It seems that what Ezra reads makes the people
sad, but he commands that they celebrate a feast: vv. 14-15 tell us
that this is the Festival of Booths (Tabernacles, <EM>Sukkoth</EM>).</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Sadness Turned To Joy</H4>
<P>Sometimes our sadness turns to joy when people celebrate the good
news of freedom.</P>
<P>This edited version of the passage celebrates the re-institution
of the religious and civil life in Jerusalem after the return of the
exiles from Babylon and the rebuilding of the city walls. (Rebuilding
of the walls was the first order of business, since the top priority
of the city was defense.) Standing at an official height and
surrounded by the city officials (edited out of the passage), Ezra
addressed the people. [2-5] After Ezra's blessing, the people
responded with approval in voice and posture. [6] Then Ezra read and
commented on the Law; it is possible he translated the Law for those
returning descendants who did not speak Hebrew, but Aramaic, the
language of the Babylonians. [7]</P>
<P>At hearing the Law, the people wept. [8] This is a social response
to the devastation the city endured. It was seen as God's punishment
for the nation's infidelity; weeping was a means of sorrow and
repentance.</P>
<P>But the city leaders declare a day of rejoicing, for the city is
secure and the people are now free to practice their religion and way
of life. [9-10]</P>
<P>As Americans, we cherish our freedom and our way of life. Let us
not forget they are gifts from God. We should not take them for
granted or presume they are the fruit of our own hands. For many
people in the world, they are good news!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the
land route from the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An
industrial and ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the
arts. Its inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul
answers two letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and
internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded.
Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57
AD. </FONT>
</P>
<P>Paul has told the Christians at Corinth that spiritual gifts come
through the Holy Spirit and are given by him, as he chooses, for the
benefit of the whole community. Now he turns to the nature of the
Church &ndash; using the analogy of the human body. Whatever our
ethnic or social origins, &ldquo;we were all baptised into one body&rdquo;
(v. 13), into the risen glorified body of Christ, and empowered by
the same Holy Spirit acting in the Church. V. 14 is key: the body
needs various members; so too the Church needs various spiritual
gifts, each making its own contribution. In vv. 15-20, Paul makes the
point that all members contribute in various ways to the welfare of
the whole. Diversity is rooted in, and contributes to, unity. In vv.
21-25, he says that each member needs every other member, whether he
or she be strong or weak (v. 22). Vv. 23-25 say that the instinct of
modesty reveals part of God&rsquo;s plan, e.g. by respecting our
&ldquo;less respectable members&rdquo;, we make them equally
respectable. This applies in the community as it does in the body. In
this way, the community is peaceable, without &ldquo;dissension&rdquo;;
each cares for others. When one suffers the whole community does (v.
26).</P>
<P>In vv. 27-28, Paul applies these principles: &ldquo;you&rdquo;,
Corinthian Christians, are both one body and individually its
members. Three groups with God-given and -appointed spiritual gifts
are especially important: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;apostles&rdquo; chosen to
	continue spreading the good news; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;prophets&rdquo;, those with
	new insights into God&rsquo;s plan; and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>those who teach the faith.</P>
</UL>
<P>He then lists some other gifts: some help the poor and needy;
others are leaders, managers, in church affairs. The questions in vv.
29-30 must surely be answered <EM>no</EM>. Perhaps v. 31a suggests
that all seek to grow in the use of the gifts, great or small, given
to them.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>From <A HREF="http://www.word-sunday.com/">http://www.word-sunday.com/</A></H4>
<P>This long reading presented Paul&rsquo;s argument for unity in the
Church, despite competing leaders with different spiritual gifts. The
argument can be divided into thesis, argument, explanation of
problems with the argument, and a corollary of the argument.</P>
<P>Thesis: Members and the Body</P>
<P>12:13 This verse was built around an &ldquo;A-B-A&rdquo;
structure. The &ldquo;A&rdquo; (the Spirit) highlighted the &ldquo;B&rdquo;
(the baptized into the Body of Christ). The four different groups in
the community defined the ethnic backgrounds (Jew vs. everyone else)
and the legal status (slave vs. free) of the community. This
divergent lot was formed by and shared in the Spirit.</P>
<P>Last week we briefly explored the spiritual gifts. Cliques among
the Corinthian faithful used these gifts to support their claims of
leadership within the community. Their struggles were tearing the
community apart.</P>
<P>In response, Paul implied a hierarchy of gifts that began with
wisdom and spiritual knowledge. Such charisms as miracles, healing,
tongues, and interpretation were farther down the list. His list
foreshadowed his discussion of order within the Church (presented
here).</P>
<P>Before he listed the order of the Church, he had to argue for an
order within the Church. His argument was simple. Underneath the
diversity of people and activities in the Church, there was a real
unity of believers in Christ. That unity was brought about by the
Spirit. The Spirit brought different people together (Jew and
Gentile) from different strata of society (slave and free) into a
single, living reality.</P>
<P>Argument Supporting the Thesis: Rhetorical Questions and
Statements</P>
<P>12:15, 16 &rdquo;is it not (really) from the body&rdquo; This
clause has a double negative (&ldquo;not...not&rdquo;) for emphasis.
The use of &ldquo;really&rdquo; is a attempt to make this emphasis
apparent in English.</P>
<P>To use charisms as an argument for leadership not only undercut
unity within the community, it led to absurd conclusions. Using a
biological analogy, Paul presented a list of rhetorical questions and
statements to prove the absurdity of the power grab.</P>
<P>Explanation: Unity Even With Honor and Shame in the Body</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s analogy could break down with the question of
&ldquo;weaker&rdquo; members arose. The term &ldquo;weaker&rdquo;
could refer to the physically weak or the morally weak. How would the
community care for the sick and discipline the sinner?</P>
<P>Paul stuck to his biological argument with language that reflected
his culture: honor and shame. What could the community do with the
shameful sinner? Honor him! In other words, the sinner who repented
became the model for Christian living, not the righteous who never
sinned. After all, Jesus called the shameful and dishonorable into
his assembly. And, by the analogy, there was no reason to honor the
righteous (12:24a). But, for those who did not repent, there were
consequences (see 1 Corinthians 5).</P>
<P>Finally, like the body, the honorable and shameful were mixed
together by God so they could care for each other. He would explain
this spirit of charity in greater detail (see 1 Corinthians 13). But,
for the meantime, the saint and sinner were in the same &ldquo;boat&rdquo;
together. Their destinies were the same. They would celebrate their
glories together. They would mourn their losses together.</P>
<P>Corollary: Structure of Church Leadership</P>
<P>In this conclusion to the spiritual gifts and ministries, Paul put
the onus back on those who fought for leadership. The community of
the faithful at Corinth was the Body of Christ. Each one of its
members had a place in it. But each one could not be a leader. In
fact there was a hierarchy of leadership that paralleled the
hierarchy of gifts. Again, Paul used rhetorical questions to point
out that turf fights led to absurd conclusions. Not all are called to
a particular role in the community. God called each by his own
design. Each member was to make the Spirit known, in his or her own
way. The way God wanted the member to.</P>
<P>God calls us the same way Paul described. Not everyone is called
to leadership. Most of us are called to service. But, never fear. God
does call each and every one of us. To show the world the power of
the Spirit.</P>
<P><I>How have you been called by God to serve others? What
leadership roles have you taken in the community? How have you
served? How has the Spirit made itself known in your service?</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the
third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament.
Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on
some of his missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via
Matthew), a collection of sayings (known as Q for </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2>Quelle</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2>)
and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the
poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers.
Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he
wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>Jesus has been tempted by the devil in the wilderness (vv. 1-13)
to misuse his power for his personal benefit, for worldly domination,
and for protection from God&rsquo;s plan fulfilled on the cross. Now
he returns to Galilee. Jesus customarily attends synagogue services
to worship and present his message; it is there that Luke tells us
who Jesus is: he stands in continuity with God&rsquo;s promises of
old. Jesus is a great teacher; he has great authority in telling
people about God and his plan. Jesus begins with one part of the
scroll, <EM>flips</EM> to another, and <EM>flips</EM> back: vv. 18-19
emphasize his mission to those who are &ldquo;poor&rdquo; in any way,
be it financially, in spirit, in health. In &ldquo;the year of the
Lord&rsquo;s favour&rdquo;, the jubilee year, debts were forgiven and
slaves were set free. Jesus applies these verses to himself: he
performs the works of the Messiah then expected. He then sits to
interpret the readings: he says that God&rsquo;s plan is now being
completed (&ldquo;fulfilled&rdquo;, v. 21).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>What news has excited you recently? How has that
news changed your daily life? How has it given you hope?</I></P>
<P>&quot;City Under Siege!&quot; screamed the headlines.</P>
<P>Much of what the media presents as news turns out to be nothing
more than tidbits meant to shock. This shock gives us two insights.
We are glad we are not the people with problems. Yet we watch and
listen to the shock because we get caught up in the story. We are
only affected by the shock with feelings of relief and, maybe, with
the pangs of hidden guilt.</P>
<P>Once in while, we hear something that can change our lives for the
better. Something that will affect us dramatically, nonetheless. This
is &quot;Good News.&quot;</P>
<P>Luke wrote a life of Jesus for someone new to the faith as &quot;Good
News.&quot; And Jesus proclaimed the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy
as &quot;Good News.&quot; Both give us insight into the reason for
and the content of &quot;Gospel.&quot;</P>
<P>Today's split reading emphasized the notion of Gospel. The first
set of verses stressed how the Good News came to be written and an
insight why it was written. The second set stressed the core of the
Good News, a thumbnail of what the Good News was all about.</P>
<P>1:1-4 As the formal translation indicates above, v. 1-4 constitute
one long sentence. The main clause can be found in 1:3. 1:1
introduced the reason for the Gospel (while 1:2 explained 1:1). 1:4
was the desired result of 1:3 (writing to inform the potential or new
believer).</P>
<P>1:1 &quot;a narrative about the things having happened among us
and having fully convinced (us)&quot; This is a vague phrase. The
word for &quot;things&quot; is &quot;pragma&quot; (from which we get
the word &quot;pragmatic&quot;). It can refer to events or items. The
two verbs &quot;having happened&quot; and &quot;having fully
convinced&quot; are actual one Greek verb that can have two meanings.
Hence, the phrase can be translated &quot;a narrative about the
events that has happened.&quot; Or, it can be translated &quot;a
narrative about the things having fully convinced us.&quot; The first
possibility referred to a historical perspective, the second referred
to a faith perspective. As a unique genre in literature, Gospel
provides both perspectives.</P>
<P>1:2 &quot;just as (the things) handed over to us&quot; The things
referred to the &quot;pragmata&quot; (events and faith items in 1:1.
But, when the noun is added to the verb &quot;handed over,&quot; the
understood subject takes on the sense of tradition or the entire
group of events and faith items. So, Luke was trying to present the
tradition he received from the apostolic generation (&quot;the eye
witnesses&quot; and &quot;the ministers of the word&quot;) to the
next generation of believers.</P>
<P>1:3 &quot;it seemed to me, having investigated all things
accurately from (their) beginning, to write in an orderly (manner)
for you&quot; Because of the shades of meaning in the verb &quot;having
investigated&quot; (literally, &quot;having followed&quot;), the
adverb &quot;accurately&quot; could shift to the infinitive &quot;to
write.&quot; And, it could shift the meaning of &quot;from before&quot;;
it would no longer indicate a point in time (&quot;from their
beginning&quot; as used in the translation above) to a period of time
(&quot;for a long time&quot;) The translation could then be: &quot;it
seemed to me, having followed all things for a long time, to write in
an orderly and accurate way for you.&quot; To translate the phrase in
this way, however, would indicate that Luke was also some sort of
witness, which he was not. He was not a bystander to the events as
they unfolded, but a writer who compiled reports of the events and
presented them. His perspective, then, was one of investigator who
looked backward through the past.</P>
<P>1:3-4 &quot;most excellent Theophilus, in order that you might
know exactly about the reliability of the things which you have been
taught.&quot; &quot;most excellent Theophilus&quot; can also be
translated &quot;your excellence, Theophilus.&quot; Was &quot;most
excellent&quot; a title or a compliment? Indeed, was the name
Theophilus (meaning &quot;lover of God) a formal name or a nickname?
The lack of supporting evidence will always leave this person
shrouded in mystery. Combined with 1:4, we do know the person (or
persons) was attracted to Christianity or was a neophyte.</P>
<P>While the verb &quot;to teach&quot; (&quot;catecheo&quot;)
indicated an introduction to or deepening of the faith, the word does
not support the view this was an instruction in the formal process of
joining the Church. There was no evidence that a class of catechumens
existed in the time of Luke. However, the intent of the Gospel was
catechetical. See the commentary for more thoughts.</P>
<P>This long sentence explained the reason for the Gospel. Why did it
exist? Luke wrote his Gospel as a means to pass on the faith,
especially to a new believer. Luke's Gospel was meant to be a
catechetical tool. He wrote to solidify what a new believer had
already learned.</P>
<P>Did Luke write a biography of Jesus? Not in the modern sense of
unbiased facts in a chronological order. Luke was interested in the
facts, of course. But he was more interested in using those facts to
explain why the Church community existed and why that community
believed. The life of Jesus answered those questions. But Luke had to
use the facts of Jesus's life in an order that explained and promoted
faith. He set out to write a Gospel, not a mere biography.</P>
<P>Luke throughly investigated the tradition he received from the
contemporaries of Jesus and &quot;ministers of the word.&quot; In
other words, he came from the post-apostolic generation. He wanted to
preserve the stories and teachings of Jesus that floated around the
community for his generation. But, just as important, he wanted to
frame those stories to promote faith among his contemporaries. He
would take the stories and teachings that had already lost the
context of Jesus' culture. And he would place them in the context of
his culture. Luke wrote his gospel as an expression of his faith and
the faith of his peers.</P>
<P>Before Luke, some had tried to gather the stories and teachings
together. Indeed, modern scholars think Luke used Mark and the
so-called &quot;Q&quot; source for his gospel. 
</P>
<P>(&quot;Q&quot; is shorthand for &quot;quelle,&quot; the German
word for &quot;source.&quot; More than 600 verses have been
identified that Luke and Matthew have in common, but are not found in
Mark or John. Taken by themselves, these verses seem to form a
document like Proverbs, a list of wise sayings and short vignettes
that could be used as a teaching tool for memorization. Studies have
been done over the past two decades on the &quot;Q,&quot; but we must
remember this &quot;document&quot; is purely theoretical at this
point in time. No document or partial document has ever been found to
positively prove its existence.)</P>
<P>Luke's comments seem to indicate the process of gathering and
collating material about Jesus was an active pursuit in the Christian
community. After all, some fifty years had passed from the death of
Jesus to the writing of Luke's gospel. The Church was growing rapidly
and so was the hunger of new Christians to learn about the life of
their Lord. The generation of eye witnesses was also dying out. A
written Gospel would help bridge the gap of time and feed the needs
Christian communities removed from the Christ event by two or three
generations.</P>
<P>4:18-19 These verses can be found in Isaiah 61:1-2. The purpose of
the Spirit anointing was the preaching of the Good News to the poor.
In this case, the poor are not necessarily the economically needy.
The poor are those who depend solely upon God, not upon their own
abilities or the people/circumstances around them.</P>
<P>The three activities after 4:18a explained what Isaiah meant by
preaching Good News. First, the preacher would proclaim freedom to
prisoners and sight to blind. Next, he would lift oppression from
backs of the ordinary people. Finally, he would proclaim a Jubilee
year, a year that would forgive debts both socially and economically.
Hence, the Good News was meant for outsider: the prisoner, the blind,
the oppressed, and those heavily in debt. Of course, the message was
more than literal. Those spiritually in prison, blinded, oppressed,
and indebted were to hear the message.</P>
<P>4:20 &quot;Having rolled up the scroll, having handed (it) back to
the (synagogue) attendant, HE sat (down).&quot; After the
proclamation of the prophet, Jesus assumed the teacher's position.</P>
<P>4:21 &quot;while you heard it&quot; is literally &quot;in your
ears.&quot; An alternate translation of the sentence could be &quot;Today,
the scripture that you heard has been fulfilled.&quot; The
translation above stressed the act of listening as the means of
fulfillment. The translation in this footnote stressed the fact of
fulfillment.</P>
<P>Now we know why Luke wrote his gospel. But, what was the Good
News? In the synagogue of his own hometown, Jesus read a prophecy
from Isaiah and proclaimed its fulfillment. Why this prophecy? Why
was it fulfilled? Both questions could be answered in one word: the
Spirit.</P>
<P>The driving force in the Gospel of Luke was God's Spirit. The
Spirit descended upon Jesus at his Baptism. The Spirit drove Jesus
into the desert to be tested by Satan. And, now, the Spirit directed
Jesus upon his mission. A mobile ministry of teaching and healing, of
proclaiming the Good News.</P>
<P>With the verse from Isaiah, Jesus defined his ministry in Luke.
With the Spirit poured upon him, Jesus would proclaim freedom for the
trapped (captives), the diminished (blind), and those in need
(oppressed). And he would proclaim a time of God's favor, a year of
the Spirit. In other words, Jesus traveled to proclaim the freedom
found in the Spirit and a future time full of the Spirit.</P>
<P>When Jesus proclaimed the Good News, he proclaimed the Spirit.
Since Spirit meant breath, Jesus breathed God's word in his teaching
and his healing. The power of his proclamation changed people,
situations, and environments because he breathed out the power of
God. When Jesus spoke, hearts turned to God and health was restored.</P>
<P>Not only did the proclamation of Jesus affect the present, it
revealed the future. The year of God's favor was a Spirit-driven
time, the end-times. No doubt, Jesus used 4:19a to justify his
eschatological vision. The Kingdom and the Spirit could not be
separated. As the Spirit blew in the present, so it would blow in the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: The Proclamation of the Kingdom (CCC 543-545)</P>
<P>When Jesus proclaimed Isaiah's prophecy fulfilled, he proclaimed
the presence of the Kingdom. With his proclamation, Jesus invited
everyone to enter, Jew and Gentile alike. To enter the Kingdom,
however, we must accept his word. In doing so, we become dependent
upon him to lead us to the Father. &quot;The kingdom belongs to 'the
poor and lowly,' which means those who have accepted it with humble
hearts.&quot; (CCC 544) With the proclamation of the Kingdom comes an
invitation to receive the Spirit, its guidance and its consolation.</P>
<P><I>How have you experienced the Good News? How have you seen the
power of the Spirit in this experience?</I></P>
<P>In this short reflection, we've looked at the content and the
reason for the Good News. The Good News is a revelation of God's
presence among us. In Luke, the activity of the Spirit represents
that presence. Jesus proclaimed that presence now and at the end of
time.</P>
<P>Luke wrote his gospel to distill the oral faith tradition that
immersed him. And he wrote it to promote that faith tradition to his
contemporaries. Our reflections on Luke's gospel fulfill his purpose
for writing it.</P>
<P>The Spirit compelled Jesus to proclaim the Kingdom. But, when the
Spirit began to blow, it did not cease. It breathed through the
community, right onto the pages of Luke. And it continues to breathe
among us, in our worship, in our studies, in our faith sharing, and
in our service to the poor, the blind, and the oppressed. It compels
us to proclaim, as Jesus did, a year of the Lord's favor.</P>
<P><I>As you reflect on Luke's message, look at this coming week and
ask yourself one question. Where does the Spirit blow in your life?</I></P>
