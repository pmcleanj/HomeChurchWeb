<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to the right
date. Epiphany is our time of showing Christ forth into the world.
Christ was &ldquo;shown forth&rdquo; in the miraculous signs that
surrounded his birth, not only to his own people, but to the entire
world, as evidenced by the visit of the Magi. The other great signs
of Christ's life were also signs to the whole world. Over the weeks
of Epiphany, the Gospel readings will review for us many of those
signs that reveal who Christ is.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
