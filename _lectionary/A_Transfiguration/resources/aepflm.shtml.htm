<b>Exodus</b>
</small><p>
<small>Exodus is the second book of the Old Testament, and is part of the Pentateuch,
the first five books of the Bible. Jews refer to these books as "The Torah".
At times, they are referred to as "The Law", although "Torah" means <i>teaching</i>.
Exodus centres on the rescue of God's chosen people from captivity in Egypt
and the making of the great covenant, or agreement with God, at Mount Sinai.

<strong>Exodus 24:12-18</strong>
<p>In <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+22%3A22-23%3A33" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22:22-23:33</a>, Moses

Moses has told them to the people; they have agreed to their side of
the Covenant. (God&#8217;s side is to be their god and to protect them.)
Moses has then written down all God has told him. The pact, the union
between God and the people, has been ratified in blood, &#8220;the blood of
the covenant&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+24%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). Blood has been dashed against 
the altar (symbolizing God) and sprinkled on the people. (Vv.

<p>Now God offers to put all the laws in permanent form, on &#8220;tablets of
stone&#8221;. So important is Moses&#8217; ascent of the mountain that it is
mentioned four times in vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+24%3A12-18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12-18</a>. Moses leaves &#8220;the

bright &#8220;cloud&#8221;, veiling his being: the people can see the cloud, but not God. Unlike the light from the Burning Bush (Chapter

frightening &#8220;like a devouring fire&#8221; (v.

is reminiscent of the Flood, of the time the Israelites scouted out
Canaan&#8217;s defences before entering the Promised Land, and of Elijah&#8217;s
later experience on the same mountain. It is a considerable length of
time.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 2</strong>
<p>This psalm was probably written for the coronation of a king of
Judah. Vassal kings (and their peoples) plot rebellion &#8211; perhaps the
new king will be weak. Political rebellion against the Lord&#8217;s

to revolt against God himself. Vv.

<em>messiah</em> in the Hebrew. A title of an Israelite king, after the
demise of the monarchy it became the name of the ideal future king who
would restore Israel to glory. In Acts, Peter, John and others apply
this title to Jesus, and Paul speaks of the risen Christ as God&#8217;s son.</p>

<b>2 Peter</b>

<small>The author wrote this letter because he realized that he was approaching 
death and wished to leave to his fellow Christians a testimony: a 
statement of what being a Christian entails, how they should live in 
order to be judged worthy of the kingdom when Christ returns. Most 
scholars believe that the author was not Peter because, from internal 
evidence, it was not written until at least 90 AD, by which time Peter 
was dead. For example, it refers to Paul's letters as "scripture". His 
letters only became part of the collection of Christian writings long 
after Paul's death.

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

when the city was brightly lit. On Sinai too a &#8220;bright cloud&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+17%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
symbolized God&#8217;s presence. The words spoken by the voice recall Jesus&#8217;
baptism and add &#8220;&#8216;listen to him&#8217;&#8221;: Jesus is not only God&#8217;s Son and his
Chosen, but also the prophet God promised to Moses.</p>
<p>Early Christians knew the book of Daniel well. Vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+17%3A6-7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6-7</a> would tell them that this 
&#8220;vision&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+17%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) is 
linked to the end times: see Daniel

<em>son of man</em> in the Hebrew). Moses and Elijah vanish into
insignificance, leaving Jesus alone. The Church Fathers saw the
Transfiguration as fulfilling Jesus&#8217; prediction that some would not die
until they had seen the coming of God&#8217;s kingdom; others saw the event
as a prophecy of the Second Coming.</p>
