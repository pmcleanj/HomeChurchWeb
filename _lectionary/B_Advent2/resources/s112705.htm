<br>We?re mindful of the setting of today?s reading from Isaiah, the
historical situation of the people of ancient Israel, at the end of the
exile, struggling to make sense of their experience and seeking to live
faithfully, in its wake. And we are also mindful of our own setting, in
time and historical circumstances. Pastors preach this text at the
beginning of Advent, when the culture around us is turning its
attention toward shopping and decorations, and the anticipation of
gifts and celebration. However, the very first line of Scripture for
this new church year is a dramatic and perhaps frightening one, for who
could long for the sky to open up and the might of God to be revealed?
(Wasn?t it Annie Dillard who suggested we wear crash helmets to
church?) Much of our watching, waiting, and hoping (and this is true
not just of our children) is geared toward December 25 rather than the
fullness of the reign of God or the return of Christ in glory. Few of
us look around at the state of the world, our own personal world or the
community and world that surrounds us, and look to God to ?tear open
the heavens and come down.? We would prefer quieter, more ?reasonable?
solutions, no doubt. The people of ancient Israel, however, held in
their hearts the story of God?s previous visitations, on Sinai, for
example, and they remember the marvelous signs of such a remarkable
event. In making sense of their predicament, they blame their suffering
on their sin. No wonder God doesn?t come back when the people are
unclean and unstable, dirty like a used rag and blowing about like a
leaf in the wind. But then they also remind God that they are God?s
children, and they are the work of God?s hands, like the clay formed
into something, something of value in the end. Even if it takes a long
time, God will consider, God will give us another look and remember
that we are precious in God?s sight, and that God has made promises to
us. ?We are your responsibility, your burden, your problem, your
treasured possession?Israel?s deep trust in Yahweh is matched by
Yahweh?s deep obligation to Israel? (Brueggemann et al, Texts for
Preaching, Year B). In recent years it seems that preachers have lifted
up the themes of waiting for the fulfillment we long for (beyond
Christmas, that is), but the ?already? part of ?already/not yet? has
been more difficult to address. William F. Brosend II reflects on
preaching in Advent on the ?watching, waiting, being patient? theme as
better expressed as being ?present.? ?Whether we speak with Brother
Lawrence of ?practicing the presence of God? or with the Vietnamese
Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh of ?dwelling fully in the present
moment,? a constant temptation or opportunity is to ignore or attend to
the present?The greatest Advent gift we have to offer is the gift of
presence ? our presence to the needs and desires of the congregation
and our opportunity to help them attend to the presence of the coming
one already in their midst? (New Proclamation, Year B Advent through
Holy Week, 2005, Fortress Press). Deep down, what do you think is the
greatest longing of the people in your congregation? What is underneath
the things that appear to be shallow aspirations and occupations? What
are predicaments and afflictions that might cause a ?lament? such as
Isaiah?s to rise from your congregation? If your congregation is clay
in the hand of a loving and committed potter, what great work is taking
shape right before your eyes? How has God been faithful to your
congregation in times past? What is the ground of our hope and our
expectation? When you think of God as a loving and committed father,
how can you imagine yourself or your church as children of God who are
God?s ?responsibility, burden, problem, treasured possession.? What is
the still-speaking God doing in your midst even now, before all things
have come to fulfillment?<!-- END SERMON SEEDS -->

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a
Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and
liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister
to read all of the lessons.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the
lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or
recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is
appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way.
The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with
refrains and music.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">During
Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first
option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture;
the second is thematically related to the other readings.</font></font></p><p>
