<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Jeremiah</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born
or began his ministry in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded
Assyria as the dominant power in the Middle East. He was a witness to
the return to worship of the Lord (instituted by the Judean king
Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death in battle in 609), the return
of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon captured Jerusalem in
587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be a prophet to
Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political and
religious convulsions. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Jeremiah 17:5-10</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The ideas expressed in this reading are atypical for Jeremiah&rsquo;s
time; they seem to reflect the thinking of later centuries, when
books of wisdom literature (e.g. Proverbs, Wisdom) were written. God,
through the prophet Jeremiah, contrasts the fates of the ungodly and
the godly. The ungodly purposely &ldquo;turn away&rdquo; from God;
they &ldquo;trust&rdquo; (believe) in humankind&rsquo;s power and
strength. On the other hand, the godly truly &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in
God. V. 6 likens the ungodly to a &ldquo;shrub&rdquo;: it dies in the
desert sun. But the godly (v. 8) are like a &ldquo;green&rdquo;
&ldquo;tree&rdquo;: sustained (&ldquo;water&rdquo;) and growing with
the help of the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; (perhaps God&rsquo;s Spirit).
They have nothing to worry about (&ldquo;not anxious&rdquo;, v. 8).</P>
<P>To ancient peoples, the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; (v. 9) was not only
the centre of emotions, feelings, moods and passions but also of will
and motive power for the limbs. The heart discerned good from evil;
it was also the centre of decision-making. Conversion to God&rsquo;s
ways took place in the heart. In v. 9, it is said to be where evil
begins. Only God can see clearly the intentions of the heart; only he
can properly judge humans in their actions. God rewards people for
the good they do, and condemns them for evil deeds. In v. 11, God
reminds the reader that, in the end, wealth acquired unjustly does
not benefit a person, for it does not extend his life. (The notion of
life after death was yet to be realized.)</P>

<H4>Barren and Lush Plants</H4>
<P>In the midst of his prophecy, Jeremiah compared the good and evil
persons with a analogy from the plant world. The evil person was like
the desert plant that knew no season, who only knew harsh conditions.
[5-6] Why was this person cursed to unchanging barrenness? Notice who
the person trusted, his friends and his own self (&quot;flesh&quot;
of v. 5). This person depended on his/her looks, intelligence, or
personality to persuade; he/she used wealth or friendships to promote
his/her position. The person who depended only on the self and
his/her friends did not see the greater picture and did not
experience the greatness of God. Because of blind selfishness, the
evil person did not grow emotionally or spiritually; he/she would
never know joy.</P>
<P>The good person did grow because he/she trusted in God. The trust
of a good person went beyond looks or intelligence or personality or
friends. When those qualities failed (the &quot;heat&quot; and
&quot;drought&quot; of v. 6-7), a spiritual life would keep the good
person enriched and productive. The good person would spiritually
mature and would know joy.</P>
<P>&quot;All assets are liabilities; all liabilities are assets.&quot;
Our talents can be our burdens; our burdens can be turned into
talents. To see this paradox requires faith, firm trust in God.</P>
<P><I>What are your burdens and your talents? How can they give God
glory?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Psalms</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 1</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>This psalm contrasts the fate of the godly and the ungodly (as
does our reading from Jeremiah.) Vv. 1-3 speak of the happiness of
the godly. They do not live as the ungodly do; rather they constantly
(&ldquo;day and night&rdquo;, v. 2) and joyfully study and observe
Mosaic law; their well-being is like trees which bear fruit; they are
prosperous. On the other hand, the ungodly are like &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;
(v. 4): in manual threshing, the wind blows it away; it is discarded.
So, says v. 5, their fate will be disaster: they will be excluded
from the fellowship enjoyed by those who follow God&rsquo;s ways, and
will suffer &ndash; unlike the godly, over whom God keeps watch.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1 Corinthians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the
land route from the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An
industrial and ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the
arts. Its inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul
answers two letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and
internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded.
Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57
AD. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>1 Corinthians 15:12-20</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul continues his argument against those at Corinth who deny that
Christians will be resurrected bodily. He has written of three basic
doctrines he has received and passed on: Christ died, was buried, and
rose. Perhaps he is countering some who attached all importance to
the spirit, thus neglecting physical, earthly, living. Perhaps they,
under the influence of the philosopher Philo of Alexandria, believed
that they already possessed eternal life. For such people,
resurrection would be meaningless. It was commonly thought that only
the soul is immortal. He now confronts these people with a logical
argument and the consequences of their denial, and tells the benefits
of affirming resurrection.</P>
<P>In v. 12, he restates a point: a tenet of our faith is that Jesus
physically rose after being dead. He did this as a human being, so
how can some argue that physical resurrection of humans does not
exist? In vv. 13ff, he states five logical consequences if these
people are correct: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jesus was not raised (vv. 13,16); 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Paul&rsquo;s (&ldquo;our&rdquo;,
	v. 14) preaching is &ldquo;in vain&rdquo;, unproductive, i.e. has
	not introduced anything new into his readers&rsquo; lives; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the faith of his readers is
	&ldquo;futile&rdquo; (v. 17), ineffective, pointless, so they are
	still subject to God&rsquo;s wrath for their sins (vv. 14, 17); 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">he has taught something about God
	which is not true (v. 15) and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>those Christians &ldquo;who have died&rdquo; (v. 18) are
	definitively lost (&ldquo;have perished&rdquo;).</P>
</UL>
<P>Then v. 19: if our faith in Christ stops with his death (i.e. does
not include his raising), we are living a hoax, and a tough one:
Christian life involves suffering, disappointment, etc., so we are
&ldquo;most to be pitied&rdquo;. Jesus&rsquo; death alone doesn&rsquo;t
gain forgiveness of sins (v. 17): it&rsquo;s his resurrection that
does. If he did not rise, we are caught in affirming death rather
than life. But, says Paul (v. 20), Jesus really was raised. In fact,
he was the <EM>forerunner</EM>, the <EM>model</EM> for all those who
have died (and of those yet to die). The &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo;
of the harvest (the initial yield) was offered to God as a symbol of
offering the whole harvest to him.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in">What If...</H4>
<P>15:12-13 &ldquo;resurrection from the dead&rdquo; The word for
resurrection was &ldquo;anastasis&rdquo; in Greek, meaning &ldquo;standing
up.&rdquo; This was a popular word for resurrection in the New
Testament.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Alternate history&rdquo; has become a popular parlor game
in the last fifty years. Popular novels and academic papers have been
written to speculate on how history would have changed if one or two
details changed. &ldquo;What if...&rdquo; is a interesting mental
exercise.</P>
<P>Paul used the &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; question to argue for the
resurrection of the dead. Without the possibility of such a
resurrection, the belief that Christ rose from the dead would be
irrational. Take away the resurrection of Christ and the entire
construct of Christianity would crumble. Preaching and faith would be
in vain. Missionaries would be deluded at best, liars at worst.
Either way, they would be shamed for their gullibility or duplicity.
The faithful would discover they did not have that status. They would
still be sinners. And believers who had died would be lost forever.
Like the missionaries, they would have a shameful status as the most
pathetic people on the planet.</P>
<P>Paul followed the logical path down the negative to implicitly ask
a rhetorical question: if you did not believe in the resurrection of
the dead, why were you Christians? Like some in the community at
Corinth, many self-proclaimed Christians today do not subscribe to
the doctrine of the resurrection. For them, the resurrection is a
metaphor. After winter comes spring. After defeat comes triumph.
After depression comes ecstacy. For people like these, Christianity
is a group of teachings and wise sayings that sooth the harried
psyche. But, if faith in Christ is only good for therapy, why don&rsquo;t
we all close our parishes and go to the beach instead? Certainly,
that environment would be more conducive to the realization of &ldquo;warm
fuzzies.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Yes, Christianity does have teachings and wise sayings. Yes,
resurrection does have the power of metaphor. Yes, faith in Christ
does have the power to calm the waters of the hectic lifestyles we
live. But the root of Christianity is belief in the bodily
resurrection of the dead, beginning with that of Jesus. Certainly,
that doctrine, in conjunction with the movement of the Spirit, was
the basis for the establishment and subsequent health of the early
communities. Indeed, Jews and Gentiles would have not gathered
together in the name of an unknown Galilean just to share his wise
sayings that resulted in mutual good feelings.</P>
<P>Paul believed the end times were immanent. In these times
everything would return to God. In his death and resurrection, the
Risen Lord was the first movement of the world back to God. As
Christians, we believe that we will be part of that movement. If we
do not, then our spiritual life is futile. No matter how wise
teachings and metaphor lower our blood pressure now, in the long run
Christianity would be a matter of &ldquo;spinning our wheels.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Thank God Christ did rise from the dead. Thank God we will be him,
body and soul, at the end. Thank God, Christianity is not alternate
history, a case of &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>What would your life be without faith in the resurrection? How
does faith in the Risen Lord change your perspective on life?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><BR><B>Luke</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 6:17-26</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus has ascended a mountain to pray. While there, he has chosen
twelve of his disciples, his followers, to be apostles. Now he
descends part-way, to a &ldquo;level place&rdquo;. There he finds
other followers and many others, from Israel and beyond (&ldquo;Tyre
and Sidon&rdquo;, v. 17). Many are healed, both of known &ldquo;diseases&rdquo;
(v. 18) and of <EM>being possessed</EM>. Evil &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;
made them ritually &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; so they were not permitted
to share in corporate worship of God.</P>
<P>Luke tells us of four <EM>beatitudes</EM> (vv. 20-22) and
corresponding <EM>woes</EM> or warnings of deprivation in the age to
come. Some are &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; (happy) by being included in the
Kingdom Jesus brings. The warnings are prophecies, cautions. The
pairs are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the &ldquo;poor&rdquo; (v. 20) and
	the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; (v. 24); 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; (v. 21a)
	and the &ldquo;full&rdquo; (v. 25a);

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the sorrowful (v. 21b) and the
	joyous (v. 25b); and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>the persecuted (v. 22) and the popular (v. 26).</P>
</UL>
<P>The &ldquo;poor&rdquo; (v. 20) are those who acknowledge their
dependence on God; the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; (v. 24) do not want to
commit themselves to Jesus and the Kingdom; they are comfortable with
the existence they have now. The Greek word translated &ldquo;consolation&rdquo;
(v. 24) is a financial term: the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; do not realize
what they owe to Jesus. The &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; (v. 25) hunger for
the word of God, the good news; the &ldquo;full&rdquo; are the
materially satisfied. In v. 22, &ldquo;exclude&rdquo; means socially
ostracized and excluded from the synagogue and Temple. The &ldquo;Son
of Man&rdquo; has a corporate sense: it includes Jesus and his
followers: they will be persecuted, as Israel (&ldquo;their
ancestors&rdquo;, v. 23) persecuted Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Amos, but
&ldquo;in that day&rdquo; (at the end of the era), they will be
rewarded. Jeremiah 5:31 says that people spoke well of &ldquo;false
prophets&rdquo; (v. 26).</P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in">O Brother
(or Sister), Who Art Thou?</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When was your last act of charity? When was the last
time you did some good for someone else?</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In 2000, Hollywood's Coen brothers produced another of
their handcrafted movies. &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a
hilarious story of three prisoners who escape the chain gang to seek
a fortune. Based upon Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; the movie lightly
touches upon the more serious themes of divine providence and
personal moral change. The story turns on the sought goal: personal
gain or the good of others. Personal gain enchains the spirit, while
the good of others washes one clean of the past. (A hint for those
who wish to see the movie: watch for the many baptismal references.)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In Luke's four beatitudes and woes, Jesus spoke to the
same goals with a simple, but implied question. O Brother (or
Sister), who art thou: poor or rich?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In Luke, Jesus compared the rich and the poor in four
parallels: status, possessions, entertainment, and Christian witness.
The poor were blessed by God. The rich were blessed by self. Which
blessing would last?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:17 &quot;HE stood on level ground&quot; Unlike the
rocky peaks of the hills, this phrase seemed to refer to the slope of
the hills or mountains where a large following could gather.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;a great number of people from all (over) Judea,
and Jerusalem and along the coast of Tyre and Sidon.&quot; Luke
indicated people came from the populated areas northwest and south of
Galilee to hear Jesus. The reputation was more than local or
regional. It reached the Gentile areas of modern-day south Lebanon
and the orthodox City of David. In other words, Jesus' audience was
Jew and Gentile alike.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>6:22 Exclusion, public insult, and denial form the
process of excommunication from the synagogue. Exclusion was
physical; the person is no longer welcome to the synagogue or
association with the Jewish community. Insult was public and social;
there was a concerted effort to destroy the reputation of the
excommunicated. The final step was denial; one's name was cast out
from the rolls of the community. No one used the name of the
excommunicated. At this point, the community did not even recognize
the existence of person thrown out.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Luke liked to turn conventional wisdom upside down.
Looking through God's eyes, he contrasted the blessed with the
cursed. Before we compare these two groups, we must remember that
Jesus' audience was poor; they believed that wealth was acquired at
their expense through dishonest and oppressive means. We must also
remember that Jesus was addressing his disciples, those who have
given up the quest for riches in order to achieve something greater.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Luke differentiated the &quot;poor&quot; from the
&quot;rich&quot; by the focus of their attention. The poor would
inherit God's kingdom because that was where they set their sights;
their hope was in the future. [20] The rich, on the other hand, were
concerned with maintaining and enjoying what they already had; their
focus was upon the present gratification. [24] For Luke, the &quot;rich&quot;
were marked by their concern for money and what it could buy. Freed
from the temptation of money, the &quot;poor&quot; were marked by
their spiritual concern.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>To make his point, Luke paralleled three activities:
material needs (&quot;food&quot;), entertainment (&quot;laughter&quot;),
and reputation. Even through the poor did not have possessions, they
would be satisfied [21]; the rich had their needs fulfilled, but they
would not ultimately be satisfied [25]. Even though the poor cried
out for the opportunities that bring entertainment, they would be
filled with contentment [21]; the rich, on the other hand, would
simply crave more entertainment [25]. In the name of the kingdom, the
poor would be persecuted but will be honored like the prophets of old
[22-23]; concerned with present reputation, the rich would be quickly
forgotten [26].</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>For Luke, then, the difference between rich and poor
was more than money. The truly poor were those who were willing to
sacrifice material need, daily entertainment, and reputation for
God's kingdom. They were poor by choice, not by circumstance. The
truly rich were those who craved wealth and the comforts that it
could buy, even to the determent of others.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Catechism Theme: Social Justice and Solidarity (CCC
1943-1948)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>One of the hallmarks of modern morality is the emphasis
on the personal freedom and responsibility. The measuring stick of
morality seems to be: &quot;If my actions as an individual do not
injure others, then, the actions are permissible.&quot; Of course,
this ignores the broader picture. We, as individuals, form a society.
We contribute to that society in one form or another. Hence, we need
to take a certain responsibility for our society. Personal freedom
and responsibility do not preclude a sense of social justice.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;Social justice&quot; is the obligation of a
society to create conditions that allow individuals and groups to
receive what is owed them. (1943) The fundamental rights of the
individual and social equality flow from the dignity of the person.
Since all people have equal dignity, society should make an effort to
lessen social and economic inequality. (1944, 1947)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Christian virtue of &quot;solidarity&quot; is
&quot;social charity&quot;; it is a respect and love for others based
upon their dignity as people. Solidarity means a sharing of material
goods, and, more important, a sharing of faith and other spiritual
values. (1948)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In Luke's sense, the &quot;poor&quot; have a sense of
solidarity, for they focus on the good of others. The &quot;rich&quot;
in Luke's eyes, focus only on the self and the consequences of
actions on the self (while ignoring others).</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>How have you been involved in &quot;social justice&quot;
activities? How have they blessed you?</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Who art thou: poor or rich? We can look at the
difference another way. Love makes us economically poor but enriches
our lives; ambition makes us economically secure but leaves us
selfish and shallow. Our lives reveal our priorities. May God give us
the power to choose love over ambition, his Kingdom over present
riches.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>Obviously, we Christians have different priorities
in different at areas of life at different times. So the question of
selfless (poor) vs. selfish (rich) is not so clear cut. However, a
simple reflection over the past week can help you make changes for
the next week. What can you do to become a little &quot;poorer&quot;
and a little more &quot;blessed,&quot; this coming week?</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
