      <h2>Learning From Our Family Stories</h2>
Often on the campus of Pacific Lutheran University you can hear the
Christian students make references to the first century Christians
found in the book of Acts.&nbsp; They desire to be like those first
century Christians in terms of the passion they brought to their faith
and to their sharing of the Good News of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; If indeed
we are in a post-Christendom period as many say we are, these young
adults might have something to teach us old-timers who make the
assumption that we still live in a basically Christian culture.&nbsp;
They are right that we do need a rekindling of the Holy Spirit to find
that passion for preaching, teaching and sharing the Good News and
reaching out in response to the Good News with lives of service and
advocacy.<br>
      <br>
During these weeks of Easter, the Church lectionary invites us to get
in touch with our roots and to hear again the family stories of our
Christian ancestors.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks, our first reading
will come from the book of the Acts of the Apostles, our second reading
from First Peter, and our Gospel readings will be resurrection accounts
from John and Luke.&nbsp; There we will meet our ancestors in faith and
hear their stories, but this is not just an occasion to bring out the
family photo album, these stories are our stories and they are meant to
mold who we are, to remind us of our calling in baptism, to rekindle
the passion of hearing the Good News and sharing it with others, and to
show us how the resurrection of Jesus empowers people, then and now,
for lives of service.<br>
      <br>
In his book, &#8220;Dangerous Wonders&#8221; Mike Yaconelli laments that in our day
the Good News has become the Okay News.&nbsp; He laments, not unlike my
students, that we have lost the passion and we must pray for the Holy
Spirit to light the fire again.&nbsp; To steal a line from Patricia
Datchuck Sanchez, &#8220;The alleluias we sing are not only for what was, but
also for what is and what will forever be.&#8221;&nbsp; That is Good News
indeed.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel Reading<br>
      </h4>Obviously,
this text is rich in themes and images.&nbsp; There is no way we can do
justice to them in this WORDLINK.&nbsp; However, keeping in sight the
comments above, let us approach the text looking for those links to our
faith life today.<br>
      <br>
One thing you can say is that the Bible is brutally honest about the
faith lives of our Christian ancestors.&nbsp; We tend to think of them
as perfect models of faith who never do wrong when the truth is they
are real models of faith who sin and fail and from their brokenness try
to do the best they can to follow Jesus.<br>
      <br>
On the evening of Easter after seeing the empty tomb and hearing the
testimony of Mary Magdalene where do we find the disciples?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are they out boldly proclaiming the Good News as we might
suspect?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; They are behind locked doors out of fear of
being associated with Jesus!&nbsp; Oh, we can&#8217;t relate to that can
we?&nbsp; Fearful to be labeled a Christian, fearful that others might
discover that we believe in God and go to church on Sunday, that&#8217;s not
us.&nbsp; We are fearless proclaimers of the Good News, aren&#8217;t we?<br>
      <br>
Ah, but then Jesus comes into their fearful midst.&nbsp; We might
expect him to read them the riot act for deserting him when he faced
his darkest hour or at least chastise them for being fearful and behind
locked doors.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;d do if we were Jesus.&nbsp;
However, Jesus stands among them and says &#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;&nbsp;
And after Jesus showed them his hands and side, he breathed on them and
gave them the gift of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; (You would be correct in
assuming that John&#8217;s version of the giving of the Holy Spirit is
different than that of Luke as recorded in Acts 2.)<br>
      <br>
What does this tell us about Jesus?&nbsp; Might Jesus also come to us
in our fear and uncertainty and instead of belittling us for a lack of
faith, might not Jesus say, &#8220;Peace be with you.&nbsp; Receive the Holy
Spirit.&#8221;?<br>
      <br>
In the giving of the Holy Spirit, two things happen, the disciples are
sent as God sent Jesus (which indicates to me that they are to carry on
the mission and ministry of Jesus) and they are given the power to
forgive sins (that has more implications than one might think.&nbsp;
Not only can forgiveness remove guilt and reconcile people, but
remember how many of Jesus&#8217; physical healings were done through the
forgiveness of sins).<br>
      <br>
Are we not, since the Holy Spirit is given to us through baptism, also
sent to proclaim and serve?&nbsp; Are we not also given the power to
forgive sin and thereby bring peace, reconciliation, health and
wholeness?&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Finally, the story of &#8220;doubting&#8221; Thomas.&nbsp; Again, Jesus does not do
what we would expect.&nbsp; Accepting the doubt of Thomas, Jesus
declares peace to Thomas and shows him the proof Thomas demands to
see.&nbsp; What that says to me is that Jesus does not abandon us in
our doubts, but comes to us with peace and encouragement to believe and
to act on our belief.<br>
      <br>
One final note on the Gospel reading.&nbsp; I always have found it
fascinating that the resurrected Jesus still had the marks of his
crucifixion.&nbsp; Even in his resurrection, Jesus bears the brokenness
of human life.&nbsp; I find that very comforting and very encouraging
as I try to be a disciples of Jesus.<br>
      <br>

<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>Where we usually expect a reading from the Old Testament, during
the Church year season of Easter, our readings come from the book of
Acts.&nbsp; This week&#8217;s reading is a portion of Peter&#8217;s sermon on the
day of Pentecost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the boldness with which Peter
proclaims the Good News.<br>
      <br>
The thing to remember here is that this is Peter, the one who denied
Jesus three times, the one who fled as Jesus died.&nbsp; This is Peter,
the one who sometimes &#8220;got it&#8221; but could never hold on to it, the one
who mostly got it wrong.&nbsp; And yet, here is Peter empowered by the
Holy Spirit preaching the Good News and becoming, as the book of Acts
reveals, the leader of the early church.<br>
      <br>
Folks, if Jesus and the Holy Spirit can do this to Peter, Jesus and the
Holy Spirit can do this to you and me.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have to be
perfect, but faithful.&nbsp; God will use us to accomplish God&#8217;s
purposes, as we are open to simply following Jesus the best we can.<br>

      <br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading<br>
</h4>The author of First Peter is writing to a group of Christians who
are being persecuted for their faith.&nbsp; The exact nature of that
persecution is unknown to us but it might simply be a situation where
non-Christians revile the Christians for their beliefs.&nbsp; Either
way, the letter is meant to encourage them to hold fast to their
faith.&nbsp; The author reminds them of their baptism into Christ (this
is the reference to &#8220;new birth&#8221; in verse 3) and all the benefits
baptism brings.&nbsp; By clinging to the promises of baptism they will
be able to endure the difficult times and rejoice in their salvation
not only in the future, but even in the midst of their suffering (see
verse 8).<br>
      <br>
While in our country we do not suffer persecution for our faith (though
many Christians around the world do and we should pray for them often),
we do not what it is like to be ridiculed for our faith.&nbsp; Have you
ever prayed out in public with your family, say at a neighborhood
restaurant?&nbsp; If you have you know how some can look at you like
you are some kind of religious nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
If we do live in a post-Christendom world, then this kind of ridicule
will continue to grow.&nbsp; What does it mean to hold on to your faith
in such an environment?&nbsp; Might not we need the council of those
first century ancestors who faced the same thing?&nbsp; Might not the
words of First Peter be directed at us today?&nbsp; I think so.<br>
      <br>
      <h4 class="band">Conclusion</h4>As
the season of Easter unfolds, keep watching those first century
Christians.&nbsp; See how through their doubts, failures, mistakes and
brokenness, they sought to follow Jesus and proclaim the Good
News.&nbsp; We are not so different than they were if we are at all
honest about our struggles to follow Jesus.<br>
