<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 2:14a,22-32</strong>
<p>Luke has described the coming of the Holy Spirit, a divine intervention in the world, as best he can in human terms: it was &#8220;<u>like</u> the rush of a violent wind&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>) and &#8220;divided tongues, <u>as 
of</u> fire&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>). Now Peter, 
on behalf of the other &#8220;eleven&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>) apostles (Matthias has been 
chosen to replace Judas) has begun interpreting the event to them, &#8220;devout Jews from every nation&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>). He has recalled God&#8217;s 
prophecy made through Joel (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A17-21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17-21</a>):
that &#8220;in the last days&#8221; there will be cosmic signs (including &#8220;fire&#8221;),
then &#8220;I [God] will pour out my Spirit&#8221;, and then people will &#8220;prophesy&#8221;
(probably <em>enthusiastically share the faith</em>) and salvation will be offered 
to all &#8220;who [call] ... on the name of the Lord&#8221;. The &#8220;last days&#8221; are the time of the Church 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+1%3A6-8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>Having demonstrated from Joel that the end times are at hand, and
therefore salvation is also at hand, Peter now demonstrates how we have
access to salvation. First he shows that Jesus is the Messiah, from
Psalm <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a> (the quotation in vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A25-28" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">25-28</a>). Jesus, &#8220;a man 
attested ... by God with deeds of power&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>) was turned over by the Jews to 
the Romans to be executed. (And, incidentally, abandoned to his fate by his friends). But God did not &#8220;abandon&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>)
him (permanently) to death. In the resurrection, Peter sees fulfilment
of a prophecy of David that &#8220;your Holy One&#8221; would not experience
corruption (or death). David was not speaking about himself because we
can see &#8220;his tomb&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A29" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">29</a>) today! So he must have been 
speaking of Jesus, who was raised from the dead (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A32" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">32</a>). Therefore, Jesus the Messiah 
gives access to salvation, and the way to be saved is to repent, and be baptised in his name (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>).
Peter's sermon is the crux of the message of Acts: the Spirit has been
poured out to give power to God's people; the end times are here; the
Messiah has appeared; and a message of salvation must be preached so
that those who hear may receive new life in Christ.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 16</strong>
<p>The NRSV translation is significantly different from Peter&#8217;s
quotation in Acts. He quotes the then-current Greek translation loosely
(probably from memory); it takes liberties with the Hebrew original.
Vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16%3A1-2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-2</a> summarize the psalm. The 
speaker probably <em>takes refuge</em> in worship in the Temple; he sees God as <em>supreme good</em> (v.

faithful community, &#8220;the holy ones&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>) as models for living; he will 
not worship with those who choose pagan gods &#8211; and not even associate with them (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>). His fate and his future

author compares his devotion to that of a Levite. For other tribes, there were &#8220;boundary lines&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) between tribal territories in 
Israel, but Levites received no land; the psalmist&#8217;s &#8220;chosen portion&#8221; (v.

&#8220;counsel&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+16%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) and 
deep understanding (&#8220;heart&#8221;). God teaches him his ways. Because God supports him, he will not stumble (&#8220;be moved&#8221;, v.

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<strong>1 Peter 1:3-9</strong>
<p>The author has addressed this letter to those &#8220;chosen and destined&#8221; (v.

by the Father and &#8220;sanctified&#8221; by the Holy Spirit in order &#8220;to be
obedient to Jesus Christ&#8221; and to share in the forgiveness available
through Christ&#8217;s sacrificial death (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>).
(&#8220;Blessed be ...&#8221;, v. 3, is a traditional Jewish prayer form.) The
Father, in his mercy, has caused us to be born again (&#8220;new birth&#8221;,
baptism) into a hope which is very much alive, &#8220;through the
resurrection of Jesus Christ&#8221;. Our rebirth is also into &#8220;an
inheritance&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>):
in the Old Testament, the inheritance was principally Palestine, but
for the Church, it is heavenly. Palestine was lost in war, but our
inheritance is &#8220;imperishable&#8221;, indestructible, free from sin
(&#8220;undefiled&#8221;) and never lost. We, through our trust in God (&#8220;faith&#8221;, v.
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
are guarded by God&#8217;s power &#8211; for &#8220;salvation&#8221; &#8211; already accomplished but
to be shown to all at the end of time (&#8220;last time&#8221;). In all of this (v.
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>),
the readers rejoice even if they have had to suffer &#8220;trials&#8221; (ostracism
or persecution). These verify their faithfulness to God &#8211; as the purity
of gold is tested by heating it. Such fidelity will be rewarded when
Christ comes (to judge) at the end of time (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>). Their faith is such that they 
love him, believe in him and rejoice, even though they (unlike Peter) have never seen him (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+1%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). Why? Because they are aware that 
they are being saved now &#8211; this being a logical and temporal goal of trust in God.</p>

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 20:19-31</strong>
<p>Early on Easter Day, Mary Magdalene has discovered that Jesus&#8217; body
is missing from the tomb; the stone door is open, so it looks as though
someone has stolen it (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+20%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>). She has seen a man standing near 
the tomb. When he speaks to her, she recognizes him as Jesus. She has told the disciples: &#8220;I have seen the Lord&#8221; (v.

<p>Later the same day, Jesus joins the disciples, gathered behind
locked doors. He shows them that he is the one who was crucified (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+20%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">20</a>). Jesus confers on &#8220;the 
disciples&#8221; (not including Thomas, but perhaps a group larger than <em>the ten</em>) &#8220;peace&#8221; (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+20%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>,

&#8220;breathed&#8221; life into Adam, the <em>proto-human</em>,
so Jesus now breathes the new, spiritual, life of recreated humanity
into his followers. Aided by the Spirit, they continue Jesus&#8217; judicial
role in the world, forgiving the sins of the faithful and holding
others blameworthy (&#8220;retain&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+20%3A23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">23</a>) for their actions. Thomas is 
expected to believe without having seen, but he demands: <em>show me the evidence!</em> (v.

intended to help us, who were not witnesses of Jesus&#8217; life, death,
resurrection and ascension to &#8220;come to believe&#8221; and thus &#8220;have life in
his name&#8221;, eternal life.</p>
