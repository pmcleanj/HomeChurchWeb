<B>Isaiah</B>
<P>
This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<STRONG>Psalm 41</STRONG>
<P>Vv.1-3 are a <EM>wise saying</EM>: God protects the downtrodden, even to helping them when they are ill. In ancient times, ill health was thought to be caused by straying from God&#8217;s ways (v.

his foes wonder whether he will die. Lacking a notion of life after death, he thinks he will cease to exist when he dies (&#8220;perish&#8221;, v.

to continue his line.)</P>
<P>When his foes visit him, they make platitudes (&#8220;utter empty words&#8221;, v.

lies on his deathbed. Even a close friend, whom he has helped, has turned against him (v.

God&#8217;s mercy: may he be made well again so he may retaliate (&#8220;repay&#8221;) against his foes. Even though they think he &#8220;will not rise again&#8221; (v.

<B>2 Corinthians</B>
<P>
This is a letter, written in the style common in the first century AD. From the text, 
we know that Paul wrote it in Macedonia after leaving Ephesus, probably in the autumn 
of 57 AD. It gives us a picture of Paul the person: an affectionate man, hurt to the 
quick by misunderstandings and evil-doing of his beloved fellow Christians, yet happy 
when he can praise them. The letter's prime intent is to combat evils which have arisen 
in the Christian communities in the Achaian peninsula of Greece.

<STRONG>2 Corinthians 1:18-22</STRONG>
<P>Paul planned to visit the church at Corinth again, but has not been able to. This has led to a lack of mutual confidence between him and the Christians there. He is eager to restore good relations. He has written: &#8220;we have behaved ... with 
frankness and godly sincerity ... &#8211; all the more toward you&#8221; (v.

Second Coming the Corinthian Christians will &#8220;boast&#8221; (v.

as will he will of their value. Then v.

to them without intending to keep his promise? Was he planning visits &#8220;according to ordinary human standards&#8221;, telling people what they wanted to hear? If they wished an affirmative answer, was he saying &#8220;&#8216;Yes, 
yes&#8217;&#8221;, and if a negative one, &#8220;&#8216;No, no&#8217;&#8221;? Was he intending to deceive, saying <EM>yes</EM> and <EM>no</EM> in the same breath?</P>
<P>Now he says that God, absolutely &#8220;faithful&#8221; (v.

commissioned him were he not completely trustworthy; that he has not indulged in double-talk. Jesus never wavered from complete commitment: &#8220;in him it was always &#8216;Yes&#8217;&#8221; (v.

eternal life, oneness with him. Through Jesus he has kept all of them, i.e. affirmed them. Paul and his companions respond affirmatively. (&#8220;&#8216;Amen&#8217;&#8221;, Hebrew for <EM>so be it</EM>, here is like <EM>yes</EM>.) As for the 
integrity of Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, it is God who has established it and ensures it, having made them one with Christ, made them Christians (&#8220;anointed&#8221;, v.

<B>Mark</B>
<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<STRONG>Mark 2:1-12</STRONG>
<P>After teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum with a new kind of authority and healing people with physical and mental ailments, Jesus has left town, lest he be thought to be a mere wonder-worker. Now he returns to Capernaum; word gets out that he 
is back, probably at Peter&#8217;s house. He tells the many who come to see him about &#8220;the word&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+2%3A2" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>), God&#8217;s purposes to be 
fulfilled through him.</P>
<P>The roof of a Palestinian house could be reached via steps outside. A roof, which was flat, was made of sticks covered with hardened mud. (One might wonder what Peter thought of a hole in his roof!) In Judaism, certain sins could be forgiven by 
God if the sinner was sorry for what he had done, acknowledged the deed, and was resolute in not doing it again, but here Jesus forgives because of the faith of the mat-bearers (and possibly that of the paralytic) (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+2%3A5" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>).</P>
<P>Jesus perceives what the scribes are thinking: only God can forgive sins; Jesus is not God, so he must be a blasphemer (vv. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+2%3A6-8" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">6-8</A>). It is &#8220;easier&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+2%3A9" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>) to say that sins are forgiven 
because no human can tell whether they are or not; only God knows. But only God can heal and he would not use a blasphemer as his agent in healing. If Jesus heals, he is from God; if he does not, he blasphemes. So Jesus shows them that he does 
indeed have &#8220;authority ... to forgive sins&#8221; (v.

alone (vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+2%3A11-12" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">11-12</A>). He is from
