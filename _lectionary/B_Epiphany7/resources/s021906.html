<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Mark 2:1-12

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Giver of Life

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>"I say to you, stand up, take your mat and go to your home."

<P>Questions:
<BR>Now, in addition to the crowds pressing in and the pressure of their expectations and the prospect of their misunderstanding, Jesus encounters resistance because of his ministry.  As long as he was just working wonders, healing the sick and casting out demons, his biggest challenges seemed to be crowd management and clarity about his mission.  Even his closest companions often miss the boat on that one. Now, Jesus claims his power and his authority to forgive sins, and the religious authorities standing by take notice.  After all, it’s their job to make sure people don’t go around blaspheming and making inappropriate claims, breaking the Law. Jesus can read their hearts when they react to his reassurance to the paralyzed man that his sins are forgiven.  Of course, we suspect that his friends – good friends, at that – did not dig a hole in the roof, lift him up on top of the house, and lower him into a crowd so that his sins would be forgiven. The paralyzed man never speaks in this story, and one has to wonder: If Jesus can read the hearts of the scribes, could he not have also read the heart of the man who does not speak?  Perhaps Jesus understood that the man’s deeper need was forgiveness, and being restored to health was an added blessing, however great.

<P>How are the friends of the paralyzed man a model for the church today?  What do you think people long for the most, forgiveness or healing?  In what ways do these two things intersect and overlap?  The man did not walk after being forgiven, so the easy connection between his guilt and his illness probably doesn’t hold up.  But is it easier sometimes to deal with outward realities than with inward ones?  Faith is an important theme in Mark’s Gospel, but it’s not easily defined there, rather, it’s described and brought to life in each story.  What kind of faith did the friends have?  What kind of faith did the paralyzed man have?  What about the scribes?  Was faith a kind of assent to theological claims, or a radical kind of trust, or a wild, reckless hope that digs through roofs and lets a friend down, in the best sense?  Deborah Krause observes that faith in the Gospels seems best exemplified by those on the margins, the periphery, rather than those close to Jesus, as friends or foes.  "Faith, therefore, does not require proximity to Jesus or a firsthand account of his message.  Rather, it requires a posture of trust that in Jesus, his preaching, and his ministry resides the transforming power of God.  In a sense, those with nothing to lose (unlike the rich man in Mark 10:17-22) are able to approach Jesus with the greatest faith" (New Proclamation, Fortress Press, 2005).  In what ways do the friends of the paralyzed man inspire us to overcome obstacles in our ministry to and with one another?  How do they epitomize faith that is more than words and good intentions?  What are the "roofs" that we need to dig through in our society and our world in order to make healing – and forgiveness – a possibility? When have you felt like the scribes?  Do you think they "glorified God" when they saw the man take up his mat, and walk?  How does all of this digging and lowering and forgiving and healing and walking out relate to the reign of God?

<P><B>Isaiah 43:18-25</B>

<P>	Do not remember the former things,
	or consider the things of old.
	I am about to do a new thing;
	now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
	I will make a way in the wilderness
	and rivers in the desert.

<P>	The wild animals will honor me,
	the jackals and the ostriches;
	for I give water in the wilderness,
	rivers in the desert,
	to give drink to my chosen people,
	the people whom I formed for myself
	so that they might declare my praise.

<P>	Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;
	but you have been weary of me, O Israel!
	You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings,
	or honored me with your sacrifices.
	I have not burdened you with offerings,
	or wearied you with frankincense.

<P>	You have not bought me sweet cane with money,
	or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
	But you have burdened me with your sins;
	you have wearied me with your iniquities.
	I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake,
	and I will not remember your sins.

<P><B>Psalm 41</B>

<P>Refrain:
<BR><B>
O set me in your presence forever.
</B>

<P>Happy are those who consider the
<BR>poor;
<BR>God delivers them in the day of
<BR>trouble.

<P>God protects them and keeps them
<BR>alive; they are called happy in the
<BR>land.
<BR>You do not give them up to the
<BR>will of their enemies.

<P>God sustains them on their sickbed;
<BR>in their illness you heal all their
<BR>infirmities.

<P>As for me, I said, "O God, be
<BR>gracious to me;
<BR>heal me, for I have sinned against
<BR>you."

<P>My enemies wonder in malice when I
<BR>will die,
<BR>and when my name will perish.

<P>And when they come to see me, they
<BR>utter empty words, while their hearts
<BR>gather mischief;
<BR>when they go out, they tell it
<BR>abroad.

<P>All who hate me whisper together
<BR>about me; they imagine the worst for
<BR>me.

<P>They think that a deadly thing has
<BR>fastened on me, that I will not rise
<BR>again from where I lie.

<P>Even my friend in whom I trusted,
<BR>who ate of my bread,
<BR>has exalted at my misfortune.

<P>But you, O God, be gracious to me,
<BR>and rise me up, that I may repay
<BR>them.

<P>By this I know that you are pleased
<BR>with me;
<BR>because my enemy has not
<BR>triumphed over me.

<P>But you have upheld me because of
<BR>my integrity,
<BR>and set me in your presence forever.

<P>Blessed be the Sovereign, the God of 
<BR>Israel,
<BR>from everlasting to everlasting.

<P><B>2 Corinthians 1:18-22</B>

<P>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been “Yes and No.” For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not “Yes and No”; but in him it is always “Yes.” For in him every one of God’s promises is a “Yes.” For this reason it is through him that we say the “Amen,” to the glory of God. But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us, by putting his seal on us and giving us his Spirit in our hearts as a first installment.

<P><B>Mark 2:1-12</B>

<P>When he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. So many gathered around that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the door; and he was speaking the word to them. Then some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. And when they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and after having dug through it, they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, “Why does this fellow speak in this way? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 

<P>At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and take your mat and walk’? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—“I say to you, stand up, take your mat and go to your home.” And he stood up, and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

<P>Seventh Sunday after Epiphany
<BR>February 19, 2006
<BR>Mark 2:1-12

<P>"THAT THEY MAY ALL BE ONE" (John 17:21)

<P>   The First Congregational Church  in Las Vegas, Nevada, was founded by European Americans in 1931, about the same time that construction began on nearby Hoover Dam. In 1999, the church building, on North Eastern Avenue, far from the glitter of the "Strip," became  the home, too, of the Samoan Congregational Christian Church. In addition, the church now plays host to Hispanic and Roma (Gypsy) congregations.
<P>    Our diversity in Las Vegas, and many, many other communities, reflects the emerging identity of the United Church of Christ laity and clergy today. Even before the 1993 General Synod pronouncement, "Becoming a Multicultural and Multiracial Church," the UCC was moving toward greater and more intentional inclusiveness. The General Synod action helped make sure that all settings of the church responded to this prophetic calling.  
<P>    Knowing the UCC, inclusiveness has never meant uniformity or homogeneity. In a melting pot, to be sure, all of the diverse constituents lose their separate identities. But in a tossed salad like the UCC, each of the ingredients retains its integrity, while all are enhanced by being mixed together.
<P>    Knowing the UCC, diversity has never been a fixed concept. As we have listened attentively to the spirit of our still-speaking God, definitions of multiculturalism and multiracialism have expanded dynamically to embrace more and more people.   
<P>    Where, due to demographics,  multiculturalism and multiracialism cannot fully enrich the life of a local church, they can be and are experienced in UCC association and Conference settings. That is just one of the priceless gifts of our connectedness in Christ. Thanks be to God!

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
