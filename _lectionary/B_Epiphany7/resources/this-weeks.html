<h2>On Behalf of Others </h2>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety   is running high these days.&nbsp; People who have been struggling in   depression and grief are feeling weighed down.&nbsp; I was talking with   a woman the other day that lost her husband 3 years ago.&nbsp; She survived   the Holidays but barely.&nbsp; They are always harder than she thinks   they will be and the hardest place for her to be is at worship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   might like to think that the most comforting place for a person to be   would be at worship where the Good News of a Gracious God flows from   Font, Pulpit and Table.&nbsp; The Good News is sure and certain, but   I am increasingly aware of how hard it can be to hear.&nbsp; Anxiety,   grief, illness, and depression can make &ldquo;going to church&rdquo; very difficult.&nbsp;   There are times when we lack the words to pray or the voices to sing.&nbsp;   Our ears are stopped by the reality of suffering and pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   pray that people who experience times when they can&rsquo;t pray, sing or   hear will find a welcome in our congregations.&nbsp; I pray that they   will be surrounded by their sisters and brothers in Christ who will   pray boldly, sing heartily and enflesh the promises of God for them   on their behalf.&nbsp; I pray that the blessings of the liturgy will   offer them both text and tune when they cannot find their own.&nbsp;   I pray that buoyed on the love of the community they will know again   the God who suffers for them and the Savior whose gifts of forgiveness   and healing is offered for all &ndash; especially the ill, the grieving   and those who cannot find their voice.</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Lesson </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This   is a passage of Divine speech addressed to the exiles.&nbsp; God is   speaking.&nbsp; Thankfully God is patient and forgetful.&nbsp; This   text is full of rich imagery of new life &ndash; the new thing that God   is doing.&nbsp; Rivers will flow in the dessert and wild animals will   pay homage.&nbsp; We see that there has been divine suffering on behalf   of a sinful and faithless people (vs. 24).&nbsp; Although created to   declare God&rsquo;s praise, Israel has ignored and offended God.&nbsp; Yet   again God proclaims, &ldquo;I, I am He who blots out your transgression&hellip;and   I will not remember your sins.&rdquo;</p>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Lesson </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once   again, Paul finds himself under attack.&nbsp; He is being criticized   for speaking out of both sides of his mouth &ndash; for saying yes and no   &ndash; for vacillating- for relativism.&nbsp; Paul moves his argument and   defense into a theological discourse as he assures the people of God&rsquo;s   faithfulness (regardless of what you think of Paul&rsquo;s faithfulness).&nbsp;   He also then turns the criticism of saying yes and no into an unlikely   image of Christ &ndash; as God&rsquo;s Yes for us.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It   is worth noting that the chapter begins with references to Paul&rsquo;s   suffering &ldquo;afflictions&rdquo; for the sake of the consolation of others.&nbsp;   This text can be found in the opening dialogue of the funeral liturgy   in the LBW (pg. 206).&nbsp; The greater reference is then of course   to the sufferings of Jesus.&nbsp; &ldquo;For just as the sufferings of Christ   are abundant for us, so also our consolation is abundant through Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;   Any suffering, affliction or consolation on the part of Paul or Christ   is for the sake of and on behalf of others.</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This   text is a story that makes for high drama.&nbsp; The crowds are clamoring   to see and hear this man Jesus.&nbsp; Those coming to him are desperate,   persistent and clinging to the belief that he can heal.&nbsp; The conflict   with the religious leaders of the day is on the rise.&nbsp; They are   increasingly separated from Jesus and the people who follow him.&nbsp;   It is the Religious ones who are troubled by the implications of the   healing and the followers are simply overcome by hope in the power of   Jesus.&nbsp;<br />
</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus   breaks down that which separates people from God, and one another.&nbsp;   He does not let sin or severe afflictions stand in the way of communion   with God and neighbor.&nbsp; The religious ones, in this case the scribes,   assume that they are righteous and that they know the conditions under   which a person can expect and have access to the mercy of God. Jesus   demonstrates that God&rsquo;s love knows no bounds.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My   present preaching and teaching interest in this text falls around the   fact that Jesus responds to the faith that the friends demonstrate on   behalf of the paralytic and that sometimes entire structures need to   be altered for the sake of healing.&nbsp; The scribes are unable and   perhaps unwilling to see that Jesus is altering the structures of the   day for the sake of healing.&nbsp; The perceived threat or risk to those   in power and most invested in structures (physical or otherwise) overshadows   the desire for healing and forgiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The   religious leaders of the day fail to lead and they fail to follow.&nbsp;   It is the crowd who responds appropriately in praising God as they have   been created to do.&nbsp; It is the crowd who follows Jesus.&nbsp; What   we do and don&rsquo;t do on behalf of others has significant consequences.&nbsp;   Are we afraid of risks or freed by hope?</p>
<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.Do you know someone or can you remember a time yourself when suffering has silenced you in worship?</p>
<p>2.When have you been carried by the faith of the community?  When have you helped to carry another?</p>
<p>3.Look through several translations of the Bible and see the different words used in 2 Cor.1:18.  NRSV translates “God is faithful” what other words are used?  Loyal?  Do they give different insights into the meaning of the verse?</p>
<p>4. What physical or systemic structures do you observe that stand in the way of healing and forgiveness?</p>
