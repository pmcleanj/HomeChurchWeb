				<P><FONT SIZE=2><!--StartFragment --><SUP>1</SUP>A few days
				later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that
				he had come home. <SUP>2</SUP>So many gathered that there was no
				room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to
				them. <SUP>3</SUP>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic,
				carried by four of them. <SUP>4</SUP>Since they could not get him
				to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof
				above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the
				paralyzed man was lying on. </FONT>

				<P><FONT SIZE=2><SUP>5</SUP>When Jesus saw their faith, he said
				to the paralytic, &quot;Son, your sins are forgiven.&quot; <BR><SUP>6</SUP>Now
				some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to
				themselves, <SUP>7</SUP>&quot;Why does this fellow talk like
				that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;
				<BR><SUP>8</SUP>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this
				was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them,
				&quot;Why are you thinking these things?<!--EndFragment--> </FONT>

				<P><FONT SIZE=2><SUP>9</SUP>Which is easier: to say to the
				paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take
				your mat and walk'? <SUP>10</SUP>But that you may know that the
				Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . .&quot;
				He said to the paralytic, <SUP>11</SUP>&quot;I tell you, get up,
				take your mat and go home.&quot; <SUP>12</SUP>He got up, took his
				mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone
				and they praised God, saying, &quot;We have never seen anything
				like this!&quot;</FONT></P>
