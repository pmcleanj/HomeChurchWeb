the right date. Reminder that &quot;Epiphany&quot; means &quot;Discovery&quot;
-- in this case the discovery of who Jesus is. Review our memory
scripture:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son
of God: as it is written in the Prophets, <BR>Behold I send my
messenger before thy face, <BR>Which shall prepare thy way before
thee. <BR>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, <BR>Prepare ye
the way of the Lord <BR>Make his paths straight. <BR>John did baptize
in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the
forgiveness of sins. And there went out unto him all the land of
Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the
river of Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed with
camel's hair, and with a girdle of skin about his loins; and he did
eat locusts and wild honey; and preached, saying, There cometh one
mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have baptized you with water: but
he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit. And it came to pass in
those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was
baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the
water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove
descending upon him: and there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou
art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Choose the biggest person
and littlest person in the class. Ask the littlest person to lift the
big one. In turn, let the little people try to lift the biggest
person. If that person needed help and couldn't go get it herself,
how would we get her to help, if none of us can carry her? Have her
sit or lie on a sturdy rug. Let everyone grab a corner or side of the
rug. Can we move her that way, if there are enough of us? Remember
from last week, that when we are weak, we need the support of a
community. A community becomes stronger when it accepts people, and
becomes weaker when it rejects people. All of us working together
could help get our friend to the help she needed.</P>

is like Home-work, except that it is done in the pews, instead of
being done at home. Because it is focussed on the readings (as the
sermon, presumably, also is) it can be done during the sermon to help
the listener concentrate. Or, it can be done while waiting for
everyone else to finish their communion. It isn't done during
prayers, or hymns, or the readings, because</FONT></P>
