</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This is a short story set in
the period before 1000 BC, when warlords ruled Israel: they raised a
militia in time of need, and stayed on to settle disputes in the
community. It is a book about love and fidelity, of how Ruth, a
Moabite widow in a Jewish family brings her widowed mother-in-law
back to enjoying life. Near the end of the book, Ruth bears a son who
becomes David's grandfather. This carries a message: marrying
foreigners is acceptable. When it was written is uncertain, but this
message gives us a clue: at various times, pagans were blamed for
Israel's sorry state of morals. Pagans came to Israel through
intermarriage, so marrying non-Israelites was, at least, opposed.
This occurred twice: during the time of Josiah and Jeremiah (about
600 BC) and of Nehemiah (about 450 BC). </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This story is set &ldquo;in the
days when the judges ruled&rdquo;. Before the institution of the
monarchy, &ldquo;judges&rdquo;, wise people, arbitrated disputes,
ruled the land, and raised a militia to defend it. Because of a
&ldquo;famine&rdquo; in Judah, &ldquo;Elimelech&rdquo; (v. 2) and his
family migrate to Moab, the high well-watered plateau to the east of
the Dead Sea. (&ldquo;Ephrathites&rdquo; were people in the Bethlehem
area.) Elimelech dies (v. 3).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>The two sons marry local girls,
but then die (v. 5), so now there are three widows. In this
patriarchal culture, they are powerless, destitute. News reaches them
that the famine is over (v. 6), so they set out to return to Judah
(v. 7). But then Naomi suggests that they &ldquo;go back ... to your
mother&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (v. 8). (Note how often &ldquo;go back&rdquo;
and &ldquo;return&rdquo; occur in our reading.) Usually a widow
returned to her <U>father&rsquo;s</U> house; perhaps the author
emphasizes the absence of men in the women&rsquo;s lives.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Naomi acknowledges the
steadfast loyalty of the two young widows to her and her sons, and
prays that God will stand by them in the future. May they marry
again; may they find permanent &ldquo;security&rdquo;, (v. 9, true
fulfilment), in the houses of their new husbands. She releases them
from any sense of obligation to her sons. But they express their
loyalty to her (v. 10).</FONT></FONT></P>

to marry Orpah and Ruth. She is neither pregnant (v. 11) nor likely
to remarry (v. 12). Even if a miracle occurs, would they wait for the
sons to grow up? God is the source of her suffering (v. 13). (Their
decision to stay with her has made, in her mind, &ldquo;the LORD&rdquo;,
her Lord, theirs.) In departing, Orpah kisses, blesses, Naomi. But
Ruth remains constant (v. 15): she is totally committed, for life, to
accepting God as her god (vv. 16-17). V. 17b is part of a sworn oath:
Ruth invites God&rsquo;s wrath if she fails in her commitment to
Naomi. The decision is made: Ruth will accompany Naomi to Judah.
Naomi places the welfare of Orpah and Ruth above that of her sons.
Sons born to a man&rsquo;s widow, conceived through a kinsman, were
considered his heirs; in this way, he continued to exist in Israel.

from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile
(about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments,
thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the

throughout his life. We should not look to human leaders for security

leaders rather than kings.) But God is to be trusted for he is
creator, and maintains his pact with us forever; he is the guardian

Shema</FONT></FONT></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
verses of this passage sum up the crisis in which the Deuteronomy
first appeared (about 900 B.C. during the reign of the kings in
Israel and Judah). Faith in the God of Israel was challenged by the
practices of fertility gods. Originally popular in the rural area,
worship of these gods found its way into the city, especially among
the ruling class.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Other
issues faced the nation that were reflected in the pages of
Deuteronomy. Economic power began to shift from the country side to
the cities. Urban money lenders charged exorbitant rates to farmers
and claimed the land of delinquent debtors. Debtors sold themselves
into slavery so they could buy food to feed their families. In
addition, political power became corrupt. Judges took bribes and
showed favors to the wealthy. Economically and politically, the gap
widened between the rich and the poor.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Deuteronomy
appeared to reform these injustices. It reaffirmed the Ten
Commandments with the power of a God's personal revelation
(Deuteronomy 5). In the midst of fear from God's power and the
blessing of God's promise, Moses proclaimed these famous lines: love
God with your being and life. These words summarized the covenant
allegiance God had with his chosen. This allegiance defined the
identity of the Israelite.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Apart from the concluding
verses (which may have been added later), this book is a treatise (or
sermon) rather than a letter. Its name comes from its approach to
Christianity: it is couched is Judaic terms. The identity of the
author is unknown; Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only God knows&quot;
who wrote Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, arguing
for the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as revealer and
mediator of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old Testament,
the author argues for the superiority of Christ to the prophets,
angels and Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his
sacrifice is much more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus
is the &quot;heavenly&quot; High Priest, making the true sacrifice
for the sins of the people, but he is also of the same flesh and
blood as those he makes holy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">Hebrews 9:11-14</FONT></FONT></STRONG><FONT COLOR="#993366">
</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Vv. 1-7 tell of temple practice
in ancient Israel. The forerunner of the Temple was a &ldquo;tent&rdquo;
(v. 2), called the &ldquo;Holy Place&rdquo;. Within this &ldquo;tent&rdquo;
was a second one, called the &ldquo;Holy of Holies&rdquo; (v. 3),
where God dwelt. On the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), only the high
priest went into &ldquo;the second&rdquo; tent (v. 7), to offer a
sacrifice of animal blood for the redemption of unintentional sins.
Annual repetition of this ritual shows that redemption from sin was
of limited duration; that there were two tents shows that sacrifices
could not remove the inner guilt (&ldquo;perfect the conscience&rdquo;,
v. 9) of the faithful.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">In somewhat like manner, when
Christ came the first time, to redeem us of our sin, he passed
through his risen body (the equivalent of the outer tent) into &ldquo;the
Holy Place&rdquo; (v. 12, which must be the Holy of Holies, i.e.
heaven). The blood in his saving act was his own (in crucifixion),
not animal blood; therefore the redemption it achieved is forever. In
the Temple, &ldquo;ashes of a heifer&rdquo; (v. 13) were mixed with
water and used to </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">purify
the flesh</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">, i.e.
restore the ritual purity, of those who had touched the dead. If the
high priest was able to achieve this, how much greater will be the
effect of Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;blood&rdquo; (v. 14), his sacrifice of
his sinless self, in removing all traces of guilt for our past
ungodly (&ldquo;dead&rdquo;) deeds enabling us to &ldquo;worship the
living God&rdquo;. (His &ldquo;eternal Spirit&rdquo; is probably his
spirit of self-offering.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>From http://www.word-sunday.com</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2><B>These few verses acted as a
conclusion to the arguments the author made for Jesus as High Priest.
He based his insight on Psalm 110:4: &ldquo;The Lord has sworn and
will not change his mind, &lsquo;You are a priest for ever after the
order of Melchizedek.&rsquo;&rdquo; (RSV) To flesh out his
interpretation of this Psalm, he began with a study on the person of
Melchizedek in Genesis 14:17-20.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Melchizedek
was the king-priest of the Most High. He was not listed with
parentage or descendants in Scripture. He offered sacrifice on behalf
of Abram (later Abraham), who, in turn gave him a tithe. For the
author, Melchizedek represented the eternal worship of the living God
(the king-priest did not have a genealogy). Through the intercession
of such worship, Abram would receive the blessing of God&rsquo;s
covenant. In return, Abram gave the leader of the eternal worship his
due (a tithe). In this sense, Melchizedek was a symbol of the eternal
worship offered to God in heaven. (Hebrews 7:1-10)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Scholars
call a symbol like Melchizedek an &ldquo;archtype;&rdquo; for
interpreters like the author of Hebrews, such an archtype would be
the key to understanding the question of Hebrew priesthood.
Melchizedek was found in the book of Genesis, which was, both by
traditional chronology and by the order of the canon, before the
appearance of the priesthood of Aaron (in Exodus). Because of its
place of importance and its eternal status, the priesthood of
Melchizedek was the measure of Aaron&rsquo;s priesthood. The
Levitical priesthood which descended from Aaron was human (as it was
passed from father to son) and, so, had all the frailties of human
nature. In light of the &ldquo;order of Melchizedek,&rdquo; the
Levites would always turn out second best.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
author then separated the two priesthoods, as distinct. (Hebrews
7:11-14) One was human, based upon the Law which could regulate, but
could not perfect humanity. The other was based upon God&rsquo;s
direct oath (found in Psalm 110:4) toward a Son. This Son would be
perfected, since his priesthood was different from that of Aaron&rsquo;s
descendants. And since he would stand forever in worship. The result
would be a new covenant between God and people. (Hebrews 7:15-22)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>With
this background, we can now address the verses in this reading. The
author implied the chief impediment to the Levitical priesthood was
death itself. Christ, who was THE priest in the order of Melchizedek,
overcame death. So, he could not pass on his status. Those who
approached God through his intercession could do so in fullest
confidence.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition, Christ had no sin. He could succeed where the other high
priests had failed. The author implied this was the reason Christ
could overcome death. In the minds of his contemporaries, sin led to
death. Only the One without sin could conquer death and fulfill the
promise of Psalm 110:4. He did so in his self-offering death. While
this might seem a contradiction, bring to mind the image of the
Suffering Servant from Isaiah. The sinless Servant who suffered and
died for the sins of others would see life again. His death led to
new life. In this way, the Son was perfected; in this sense,
perfection meant status. Christ acted as High Priest directly before
the throne of God in heaven. No one had a high status than he had.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
book of Hebrews gives us much to think about. For much of our faith
was contained in these compressed verses. The priesthood of
Melchizedek was not one of ritual, but one of self-giving death. We
join with Christ&rsquo;s priesthood when we die to self for the sake
of others. In this way, we join our worship with his in heaven. We
must remember that self-giving is the essence of Christian worship.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>(&ldquo;Hear, ...&rdquo;, v. 29), recited twice daily by
pious Jews. He links a second to the first: love your neighbour,
whoever he is, as you do yourself (v. 31). Jesus combines these two
precepts into a moral principle, linked by love. The scribe agrees
and elaborates (vv. 32-33): there being only one God, we should love
him undividedly, with all our faculties. Both precepts are &ldquo;much
more important&rdquo; than temple-based religion. Jesus tells him
that he is now almost ready for the coming kingdom of God.</FONT></FONT></P>

gospel narrative was one of the few times Jesus and the Pharisees
would agree. They looked at the Torah through the same lens, unlike
the Sadducees or the Herodians who had different priorities. Jesus
and his opponents, the Pharisees, used the principle of love (i.e.,
fidelity) as a yardstick to measure religious practice.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

After he had heard them disputing, having seen that HE answered them
well, one of the scribes, having approached (HIM), asked HIM, &quot;What
sort of commandment is first of all?&quot; 29 JESUS answered, &quot;First
is: 'Hear Israel, the Lord (is)our God; the Lord is one. 30 You will
love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul,' all your
mind, 'and all your strength.'&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

This would be a very confusing sentence in English due to the lack of
case endings in the English language. To make sense in English,
participial phrases were rearranged.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;What
sort of commandment is first of all?&quot; The word &quot;first&quot;
meant more than the &quot;first in order&quot; or the &quot;most
important.&quot; The word &quot;first&quot; (&quot;protos&quot; in
Greek) also meant &quot;guiding principle.&quot; The &quot;first&quot;
commandment would provide the key that would unlock the religious
philosophy of Jesus, how he envisioned the relationship of people
with God.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:29
&quot;Hear Israel, the Lord (is)our God; the Lord is one.&quot; This
phrase, taken from Deuteronomy 6:4, is known as the Shema (from the
imperative &quot;hear!&quot; in Hebrew). This phrase and the command
to love God together form THE defining phrase for the Jew. This
phrase signifies a Jew as much as the Sign of the Cross signifies the
Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Christian.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
phrase itself could be translated in two ways. First, the phrase
could be translated in the narrow sense of Jewish allegiance to a
particular God: YHWH. (Please note that the word &quot;Lord&quot;
replaced YHWH in Hebrew, out of deference to the Second Commandment.)
In this sense, the phrase could be translated: &quot;Hear, Israel!
YHWH is our only God.&quot; In the time of the kings, Israelites did
not question the existence of other gods from other nations. But,
their God was the only one that matter. No doubt, this was the
original sense of the phrase, when Israelite lived among many
polytheistic peoples.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>However,
by the time Jesus preached, the phrase had a much broader
interpretation. In the first century AD, Judaism was strictly
monotheistic. No other gods existed but YHWH. In this sense, the
phrase could be translated &quot;Hear Israel! YHWH is our God. YHWH
is the only (God).&quot; The translation above reflects the broader,
monotheistic interpretation than that of simple national, allegiance.
(See 12:32).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:30
&quot;'all your heart, . . . ' all your mind . . . &quot; The phrase
&quot;all your mind&quot; was an addition Jesus made to Deu. 6:5.
Since ancients believed the heart was the center of thoughts and
emotions, the second phrase &quot;all your mind&quot; was redundant.
Possibly this &quot;doublet&quot; reflected Jesus' emphasis on the
interior intent; what came from the heart was more important than
strict adherence to the Torah.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
scribe asked Jesus a question about importance in the Law. And Jesus
gave a straightforward answer. Obviously, an answer about the Law
should come from the Law. So Jesus quoted Scripture.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
question of importance, as the note stated above, was one of guiding
principle. Through this one command, one could create a hierarchy
with the other commands, give direction to their enforcement, and a
symbol that encompassed the meaning of Judaism.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Even
in the time of Jesus, rabbis realized that some commands in the Torah
carried more weight than others. After all, gleaning wheat germ on
the Sabbath was not as important as a prohibition against adultery.
And, the Ten Commandments themselves were written in order of
importance.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Beyond
the question of hierarchy, however, came the question of justice and
mercy. How should a judge enforce these commands when circumstances
pulled at the question in different directions?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Finally
came the question of social expression. How do these commands
proclaim YHWH among the nations, as well as unite the community of
believers? What command could the faithful use to show they were
Jews?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus
answered the first part of that question with the Shema, Deuteronomy
6:4-5. Love God with all your being. Love in this sense was not an
inner emotion or psychological state alone. In the time and culture
of Jesus, love meant allegiance. As God made a covenant with his
people (a formal allegiance between a king and his subjects), he
demanded a response. A commitment and a faithful life to that
allegiance (i.e., covenant) was the only answer. Notice that the
command was pointed at the nation and the individual. God wanted
faithful individuals to form a faithful community. The individual was
to take ownership of his or her response and take responsibility for
the type of community he or she lived in. Taking both types of
ownership was implicit in the command: &quot;Love God.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>31
&quot;The second (is) this: 'You will love your neighbor as
yourself.' There is not another commandment greater than these.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:31
&quot;You will love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Jesus quoted
Leviticus 19:18 for this command. Leviticus 19 is known as the
Holiness Codes, for the name of YHWH is invoked more times in this
chapter than any other place in the Torah. A closer view of this
chapter revealed a symmetric pattern for the use of the name. Since
Leviticus 19:18 lay at the very center of this pattern, this command
stood out in rabbinical thought as the pinnacle of God's commands in
Leviticus.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
term &quot;neighbor&quot; meant &quot;fellow countryman.&quot; In the
thought of Jesus' contemporaries, charity may extend to the alien,
but love was reserved for the fellow Jew. Of course, Luke 10:22-37
(the story of the Good Samaritan) included everyone in the command.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus
backed up the Shema with another important verse: love of neighbor.
This meant allegiance to one's community. Of course, different groups
could interpret this phrase in different ways.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>What
did love for one's neighbor mean to the followers of the Nazarene?
For the evangelizing Christians, love meant a certain openness to the
stranger, the outcast, and the sinner. For many Christians had found
themselves with those titles in the past. In addition, it meant
caring for those who had no one else to care for them: widows and
orphans. Finally, it meant a code of conduct that showed the utmost
fidelity to community itself. They clung to each other for survival,
for strength, and for growth. After all, this was what was meant by
the phrase: &quot;Christians! See how they love one another!&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Christianity
was built on charity, caring for others regardless for their
background. Charity embodied the Christian interpretation of
Leviticus 19:18.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>32
The scribe said to HIM, &quot;Well (done), TEACHER. Truly you spoke
(he) is one and there is no other except him, 33 and to love him with
your whole heart, with your whole understanding, and with all your
strength, and to love (one's) neighbor as (one's) self is much more
(than) of all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot; 34
JESUS, seeing that he answered wisely, said to him, &quot;You are not
far from the Kingdom of God.&quot;</B> <B>No one dared to ask him
(anything) any longer.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:32
&quot;(he) is one and there is no other except him&quot; combined
Deu. 6:4 (He is one) with Deu. 4:35 (there is no other except him).
This combination of verses supported a strict monotheism among the
Jews, common at the time of Jesus.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:33
&quot;much more (than) of all the whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices&quot; The scribe asserted a central tenant of Pharisees:
obedience to these two commands in the Law was greater than the
worship system of the Temple. In this case, the Christians sided with
the Pharisees against the Sadducees, the Temple elite and city
fathers in Jerusalem.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:34
&quot;You are not far from the Kingdom of God.&quot; Jesus indicated
the scribe was ready to hear the Good News and become a follower.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
scribe responded to Jesus' answer with enthusiasm. Yes, the Law could
be summed up with a strict monotheism and a strict fidelity to the
community. These two commands meant more than any worship in the
Temple. But beyond this agreement lay disagreements on means? How do
you love God and neighbor? For the Christian, the answer could be
found in a relationship with Jesus. He was the means to the Father.
He was the brother that could be found in the face of other people.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Agreement
on these two guiding commands and their shared quality of allegiance
became the starting point for proclaiming the Good News. Yes, one
could live his or her life trying to love God and neighbor, but there
was a better way. Believe in the One who had lived the commandment
perfectly. Believe in the One who could help the faithful along the
way.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Christianity
has always used the &quot;Great Commandment&quot; as a lens to view
the Ten Commandments. The first three commandments fulfill love of

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>But,

first in our life? Is it us or Jesus? If the answer is us, we're on
