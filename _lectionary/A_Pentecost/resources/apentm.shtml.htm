<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<em>Note: Acts 2:1-21 must be read.</em>
<hr>
<strong>Acts 2:1-21</strong>
<p>The day of Pentecost has come; it is now fifty days since Easter.
The way Luke puts it shows that Pentecost is a milestone in the story
of salvation: recall Luke <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+2%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2:6</a>, &#8220;the time came for her to 
deliver her child ...&#8221; and Luke 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+9%3A51" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9:51</a>, &#8220;When the days drew near 
for him to be taken up ...&#8221; These too are milestones, and the language is similar. Other translations have <em>was fulfilled</em> for &#8220;had come&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1</a>) &#8211; the coming of the Holy 
Spirit is <em>fulfilment</em>. Look at the manner in which the Holy Spirit comes: the sound is &#8220;<u>like</u> the rush of a violent wind&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>); and then, &#8220;divided tongues, 
<u>as of</u> fire&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>).
Luke attempts to describe the event in human terms, but it is never
possible to explain a divine mystery: all we can do is say what it is
like. The coming of the Holy Spirit is the gift inaugurating the final
stage of the salvation story (or history, chronology); this era leads
up to the end of time. His arrival is in fulfilment of Christ's
promise, recorded in <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+1%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1:8</a>.</p>
<p>Acts is about mission, about speaking, proclaiming, the good news to
people everywhere, in languages (and language) they can understand;
Luke tells us that the Holy Spirit is the driving force behind this
work, e.g. in the story of the Ethiopian Eunuch, we read &#8220;the Spirit
said to Philip ...&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+8%3A29" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8:29</a>). They spoke &#8220;in other 
languages, as the Spirit gave them ability&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>). Divided into nations in antiquity, 
now all humanity is one; now God is in our midst. The Spirit is the launching pad for this mission. The list in vv.

of the known world. The mission to Gentiles will begin later. &#8220;God's deeds of power&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>), of which all spoke, are 
explained by Peter in vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A14-36" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14-36</a>, 
based on a quotation from the book of Joel (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A17-18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17-18</a>): as the end of the era in 
which we are living approaches, many people will prophesy, and many will &#8220;see&#8221; things beyond what we call <em>concrete reality</em>. And this will happen because God pours out the Holy Spirit. <em>Prophecy</em> here is probably 
<em>enthusiastically sharing the faith</em>, &#8220;speaking about God's deeds of power&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>). The &#8220;portents&#8221; (v.

the era) are expressed in terms of <em>primitive science</em> but we need to realize that things will happen which make no sense to our rational minds, things we cannot explain.</p>

<b>Numbers</b>
</small><p>
<small>Numbers begins with the first census of Israel, and is named for it. After
several chapter containing laws, the narrative section begins in Chapter 9. It
follows the people of Israel from near the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula
to Moab, east of Palestine, over a period of 38 years. Numbers is not a
history in the modern sense but rather a record of how God acted in history:
as an indicator of how he would act again on behalf of his people.

<strong>Numbers 11:24-30</strong>
<p>The people of Israel have left Sinai, and are out in the desert.
People on the fringe of the community are complaining to Moses about
the diet: manna may be God-given, but it gets monotonous; they remember
fondly the meat, fish and vegetables they enjoyed in Egypt (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). They 
want meat to eat. The rebellion spreads amongst the clans (v.

making him the foster-father (&#8220;as a nurse carries a sucking child&#8221;, v.

He asks: &#8220;Where am I to get meat to give to all this people?&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>) I can't do it alone; the 
burden is too heavy (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>). I 
would rather die than continue in this misery. God answers: delegate! &#8220;Gather ... seventy of the elders&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>). God will take &#8220;some of 
the spirit that is on ... [Moses] and put it on them&#8221; (v.

thus sharing authority under God.</p>
<p>When Moses has told the people of his conversation with God, that
God will provide sufficient meat for all, he gathers the &#8220;seventy&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>) around the Tent of Meeting, 
the place of worship at the edge of the camp. Now God intervenes in human affairs. (The &#8220;cloud&#8221;, v.

symbolizes his presence.) When God&#8217;s spirit comes upon the &#8220;seventy&#8221; (a
number, indicating perfection and completion), they enter a trance-like
state; they prophesy. But then they are silent. Then two men, &#8220;Eldad
and ... Medad&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26</a>, possibly meaning <em>beloved 
of God</em>),
genuine people of Israel (&#8220;registered&#8221;), not invited to the Tent,
prophesy. Joshua seeks to have them stopped, because they have not
received authority, but Moses asks Joshua whether he thinks the
activities of other prophets will diminish his charisma (&#8220;Are you
jealous for my sake?&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Numbers+11%3A29" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">29</a>). Moses implies that their 
prophecy is genuine. In the following verses, we learn that the &#8220;meat&#8221; (v.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 104:24-34,35b</strong>
<p>This psalm is a hymn of praise to God, as creator. Earlier verses
have praised him for creating the heavens and the earth, for overcoming
chaos, for continuing to care for the earth and all who live in it.
God&#8217;s marvellous &#8220;works&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+104%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>) are

<b>1 Corinthians</b> 
</small><p>
<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<strong>1 Corinthians 12:3b-13</strong>
<p>Early in this letter, Paul has noted that the Christians at Corinth &#8220;are not lacking in any spiritual gift&#8221;

it seems that there are questions in the community. One gift is
inspired speech. The tests for whether one speaks under the influence

<p> &#8220;Wisdom&#8221; and &#8220;knowledge&#8221; seem to be the ability to instruct;
&#8220;faith&#8221; seems to be exceptionally deep faith &#8211; that God can do
anything. &#8220;Discernment&#8221; is the ability to tell whether gifts genuinely
come from God. &#8220;Tongues&#8221; may be unintelligible speech which needs
&#8220;interpretation&#8221;. Each of us receives a gift (perhaps not one listed);
God chooses, not us.

<strong>John 20:19-23</strong>
<p>Early on Easter Day, Mary Magdalene has discovered that Jesus&#8217; body
is missing from the tomb. There is a man standing nearby, whom she
assumes is the gardener. When he speaks to her, she recognizes him as
Jesus. She has told the disciples: &#8220;I have seen the Lord&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+20%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus now appears to his disciples in his <em>resurrection body</em>:
he bears the marks of his crucifixion, yet can pass through doors; he
is truly alive. Earlier, he has said &#8220;[my] peace I leave with you&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+14%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14:27</a>). As he has been sent into 
the world with the Father&#8217;s authority, so he now sends out the disciples (and the Church) to continue his work (v.

Jesus&#8217; exaltation, his appearances and the giving of the Holy Spirit are <em>one event</em>. Conversion and baptism involve <em>forgiveness of sins</em>; those who reject the good news are not forgiven (&#8220;retained&#8221;, v.

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in

<strong>John 7:37-39</strong>
<p>Each day during the &#8220;festival&#8221; of Booths (Tabernacles), water has
been carried from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple, as a reminder of
the water which sprang forth from the rock in the wilderness. Jesus now
reinterprets the water: he is the &#8220;living water&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+7%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>); he relieves the thirst of the 
believer. &#8220;The believer&#8217;s heart&#8221; is literally <em>his belly</em>, his very being. But <em>his</em> is ambiguous: the NRSV chose <em>the believer</em> as the antecedent, but <em>Jesus</em> is also possible. John explains (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+7%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>):
the living water (&#8220;this&#8221;) is &#8220;the Spirit&#8221;. &#8220;As yet there was no Spirit&#8221;
caused theological difficulties for early interpreters and translators;
some appended <em>given</em>.
(The text as we have it appears to be original.) The Holy Spirit,
existing since before time (as stated elsewhere in the book), will come
to believers when Jesus has died, risen and ascended (&#8220;glorified&#8221;).
They will receive the Spirit, and make it available to others. (The
quotation is not in the Old Testament.)</p>
