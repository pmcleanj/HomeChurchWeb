<p class="versetxt"><b>1 Corinthians 12:3b-7, 12-13</b></p>
</div>
<h4>Spiritual Gifts</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>3b No can say "Lord Jesus" unless he lives in the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>4 While there are many kinds of gifts from
God, we all share the same Spirit. 5 While there are different ways to
serve others, we all share the same Lord. While we might do different
jobs in the community, we all share the same God who does all these
things in everyone. 7 God gave each of us a way to show the Spirit for
everyone's good.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>12 Think of a body. It has many different
parts, but it is still a single body. It is the same way in our
relationship with Christ. 13 Because of God's Spirit, we were all
baptized into one body, no matter who we are or what we have. And we
all drank from the same Spirit.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>3b No one is able to say "Lord Jesus" except in the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>4 There are differing (types) of (graced) gifts,
but there is the same Spirit. 5 There are differing (types) of service,
and the same Lord. 6 There are differing (ways of) work, but the same
God working all of them in everyone. 7 To each is given a manifestation
of the Spirit toward the profit (of all).</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>12 For just as the body is one, and it has many
members, all the members of the body, being many, are one, thus (it is)
also (with) Christ. 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one
body, whether Jew or Greek, slave or free, and all were made to drink
of one Spirit.</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Unity and diversity. Think of the multi-cultural
culture we now live in. Not only are we racially and ethnically mixed,
we also have many expressions of tradition and language. In the past,
such differences would have been kept separated in the ghetto for two
generations until there was cultural assimilation. But, with the many
media avenues for news, our differences are much more apparent, even
threatening.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The image of the Church far outdates our culture,
but the tensions we face were real to those in Corinth. There were
class and ethnic differences in the community. But, in addition, there
were many different behaviors that manifest "spiritual gifts." But,
unlike some modern commentators who seek to encourage differences over
unity or to suppress differences for the sake of unity, Paul encouraged
these "spiritual" behaviors as a sign of God's presence. Prophecy,
utterances of wisdom, speaking in tongues, teaching, all were different
gifts of the Spirit for the good of the community. Notice, Paul pointed
to everyone in the community as a person with a spiritual gift. He
implied the use of such gifts should be exercised, not suppressed. But,
at the same time, he pointed to the reason the gifts were given: the
good of others. Gifts were not to be a sign of self-glorification. No,
they were for the glory of God!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Like the Corinthians, we all have gifts to offer
for the common good and the praise of God. How we use them, however,
determines their effectiveness. And our intention. Do our gifts unite
or divide? Do they show we are one in the Body of Christ? Or, do they
reveal divisions that crack the face of the Church?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Spirit gave us his gifts. Let us use them wisely.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>What gifts do you bring to the Church? How can
you help to build up the community? How can your gifts and service give
praise to God? </i></p>
