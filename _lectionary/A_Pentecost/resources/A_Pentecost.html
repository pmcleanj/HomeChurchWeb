</div>
<h4>The Holy Spirit, The Force of Forgiveness</h4>
<div align="right">
<p class="bodytext"><i>How is God's Spirit different from the Force in Star Wars?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">George Lucas has released Star Wars onto video and
DVD. Children of all ages can now relive the saga of the most
profitable series in movie history. They can root for the Light side of
the Force, and boo the Dark Side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Holy Spirit found in Christianity does not
mirror the dual nature of the impersonal Force. Why? The Holy Spirit
brings us love and hope. Love and hope do not have a dark side. And,
both love and hope begin with forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Holy Spirit we worship, the Holy Spirit we possess, is the Spirit of divine forgiveness.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>19 Late Sunday evening, the followers of Jesus
locked the doors of the place where they met because they feared the
Jewish leaders. Jesus appeared in the middle of them and said, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you."</font>
20 After he spoke, Jesus showed them the wounds in his hands and his
side. They felt great joy when they saw the Lord. 21 Again, Jesus said
to them, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you. Just as the Father sent me, I am sending you."</font> 22 Then, Jesus blew on them. <font color="#f00000">"Take in the Holy Spirit,"</font> Jesus said.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><font color="#f00000"><b>23 "If you forgive someone's sins, their sins are and will ever be forgiven.<br>
If you don't forgive their sins, their sins are not forgiven."</b></font></p>
<p class="bodytext">Like many other Resurrection stories, John divided
this passage into two blocks: appearance of the Risen Lord and the
commission of the disciples. For John, the breathe of the Spirit was
the sign and substance of the commission.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>19 Being evening in that first day of the week,
and the doors having been locked where the disciples were because of
fear of the (Jewish leaders.), Jesus came and stood in the middle (of
them) and said <font color="#f00000">"Peace to you."</font> 20 Having said this, he showed (his) hands and side to them. The disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</b></p>
<p class="indent">20:19 "evening in that first day of the week" is
literally "evening in that day, the first one of the sabbaths." The use
of the plural "sabbaths" indicates the time frame of a week.</p>
<p class="indent">"(Jewish leaders)" is literally "Jews." John used
generic language to indicate specific groups within in the general
culture. "Jews" were members of the Jewish leadership. "Greeks" were
the non-Jewish populace (not people born in Greece).</p>
</div>
<p class="bodytext">The scene in the gospel opened with fear and
apprehension on the part of Jesus' followers. John originally wrote
"they feared the Jews." Clearly John referred to the Jewish leaders,
especially the Pharisees. So the popular translation reflected the
relationship between Jesus and the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We should also note the relationship between John's
community and Jewish synagogues led by Pharisees. By the time John
wrote his gospel, Jewish Christians had been excommunicated for their
belief in the Messiah. Ostracized and socially persecuted, some
Christians reacted in fear, while others boldly proclaimed the gospel.
Early Christians needed as sense of stability, a sense of divine peace.
Through the words of Jesus, "Peace" was John's prayer for his readers.</p>
<div align="right">
<p class="bodytext">With the sight of Jesus, fear turned into great
joy. Anxiety turned into relief. Desperation turned into vindication.
Most important, a lack of spiritual direction turned into a sense of
deep spiritual grounding. The divine presence stood close to them. And
with the divine presence came divine peace.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>21 Jesus said to them again, </b><font color="#f00000"><b>"Peace to you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you."</b></font><b> 22 Having said this, he blew on and said to them, </b><font color="#f00000"><b>"Take
(in) the Holy Spirit. 23 If you sent away the sins of anyone, they have
been sent off for them. If you hold (their sins) back, they have been
held back."</b></font></p>
<p class="indent">20:23 This is an extremely awkward set of sentences.
The sentences are literally "Of whomever you might sent away (their)
sins, they have been sent away for them. Of whomever you might hold,
they have been held."</p>
<p class="indent">The key theological phrase is "they have been sent
away;" the verb is in the past tense, indicating the sin had been
forgiven before the pronouncement of the Church.</p>
<p class="indent">On the one hand, Jesus already suffered for that
particular sin and all the sins of the world. Hence, the declaration
would be a proclamation of the Good News. (The current form of
Sacrament of Reconciliation stresses this proclamation. In the
sacrament, we are to celebrate God's forgiveness, not our sinfulness.)</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, the implication of
"pre-forgiveness" might lead to presumption on the part of the sinner
or a sense of blessed predestination. Obviously the former sense is
meant, not the later. God holds everyone responsible for their actions,
both of sin and of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus commissioned his followers to partake in his
Messianic ministry. At the time of Jesus, Jews believed the Messiah
mission at the end of time was universal. They held the Messiah would
go out from Jerusalem to the known world, spread the Good News of
salvation, and incite a massive pilgrimage to Palestine. As he gathered
all Jews spread throughout the world home, he would call all peoples to
Jerusalem so they, too, could worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. In Jerusalem, the Messiah would judge this massive throng in a
Final Judgement, the Day of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Resurrection appearance marked the starting
point for this process. From Jerusalem, Jesus sent his followers out as
missionaries to the known world. They would testify to the Risen Christ
as the Good News of salvation. And the Good News would start the
journey home for both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What happened to the Jerusalem pilgrimage? There
were two possible answers. First, the Romans leveled Jerusalem in
response to the Jewish revolt in 66 A.D. Both the city and the
Christian mother church turned to rubble. The Jerusalem church could no
longer commission missionaries.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, Christians spiritualized the pilgrimage.
The return home always included the theme of repentance; the sinner who
walked away from God's dwelling place turned around and journeyed back.
For the Christian, a heavenly Jerusalem became an abode for God. The
sinner could find earthly reflection of Jerusalem in the local church
community. Hence, conversion and repentance were close to home.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, the followers saw their vocation within God's
plan of salvation. The Father sent the Son into the world to lead
everyone back to the Father. Jesus would involve his followers in that
same work. Since they witnessed Jesus risen, his followers would
witness to others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Jesus gave them more than a witness. He gave
them the Holy Spirit. The breathe and command to "Receive the Holy
Spirit" must be seen as two parts of the same action. "Them" (the
followers) was the object of "Jesus breathed on" and the indirect
object of "Jesus said." As Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit out, the text
inferred, his follower would breath it in, just as Jesus commanded.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We have already discussed the connection between
breathe and Spirit in past studies. The word for "Spirit" in both Greek
("pnema") and Hebrew ("ruah") was the same for breathe or wind. Ancient
people believed that any moment of air was the result of power. Breathe
was the result of an inner power, one's life force or spirit. Strong
winds that caused death and destruction were the result of God's inner
power judging sin. The breathe of inner life and violent winds, Jews
believed, came from one source, God. So, God's Spirit was a
life-giving, and life-taking power. (See Genesis 1:1 and Acts 2:7).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once the followers breathed in God's Spirit, they
shared in the Messiah's power of judgement with the power to declare
sins forgiven. John 20:23 referred to the followers' preaching of the
Good News. Missionaries like the apostles and Paul, proclaimed a
reconciliation of sinners to the Father through Christ; when sinners
repented and converted to Christianity, they were cleansed in the
waters of baptism. In the context of this verse, the process of
reconciliation began with the proclamation of the Good News (declare
sins forgiven) and continued through baptism (they are forgiven).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Notice the verb "are forgiven" is in the perfect
tense. Forgiveness began in the past, continues into the present, and
trails off into the indefinite future. In other words, once forgiven,
always forgiven. But, does forgiveness begin with the preacher's
declaration? No. The forgiveness of all sin began with Christ on the
cross. The apostles and their successors proclaimed a forgiveness that
flows from Christ's death and resurrection; the sinner partook in that
forgiveness at the point of repentance, of turning one's life over to
God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An aside: Catholics refer to John 20:23 as the
basis for the Sacrament of Penance (also known as Reconciliation or
Confession). In a Church that is an assembly of sinners, this insight
makes perfect sense. Christ continually calls the Church to never
ending conversion, just as the Christian life is a constant road back
to God. The sacrament is a celebration of God's forgiveness in which
the priest represents God and Church to the penitent. The priest
proclaims the Good News of divine mercy to the penitent, advises him or
her in spiritual counsel, and declares the penitent forgiven. In
response, the penitent prays or performs an act of justice that
symbolizes an openness of heart to God and neighbor (a so-called
"penance"). In this way, the sacrament harkens back to Baptism (which
is the original context for this verse) and, so, derives its power from
Baptism. The Sacrament of Penance, then, continues the process of
repentance Baptism put into place.</p>

<p class="sidebarsite">Catechism Themes: Pentecost (CCC 731-732)</p>
</center>
<p class="indent">With the power of the Spirit revealed at Pentecost,
the activity of the Trinity was made known. God the Father sent his Son
to share his very life, his very Spirit, with his followers. Now,
disciples would carry on the work of the Son. They would celebrate the
Spirit in their daily lives as they followed in the footsteps of their
Lord.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>God calls everyone to repentance, even second
chances. How do you respond to his call? How do you help others with
their call to conversion?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Pentecost revealed the power of God's forgiveness,
his Spirit. Unlike the Force of Star Wars, the Spirit of God is
personal. The Spirit establishes a link between the believer and the
person of the Father through the person of the Son. And the Spirit
makes that link personal. It is a link of love, hope, and joy based
upon personal forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us rejoice in the Spirit, the third person of the Trinity.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How can I celebrate a life in the Spirit this week?</i></p>
