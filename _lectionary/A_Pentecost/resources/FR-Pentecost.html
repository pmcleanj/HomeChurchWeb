<h4>Gift of the Spirit</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>1 When Pentecost day arrived, everyone
gathered together in one place. 2 Suddenly, a noise came from heaven
that sounded like a violent wind. The noise filled the house where they
sat. 3 Then fiery tongue spread out and sat on each person there. 4
Everyone was filled with the Holy Spirit. And they began to speak
foreign languages as the Spirit directed them to.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>5 Devout Jews from all over the world lived in
Jerusalem at the time. 6 When they heard the disciples speaking, a
large number of these Jews gathered together. The people in the crowd
were confused because each one of the disciples spoke to them in their
own language. 7 They were stunned, and kept wondering, "Aren't all
these people from Galilee? 8 We hear them speak in the language where
we were born. How can this be? 9 There are Parthians, Medes, and
Elamites here. There are also people from Mesopotamia, Judea,
Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia Minor. 10 We can see those from Phyrgia
and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Libya by the Cyrene. 11 There are
those visiting from Rome, both Jewish born and converts. There are even
Cretans and Arabs. 12 All of us hear God's greatness proclaimed by
these people in our own languages!"</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>1 On arrival of the day of Pentecost, all were
together in the same (place). 2 Suddenly, there was a sound came from
heaven, like a violent wind brought forth, and it filled the entire
house where they were sitting, 3 and tongues like fire completely
spreading out were seen by them, and (the tongue) sat upon each one of
them, 4 and all were filled with the Holy Spirit and they began to
speak in other languages as the Spirit was giving them to speak out.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>5 There were Jews living in Jerusalem, reverent
men from every nation under heaven. 6 As (there) were these voices, a
(large) number (of Jews) came together and were confused, because
(they) were hearing each one (of the disciples) speaking to them in
their own language. 7 They were amazed and kept wondering, saying,
"Look! Are not all these speaking Galileans? 8 How do we each hear in
our own language in which we were born? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites,
the (ones) living in Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,
10 both Phyrgia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya by the
Cyrene, and the visiting Romans, 11 both Jews and converts, Cretans and
Arabs, we (all) hear them declaring the greatness of God in our
tongues!"</b></p>
<p class="indent">2:1 "day of Pentecost" The word "Pentecost" is
literally "fifty." The festival referred to the Feast of Grain Harvest
which was celebrated fifty days after Passover (the Feast of Unleavened
Bread). While it was an agricultural feast, it gained an association
with the reception of the Law on Mt. Sinai. Although the feast began to
lose its agricultural significance in the inter-Testamental period (300
B.C. to 100 A.D.), most scholars believe this connection was finally
made after the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D. Pentecost was one
of three feasts that encouraged pilgrimage.</p>
<p class="indent">2:2 "it filled the entire house where they were
sitting" Sitting was the position of education. Hence, Luke painted the
disciples as students of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">2:5 "living in Jerusalem" is a loose term that should
not be confused with residency. Luke portrayed the city with a
cosmopolitan flavor and as a pilgrimage stop. The crowd could contain
both locals and visitors. Luke's point was not the composition of the
crowd as it was the universal import of the mission and the message.</p>
<p class="indent">2:6 "As (there) were these voices" is literally, "As
the sound happened." While the sound could have been the noise like the
wind or the proclamation of the disciples, the context argued for the
later interpretation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Breathing and life go hand-in-hand. While we might take both for granted, deny our breathe and we will panic about life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To the ancient peoples, breathing was the sign of
spirit, a person's life force. In fact, spiritus (Latin), pneuma
(Greek), and ruah (Hebrew) all mean breathe and spirit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When applied to the God, these words mean breeze or
wind; many ancient people believed that winds were the result of God's
breathe. And, by breathing, God gave life. In Genesis 1:2, God breathed
his Spirit upon the waters as a mighty wind and life began.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Among Jew, the once agricultural feast of Pentecost
[1] now celebrated the reception of God's Law on Mt. Sinai. Luke
changed this feast into the reception of the Spirit by Christians.
God's breathe filled the house like a mighty wind, and new life began
in the followers of Jesus. [2].</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, flames spread over the followers like a wind
driven wild fire. This was a sign for enlightenment (fire in the mind)
and passion (fire in the belly) [3]. With insight and motivation, the
followers of Jesus spread the Good News to others in ways that were
clearly understood [4-6].</p>
<p class="bodytext">As a center for worship on a major feast day,
Jerusalem swelled with visitors from all parts of the known world.
These visitors ( mixed with locals) gathered around and heard the
proclamation of God's great acts in their native tongues [7-11].</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the first Christian Pentecost, God breathed his
Spirit and changed the followers of Jesus. They were new creatures, for
God's very Spirit dwelled within them. With their words proclaiming
God's mighty acts, Jesus' followers breathed out God's Spirit on
others. And God's People were gathered together.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>As the place whether God's Spirit dwells, we are
his instruments in the world. What we think and say and do spreads
God's life giving breathe to others. How do we measure up to this
privilege and responsibility? </i></p>
