      <h2>Something New is Blowing In</h2>
A pastor friend told me about a meeting he had with the church council
where he was beginning interim ministry.&nbsp; He said that every
question he asked resulted in a lengthy recalling of their church's
history. One council member introduced herself as new to the
church.&nbsp; When the pastor then asked how long she had been at this
particular church she said, "Only 15 years."<br>
      <br>
One of the jobs of an interim pastor is to help a congregation&nbsp;
look towards the future.&nbsp; As part of this process, the interim
pastor asked the council: What are you looking forward to in the
future?&nbsp; Where do you want your church to be in five years?<br>
      <br>
The council was silent for quite a while. Finally the only
forward-looking event that this council could come up with was the
church&#8217;s 175th anniversary.&nbsp; This would take place the following
year.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, the interim pastor knew that there was
some work to be done.<br>
      <br>
Sadly, this church had no sense of its future.&nbsp; It only saw itself
in terms of its past.&nbsp; And unless the people&#8217;s outlook changed,
this church would not continue on into the future.&nbsp; For as
important as it is to celebrate past successes and anniversaries, it is
essential that a church also look at what God is doing in the present
and in the future.<br>
      <br>
In contrast to this congregation, the disciples stopped looking backward when they were filled with the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel<br>
      </h4>As many of us have
experienced, when someone dies the natural tendency is to look back
upon a person&#8217;s life.&nbsp; I am quite sure that when the disciples
were gathered in that upper room, stories of Jesus would have come
pouring out of each of the people.<br>
      <br>
&#8220;Remember when Jesus saved that wedding banquet.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Remember when
that blind man could see?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Remember when Mary and Martha were so
mad at Jesus for not being there for Lazarus?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Remember Lazarus
coming out of the tomb?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Remember the soldiers?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Remember
the cross?&#8221;<br>
      <br>
It is natural that as people struggle with their grief, stories
come.&nbsp; Memories flood your mind and your heart.&nbsp; The sadness
of the event and the overwhelming pain that is yours causes your mind
to circle backward, toward happier times, when things were better.<br>
      <br>
But the disciples did not stay in that grief forever.&nbsp; Really, it
was a short-lived grief.&nbsp; For on that first Easter evening
suddenly Jesus stood among them.&nbsp; And for Jesus, as much as he
always loved a good story, he did not look backward.&nbsp; Instead he
first gave them comfort and healing.&nbsp; &#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;&nbsp;
Then he told them that they were to leave the relative safety of their
shared story and tell the story to those who had not heard.&nbsp; &#8220;As
the Father has sent me, so I send you.&#8221; (20:21)<br>
      <br>
The disciples were to look forward, toward those who were still waiting
to hear.&nbsp; And he promised that they would receive the Holy Spirit
who would strengthen them, guide them, draw them together and send them
out.&nbsp; &#8220;If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if
you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&#8221;&nbsp; (20:23)<br>
      <br>

<h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading<br>
</h4>In the Anchor Bible Dictionary, Pentecost is defined as &#8220;the Greek name
for the Jewish Feast of Weeks, deriving from its occurrence fifty days
after Passover&#8230; Thus it was originally an agricultural feast marking
the end of the grain harvest and was celebrated during the month of
Sivan (May/June).&#8221; (Anchor Bible Dictionary, Volume 5, 1992, p. 222.)<br>
      <br>

This explanation of what the Pentecost festival was for the Jewish
people explains why so many Jewish people from so many areas had
converged upon Jerusalem as we hear in Acts 2.&nbsp; In the same way that
many of us want to be home for Thanksgiving or Christmas, these people
in the first century wanted to be in Jerusalem for the harvest festival
Pentecost.<br>
      <br>

The disciples were no different.&nbsp; They also wanted to gather with
family and loved ones for this harvest festival.&nbsp; But what the
disciples were not expecting, and what the people were shocked to
encounter, was that this wasn&#8217;t just a holiday of thanksgiving for the
harvest or even a chance to reminisce about days gone by.&nbsp; Instead, God
had something new in mind on this Pentecost day.<br>
      <br>

On this Pentecost, fifty days after Jesus&#8217; resurrection from the dead,
God still had more surprises up his sleeve.&nbsp; As the disciples were
gathered together, suddenly a sound like a violent wind occurred and
something like tongues of fire rested on each of the disciples. This
sound apparently was so massive and so unexpected that a crowd gathered
to see what was happening.&nbsp; As the crowd gathered, the disciples spoke
to them.&nbsp; And when they spoke, everyone gathered could understand them
in their own language.<br>
      <br>

Amazingly, through God&#8217;s breath, through the mighty wind of God, the
disciples could speak in every language of the world outside their
door. Not one language, not two languages, not even sixteen languages,
but all heard their own language, from Parthian to Arabic.&nbsp; Of course,
even in the midst of a miraculous encounter, there were skeptics.&nbsp; But
even they had to admit that something was occurring.<br>
      <br>

People had gathered to remember a holiday.&nbsp; But God pushed them towards
the future.&nbsp; And after Peter told this confused, elated, amazed group
about Jesus, three thousand of the men, women, and children were
baptized (3:41).&nbsp; Something new was blowing in!<br>

<br>

      <br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
</h4>The people of God, and apparently the rabble with them (Numbers
11:4), were all complaining about their hardships as they were in the
wilderness.&nbsp; God became angry and sent fire.&nbsp; But Moses
prayed to God and God stopped the fire and even gave them manna and
quail to eat.&nbsp; Still the people complained.&nbsp; Finally Moses
was fed up.&nbsp; He asked God, &#8220;Did I give these people birth?&#8221; (11:12)<br>
      <br>
Moses was overloaded, overwhelmed, and disheartened.&nbsp; Although he
was the leader of the group, the people&#8217;s demands had become too much.
And so God did a new thing.&nbsp; God put his Spirit into seventy
people so that Moses would have help with the irritable group of people
that God had given him!<br>
      <br>
This new distribution of leadership did not seem to upset Moses at
all.&nbsp; In fact, he welcomed it.&nbsp; When Joshua complained that
two of the men had received the Spirit without being in the right place
at the right time, Moses said, &#8220;Are you jealous for my sake?&nbsp;
Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets, and that the LORD would
put his spirit on them!&#8221; (11:30)<br>
      <br>
Again, God was pushing this group of people towards a new future &#8211; a
future where things were not always so comfortable.&nbsp; Even for the
people who were used to complaining this brought a whole new set of
items to complain about.<br>
      <br>
I admit that when new things are forced upon me I sometimes
rebel.&nbsp; As people of God, how can we tell when new things are sent
by the Spirit of God?&nbsp; How do we know when &#8220;new ideas&#8221; are not
from God?<br>
      <br>
If you continued reading this story of the Israelite people in Numbers
you would find that even Aaron and Miriam could not always distinguish
what was God&#8217;s Spirit and what was not.&nbsp; Perhaps this gives us
hope that sometimes it just takes time to see what the Spirit is
doing.&nbsp; In any case, know that on this Pentecost Sunday, the
Spirit of God is at work.&nbsp; It is blowing.&nbsp; It is free.&nbsp;
And where it ends up only God knows.&nbsp; But this we know for sure:
Always, constantly, something new is blowing in!<br>

<h6 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion<br>
</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>The disciples were in
the upper room together when Jesus came to them on that first Easter
evening.&nbsp; What do Jesus&#8217; words signify to the disciples?&nbsp;
What are they now called to do and to be?</li><li>What is significant
about our holiday of Thanksgiving?&nbsp; What is the primary focus of
this day?&nbsp; How is this day like the Jewish Pentecost?&nbsp; Could
there be something &#8220;new&#8221; for us to celebrate on Thanksgiving?</li>
        <li>The story of Pentecost is pretty much unbelievable for
skeptic minds.&nbsp; What would have been your reaction on that day if
you were in the mist of the crowds?&nbsp; Would you have called the
disciples crazy or drunk?&nbsp; Would you have gone along with the
crowd or slipped quietly away?&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>How are we a people of history?&nbsp; A people &#8220;of the
story&#8221;?&nbsp; How are we a people leaning toward the future?&nbsp; How
do we bring our shared story into the future?</li>
        <li>The Israelite people complained against God constantly when
they were in the wilderness.&nbsp; Are there times when our prayers are
only complaint?&nbsp; How does God make our lives new?&nbsp; With this
newness, is there sometimes even more complaint from us?</li>
