</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Questions 
<br>
Two weeks ago, the readings suggested reflection on the presence of God. Today&#8217;s 
readings direct our attention to the power of God, with "a sound like the rush 
of a violent wind," "divided tongues as of fire," and an amazing linguistic incident 
in which people of many different languages and lands &#8211; representing the known 
world at that time &#8211; were, in that moment, one in their hearing, if not their 
understanding of the deeper meaning of what they heard. Despite their differences, 
they could all hear what the disciples were saying, each in their own language. 
</font>
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">This 
story has up-ended the Tower of Babel story, in which different languages effectively 
divided the people, one from another. There was, in fact, an ancient utopian ideal 
of one universal language, and this story provides an interesting twist on that 
aspiration. The Spirit of God has rushed in to empower many different kinds of 
people to do something astounding &#8211; communicate with one another effectively. 
Bridges were built and crossed in a moment, and the differences among them, instead 
of dividing, provided startling illustration of just how great the power of God 
is. Underneath the differences of nationality and language, there was a fundamental 
unity that was not only touched but enlivened and experienced, profoundly, by 
many who were there. Others scoffed and interpreted even the most amazing of events 
through the eyes and ears of cynicism, but those with hearts and minds that were 
open to the movement of the Spirit knew that a new day had come. </font>
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Births 
are rarely neat, tidy, or quiet, and the birth of the church is no different. 
The feast of Pentecost &#8211; of harvest &#8211; is an interesting time to think about pregnancy 
and birth, and the great crowd of converts is its own kind of harvest and yet 
leads to even greater possibilities of growth and new life. In addition, the disciples, 
cowering and confused, experience their own kind of rebirth or transformation 
by the power of this Spirit who blows into the scene on the rush of a mighty wind, 
with great noise and even with fire. In this case, fire and wind bring not destruction 
but new life. As with birth, it may not be quiet or peaceful, but it is exhilarating 
and good. </font>
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
The story of Pentecost echoes the Tower of Babel story, it is true, by remembering 
that language, among other things, can unite or divide us. Across so many divides, 
we strive for unity and understanding. Another &#8220;up-ending&#8221; happens with the quotation 
from the prophet Joel, whose words originally warned of a terrible time of destruction 
and death. Used here by Peter, the words have a different kind of promise, the 
promise of new life and new hope, of lives transformed not only as individuals 
but as the church. We hear them differently than those who heard them for the 
first time, so long ago. </font>
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In 
the United Church of Christ, we often say that <i><b>God is still speaking</b></i>. 
As you reflect on this story of the birth of the church, how much does it relate 
to the life of your church today? What are the &#8220;languages&#8221; that may divide the 
folks in your church, or at least make unity more difficult to achieve? What have 
been experiences of deep unity, across differences? How do our differences actually 
enrich and enliven what we share? How do we reach across so many differences, 
not only in language and culture but also in religious upbringing, economic class, 
educational background, and basic personality types, to communicate effectively, 
to hear what <i><b>God is still speaking</b></i> today, bringing us a call that 
may astound us and gather us into something more effective and more amazing that 
we were before? What events and experiences have made us cower, have made us confused? 
What sort of power did &#8211; or does &#8211; it take to draw us out of our "all together 
in one place" and send us out with courage and energy to proclaim the good news 
of the Risen Christ? What loud noises and rushing wind do we require? </font>
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">What 
sorts of things astonish us now? What does it take to astonish us? We live in 
a time of technological wonders and have come to expect regular improvements in 
the "stuff" of our lives. What astonishing things happen quietly in the life of 
your church, and in the lives of the members of your church? What stories need 
to be up-ended and heard in a whole new light, even if we are all speaking the 
same language? What is the basic unity that we share, that the people in your 
congregation and its neighborhood, share? What deep spiritual bond brings us together 
across every kind of barrier and difference? How do we appreciate our differences 
and yet find that common ground?

hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus 
said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you." 
When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy 
Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain 
the sins of any, they are retained." </font>

rivers of living water.&#8217;" Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in 
him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus was not yet

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->
</font> 
<p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In 
ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm 
at each Sunday service, in this order:</font> 
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel</font> 
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.</font> 
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music.</font> 
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.</font> 
</p><p><font sans="sans" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> 
During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets 
of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous 
reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related 
to the other readings.</font>
