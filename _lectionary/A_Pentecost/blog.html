			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In my junior year of high school, I
			landed in the hospital several times because one of my lungs kept
			collapsing. It wasn&rsquo;t due to an injury; each collapse was
			spontaneous, owing to a genetic predisposition not uncommon among
			tall, skinny girls. (It often comes accessorized with a mild heart
			murmur, something I didn&rsquo;t know until a doctor picked it up
			in a routine exam a few years ago.) Normally a really healthy kid,
			I was concerned about the inordinate level of excitement it
			stirred in my doctor&rsquo;s office. After he had his nurses come
			and listen to my chest, my doctor explained that I&rsquo;d have to
			go to the hospital to get my lung reinflated. I imagined something
			like a bicycle pump, a quick procedure that would have me out in
			time to take a major test the next day. Instead, I spent the next
			five days getting intimately acquainted with a chest tube and the
			oddities of morphine.</P>
			<P>The trip to the hospital provided only a temporary fix for my
			lung. When a partial collapse the next month was followed by a
			complete collapse the month after that, I knew the next step would
			be more drastic. The chest tube was put back in, and this time,
			they poured tetracycline down it. A recently developed

<P>developed alternative to surgery, tetracycline served to form scar
tissue to keep the lung intact and prevent it from collapsing again.</P>
<P>Painkillers and local anesthesia only do so much to dull the
sensation of acid flowing over your innards. Mostly I remember
unbelievable pressure on my chest, the sensation that I could not
breathe, would never do it again, that my body would not remember
how. But in the wake of the fire came breath: breath that came
without assistance, breath that sustained itself and did not seep
out. In time I came to understand the experience as a gift, one
marked by the presence of God, who did not inflict it upon me but
used it as an occasion of transformation, an experience of
initiation. With the fire and the breath came knowledge: I would
never be in my body in the same way. It altered how I experienced my
own body, and it changed how I would engage people whose bodies are
vulnerable. A good gift for a girl who would grow up to be a pastor.</P>
<P>That initiation of fire and breath has been much on my mind as the
day of Pentecost approaches. A defining day in the life of the early
church, Pentecost finds its roots in the Jewish tradition, where it
is called Shavuot or the Festival of Weeks. Falling fifty days after
Passover, Shavuot is a harvest festival and also commemorates the
giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. <A HREF="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=76959409">Acts
2.1-21</A> tells us it is on this festival day that the followers of
Jesus are &ldquo;all together in one place&rdquo; when the Spirit
appears. It arrives as a rushing wind, filling them, in-spiring them,
causing them to draw breath and speak. The scene at Pentecost offers
a brilliant display of how in Greek, as in Hebrew, the word for
Spirit, wind, and breath is the same: <STRONG>pneuma</STRONG> (In
Hebrew, <STRONG>ruach</STRONG>).</P>
<P>Along with the wind comes fire, a symbol that stirs our collective
memory of the God whose transforming presence has so often been
marked by flames. Think of Moses and the burning bush, the column of
fire that led the people of Israel through the wilderness, the temple
fire that consumed the sacrificial offerings. &ldquo;For the Lord
your God is a devouring fire,&rdquo; Deuteronomy 4.24 tells us. In
contemporary culture, we most often experience fire as a contained,
controlled, gentle force. Yet the fires of Pentecost are not the tame
flames of birthday candles or a cozy winter&rsquo;s hearth; the fires
of Pentecost are a sign of the God who resists our every attempt to
domesticate the divine and to control how the holy will work.</P>
<P>For the followers of Jesus, the day of Pentecost becomes an
occasion of profound initiation. With the gift of spirit and flame,
the community that Jesus had formed is now fired, prepared, propelled
into a new stage of its journey. Like a vessel in the furnace of a
kiln, the followers of Jesus receive the transformation they need.
They are no longer a group of believers but rather a catalyzed
community, a body that, enlivened by the Spirit, will endure and
continue the work of Christ.</P>
<P>As those followers knew, we can&rsquo;t always plan our moments of
initiation. If we cannot control God, it follows that we cannot
control the ways that God beckons or, sometimes, seemingly flings us
across a new threshold. We can work to make ourselves available when
it happens, but we don&rsquo;t always get to choose our initiations.</P>
<P>In her book <STRONG>Reinventing Eve</STRONG>, Kim Chernin
describes initiation this way:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Initiation is not a predictable process. It moves forward
fitfully, through moments of clear seeing, dramatic episodes of
feeling, subtle intuitions, vague contemplative states. Dreams
arrive, bringing guidance we frequently cannot accept. Years pass,
during which we know that we are involved in something that cannot
easily be named. We wake to a sense of confusion, know that we are in
dangerous conflict, cannot define the nature of what troubles us. All
change is like this. It circles around, leads us a merry chase,
starts us out it seems all over again from where we were in the first
place. And then suddenly, when we least expect it, something opens a
door, discovers a threshold, shoves us across.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At Pentecost, initiation occurred not only at the individual level
(&rdquo;and a tongue rested on each of them&rdquo;) but also at the
corporate level. The outpouring of the Spirit upon the whole
community reminds us that we are not on an individual journey but a
shared one. God calls us, compels us, to attend to the Spirit in one
another.</P>
<P>The celebration of Pentecost beckons us to keep breathing. It
challenges us to keep ourselves open to the Spirit who seeks us. The
Spirit that, in the beginning, brooded over the chaos and brought
forth creation; the Spirit that drenched the community with fire and
breath on the day of Pentecost: this same Spirit desires to dwell
within us and among us. Amidst the brokenness and chaos and pain that
sometimes come with being in community, the Spirit searches for
places to breathe in us, to transform us, to knit us together more
deeply and wholly as the body of Christ, and to send us forth into
the world.</P>
<P>As we approach Pentecost, what occasions of initiation do you
remember? Sought or unbidden, how did those experiences alter you,
transform you, change who you are in this world? How did they deepen
your understanding of yourself, your community, and how God desires
to breathe through you? How do you continue to open yourself to the
work of the Spirit in you and in those around you?</P>
<P>Blessings to you in these days of celebration. May we keep
breathing. May we blaze.</P>
