						</div>
						<h4>God's Gift of Peace</h4>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>When the last time you truly felt peaceful?</i></p>
						<p class="bodytext">Peace
is more than a lack of conflict. A lull in action between two opponents
only gives them a chance to regroup, to recharge for the next round. A
void of violence does not lead to happiness.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">True
peace, on the other hand, gives us happiness, since it is build on
trust. The gospel tells us how Jesus gave his followers peace because
they trusted him. In spite of scepticism, he offers us the same peace.</p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>19
Late Sunday evening, the followers of Jesus locked the doors where they
met because they feared the Jewish leaders. Jesus appeared before them
and said, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you."</font> 20 After
he spoke, Jesus showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They
felt great joy when they saw the Lord. 21 Again, Jesus said to them, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you. Just as the Father sent me, I am sending you."</font> 22 Then, Jesus blew on them. <font color="#f00000">"Take in the Holy Spirit,"</font> Jesus said.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>23 <font color="#f00000">"If you forgive someone's sins, their sins are and will ever be forgiven.</font></b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#f00000">If you don't forgive their sins, their sins are not forgiven."</font></b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>24
But Thomas the Twin, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus
appeared. 25 The other followers told him over and over, "We've seen
the Lord!" Thomas replied, "I won't believe it until I inspect the nail
scars in his hands and touch the scar in his side."</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>26
The next Sunday, the followers were inside along with Thomas. 27 Jesus
came into the locked room, stood in the before them, and said, <font color="#f00000">"Peace be with you."</font> Then Jesus said to Thomas, <font color="#f00000">"Take your finger and inspect my hands here. Take your hand and inspect my side. Give up your doubts and believe!"</font> 28 Thomas replied "You are my Lord and my God!" 29 Jesus said to him,<font color="#f00000"> "You believe because you have seen me. Those who haven't seen me and believe are really happy."</font></b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>30
Jesus performed many other miracles that are not written down in this
book. 31 These miracles have been written down so you can still believe
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and, believing, you can have life
in his name.</b></p>
						<p class="bodytext">In this gospel, John
related two resurrection stories and two verse many scholars believe
were the original ending to the gospel. The first section focused upon
the gift of the Spirit, the second upon faith, and the third upon the
reason for evangelization.</p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>19 Being
evening in that first day of the week, and the doors having been locked
where the disciples were because of fear of the (Jewish leaders.),
Jesus came and stood in the middle (of them) and said <font color="#f00000">"Peace to you."</font>
20 Having said this, he showed (his) hands and side to them. The
disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again, <font color="#f00000">"Peace to you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you."</font> 22 Having said this, he blew on and said to them, <font color="#f00000">"Take
(in) the Holy Spirit. 23 If you sent away the sins of anyone, they have
been sent off for them. If you hold (their sins) back, they have been
held back."</font></b></p>
						<p class="indent">20:19 "evening in
that first day of the week" is literally "evening in that day, the
first one of the sabbaths." The use of the plural "sabbaths" indicates
the time frame of a week.</p>
						<p class="indent">"(Jewish
leaders)" is literally "Jews." John used generic language to indicate
specific groups within in the general culture. "Jews" were members of
the Jewish leadership. "Greeks" were the non-Jewish populace (not
people born in Greece).</p>
						<p class="indent">20:23 This is an
extremely awkward set of sentences. The sentences are literally "Of
whomever you might sent away (their) sins, they have been sent away for
them. Of whomever you might hold, they have been held."</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
key theological phrase is "they have been sent away;" the verb is in
the past tense, indicating the sin had been forgiven before the
pronouncement of the Church.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">On the one
hand, Jesus already suffered for that particular sin and all the sins
of the world. Hence, the declaration would be a proclamation of the
Good News. (The current form of Sacrament of Reconciliation stresses
this proclamation. In the sacrament, we are to celebrate God's
forgiveness, not our sinfulness.)</p>
						<p class="bodytext">On the
other hand, the implication of "pre-forgiveness" might lead to
presumption on the part of the sinner or a sense of blessed
predestination. Obviously the former sense is meant, not the later. God
holds everyone responsible for their actions, both of sin and of faith.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
his gospel, John gave the reason the followers gathered together behind
locked doors. They feared the Jewish leadership. "If they killed
Jesus," the followers reasoned, "the leadership would certainly be
looking for us." [20:19a]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Barred doors
made Jesus' followers look more suspicious. At the time, trust within
the Jewish community was built upon open access. Doors were never
locked. Neighbor children could enter one's house at will. Jews lived
private lives in the open. Anyone who locked their doors (save the
rural family who lived miles from their neighbor), cut themselves off
from the community.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Suddenly Jesus
appeared in the locked room and greeted his followers with " Shalom."
[20:19b] Shalom ("peace" in Hebrew) meant God was working in the world.
When God worked, he put the world in balance. No war, no hatred, no
cynicism could overcome God's providence. When God worked, he put the
spirit in balance. No fear, no doubt, no lack of trust could overcome
the sheer joy of God's presence. Shalom meant everything was right in
God's world.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">When his followers saw
Jesus alive with his deadly wound, they realized the "Shalom" of Jesus,
for they witnessed God's activity in the world. Fear left them, for now
they believed. Joy entered their hearts. [20:20]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Again
Jesus said "Shalom" with a command and a gift. The command: Go into the
world. As the Father send Jesus into the physical world, Jesus would
now send his followers into the cultural world. [20:21]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">With
the command came the gift: the Holy Spirit. In Greek (pneuma) and
Hebrew (ruah), the word "spirit" can be translated as "breath" In
20:22, the word "breathe on" in Greek can be seen only here and in
Genesis 2:7 of the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Bible used by
the early Church) where God breathed life into Adam. So, when Jesus
breathed on his followers, he gave them his Spirit. When the followers
took in the Spirit, they received his newly risen life. [20:22]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Now
they could obey the missionary command to proclaim repentance and
forgive sin. Jesus told his followers to forgive or retain sin like a
knot loosening or tied closely together. If the followers forgive,
however, they must loosen the sinner from the guilt now and in the
future. Sin was never to be brought up again. [20:23]</p>
						<p class="tealtitle">Catechism Themes: CCC 645-647</p>
						<p class="indent">We
do not know what Christ's risen body is like. On the one hand, the
risen Jesus could be touched by his followers. His body still had the
wounds of the passion. On the other hand, he entered locked rooms at
will and appeared to his followers as he wished. His body was not
limited by space and time. While his body possessed signs of his past,
it was transformed to a new plane. The body of Christ now possessed the
power of the Spirit.</p>
						<p class="indent">The resurrection was
at once a moment in history two millennium ago and a moment for all
time. That which space and time bound was raised to the eternal. When
we profess Christ is risen, we acknowledge our faith in a life beyond
despite our present limitations. We can touch that very life through
the Spirit. And, because of the Spirit, our shortcomings that stand in
the way of eternal life can be swept aside.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>Why does the Christian walk lead through forgiveness to peace? Have you experienced that road?</i></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>24
But Thomas, one of the Twelve, the one called "Twin," was not there
when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples were saying to him, "We have
seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the
mark of the nails, and thrust my finger into the mark of the nails, and
thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe (you)." 26 After eight
days, again the disciples were inside, and Thomas (was) with them.
Jesus came (although) the doors had been locked, he stood in the middle
(of them) and said, <font color="#f00000">"Peace to you."</font> 27 Then he said to Thomas, <font color="#f00000">"Take
your finger here and inspect my hands; take your hand and thrust (it)
into my side. Do not become unbelieving but believing."</font> 28 Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord and My God!" 29 Jesus said to him,<font color="#f00000"> "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Happy (are) those not having seen and having believed."</font></b></p>
						<p class="bodytext">Preachers
have called Thomas the "Doubter." Few have touched upon his cynicism.
Over and over, Thomas heard the witness of the followers. But, Thomas
wanted more than proof positive. ("Inspect and touch," literally meant
"to see and thrust.") He stepped beyond skepticism into cynicism.
[20:24-25]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">A week later, Jesus again
appear with the greeting of "Shalom." Turning to Thomas, Jesus answered
the challenge of cynicism with the challenge of faith. Thomas responded
with two titles for Jesus: Lord and God. Thomas acknowledged the
rightful place of Jesus as Lord; he also saw God working through the
Risen Christ. Thomas finally received Christ's gift of Shalom.
[20:26-28]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In contrast to Thomas, Jesus
blessed those who believed without seeing him raised from the dead.
[20:29] Here John used the word "believe" in two senses: to trust
("believe in") and to hold onto the truth ("believe (something)
about..."). Blessed were those who placed their personal trust in
Christ (believe in); they do not need proof of his resurrection, for
they know he is alive. But, even blessed are those who hold onto the
truths of faith (believe...about), for, with an open heart, they will
soon experience the risen Christ. Belief in these two sense stood
against the cynicism found in Thomas.</p>
						<p class="tealtitle">Catechism Themes: CCC 651-655</p>
						<p class="indent">Without
the Resurrection, Christianity would be nothing more than a school that
taught the wisdom of a great teacher. With the Resurrection, however,
Christianity became a road to intimacy with God.</p>
						<p class="indent">The
Resurrection justifies the life, works, and teachings of Jesus. Through
the lens of the Resurrection, we can see this life, these works and
teachings in the context of Scripture and realize "Jesus is Lord."
Faith in the Resurrection leads us to the conclusion Jesus is true God
and true man.</p>
						<p class="indent">Through the Resurrection, we
receive the gift of a new eternal life, free from evil. We become one
with our Savior who died and rose for us. And, as he rose, Christ
assures us that we, too, will rise on the last day.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>How does the cynicism of the world affect you? How does faith keep you from cynicism?</i></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>30
Indeed, Jesus also did many other signs before his disciples which are
not written down in this small book. 31 These have been written that
you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that
believing, you might have life in his name.</b></p>
						<p class="indent">20:31
"you might believe" can also be translated "you might continue to
believe." John's gospel, then, would not be for evangelizing the
non-Christian, but strengthening the believer.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
peace Christ give us heals the fear and cynicism of the world. This
peace builds bridges of trust and allows us to walk together to the
Father. His peace allows us to continue to believe and to hold on to
his very life. Let us, then, offer each other the peace of Christ, the
Shalom of his Spirit.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>How can you offer the peace of Christ to others in your daily life? </i></p>
