</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to
Luke. Beginning with Jesus' ascension, Luke tells the story of the
beginnings of the church. By no means a comprehensive history, it
does however describe the spread of the church from Jerusalem to all
of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he reports show how
Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of the
struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The
Holy Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through
much of the Roman Empire. </FONT>

<P><STRONG>Acts 5:27-32</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Peter and John have been arrested by the religious authorities for
teaching and proclaiming that &ldquo;in Jesus there is resurrection
of the dead&rdquo; (<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+4%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4:2</A>).
The Sanhedrin has ordered them &ldquo;not to speak or teach at all in
the name of Jesus&rdquo; (<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+4%3A18" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4:18</A>).
So popular are they with the people that the Sanhedrin does not
punish them. But later the growth in believers leads the high priest
to take further action; he and the Sadducees see the disciples doing
what they cannot do, i.e. healing the sick. This time, all the
apostles are imprisoned; however, a divine messenger sets them free
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A19" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">19</A>).
They go right back to preaching &ndash; in the outer court of the
Temple (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A21" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">21</A>).
The temple police bring them to appear before the council.</P>
<P>Now the high priest imputes that the apostles place the blame for
Jesus&rsquo; death on the religious authorities (&ldquo;you are
determined ...&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A28" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">28</A>).
Led by Peter, they insist that they must obey God&rsquo;s will rather
than the Sanhedrin&rsquo;s orders (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A29" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">29</A>).
They explain in Jewish terms: the &ldquo;God of our ancestors&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A30" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">30</A>)
is the God of Israel (and of Christians): he has &ldquo;raised&rdquo;
Jesus from the dead. The Law prescribed that a person guilty of a
capital offence be hanged &ldquo;on a tree&rdquo;; Peter interprets
<EM>cross</EM> as being the Roman equivalent to the Jewish <EM>tree</EM>.
Moses was &ldquo;Leader and Saviour&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A31" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">31</A>)
of Israel, under God; Jesus is much more so: he <EM>goes before us</EM>;
now with the Father, he continues to rescue us from sin and death.
Jesus&rsquo; message was first to &ldquo;Israel&rdquo;. Both the
apostles and the &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A32" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">32</A>),
given to the faithful, are &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; to Christ&rsquo;s
actions.</P>
<P>The council members are so enraged that they want to kill Peter,
but a famous liberal rabbi, Gamaliel, cautions them: &ldquo;if this
... is of human origin, it will fail&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A38" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">38</A>);
but if it is from God, they &ldquo;will not be able to overthrow
them&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A39" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">39</A>)
and they will be working against God. Peter and John are flogged for
their earlier offence. Despite being ordered not to preach the Good
News, the apostles continue to do so, both in the Temple and in
homes.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><B>Acts
5:12-16</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<H4>A Ministry of Wholeness</H4>
<P>5:12b-13a: &ldquo;With a common purpose, all (the believers) were
in the Portico of Solomon, but no one of those remaining dared to be
joined to them.&rdquo; 5:12 b seemed to indicate the Solomon&rsquo;s
Portico was a commonly known gathering place for the Christians in
Jerusalem. 5:13a seemed to indicate potential converts did not dare
to join them.</P>
<P>5:14 &ldquo;More were being added to (those) trusting in the Lord&rdquo;
can also be translated &ldquo;More trusting (ones) were being added
to the Lord.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;more&rdquo; can be translated as
a noun or as an adjective.</P>
<P>Like Acts 2:43-47 and 4:32-37, these verses act as summary and a
transition. Unlike the other two mentioned that summarized life in
the community, 5:12-16 summarize the evangelization efforts of the
Jerusalem leadership. And, in the context of Acts 5, these verses
acted as a transition point between the controversy within the
community over shared property (4:32-5:11) and the ongoing
controversy outside the community with the Temple leadership
(5:17-42).</P>
<P>Luke wrote these verses in an &ldquo;A-B-A&rdquo; form. Comments
over miraculous powers formed the &ldquo;A&rdquo; sections while &ldquo;B&rdquo;
consisted of the community&rsquo;s growth. Taken together, these
verses answer two questions. First, how did the community reach out
to grow? Second, why did the community grow despite the reluctance of
the people in Jerusalem?</P>
<P>The answer to both questions lay in the healing ministry of the
Apostles. We moderns like to reduce healing ministry to the body, but
clearly this ministry did much more. Within the context of the times,
the ministry took charge over the spirit world, especially over those
malevolent spirits who caused physical, psychological, and social
evil. The end result of their ministry was the wholeness of people.
The &ldquo;signs and wonders done at the hands of the Apostles&rdquo;
brought the sick and the outcast not only health. These miracles
restored the healed to their places in families and in the community.
For Luke, this ministry of wholeness was the first step in
evangelization.</P>
<P>We might not have the power to cure, but we do have the tools to
help make others whole. Our compassion, our outreach, our initiative
to the outsiders can be the first steps in bringing others to Christ.
Why? Because, like the Apostles, our efforts reveal the power of God.
Our ministry to wholeness shows others what sort of God we profess to
trust. It shows others we are his instruments, his means to bring
others into the fold.</P>
<P><I>How have you reached out to help others? How has God rewarded
you efforts?</I></P>

</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
doesn&rsquo;t take many trips &ldquo;around the block&rdquo; with the
3-year lectionary to realize that the same gospel reading appears
every year on the second Sunday of Easter. This is one of the givens
of church life. The crowds that had come for the Easter celebration
have dissipated, the Easter flowers are starting to droop, the
worship leaders are tired, and preachers face the task of trying to
say something new about this familiar text. The Sunday after Easter
is often nicknamed &ldquo;Low Sunday&rdquo;&ndash; understandably so.
Not only are we tired, but in the gospel reading, we encounter the
disciples at a &ldquo;low point.&rdquo; Jesus has been crucified and
now they&rsquo;re hiding behind locked doors in fear. They are
gathered together on the first day of the week, on Sunday, the day of
resurrection. Attendance is a little low &ndash; Thomas didn&rsquo;t
come. But Jesus enters their gathering, bringing them peace and
forgiveness. <BR><BR>The next week, they gather again, and again
Jesus comes into their midst to share the peace with them. Is this
starting to sound a bit like worship? Gathering on the first day of
the week, the day of resurrection.... sharing the peace........
experiencing the presence of Christ....... confessing faith.....
being blessed and given the gift of forgiveness..... empowered by the
Holy Spirit and being sent back out into the world&ndash; what the
disciples are doing after the resurrection sounds like what we do,
Sunday after Sunday. Some weeks we are at a &ldquo;low point.&rdquo;
Some weeks, there are people missing. Sometimes our worshiping
community may be gripped by doubt, and sometimes we may even &ldquo;lock
the doors&rdquo; because we feel threatened by change or because we
want the church to be a refuge from the dangers of the world. And
week after week, Jesus is present, offering us peace and forgiveness,
feeding us, and sending us out into the world in his name. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>This is the last book of the Bible and is in a way a
summary of the whole of the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision
which foretells the future and presents an understanding of the past.
It tells of the struggle between good and evil, and the ultimate
victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic language, its author urges
Christians to keep faith in a period of persecution. It is hard to
understand because we do not know the meaning of the symbols (e.g.
animals) it uses. </FONT>

<P>John begins and ends this book as a letter. Literally, it is &ldquo;to
the seven churches that are in Asia&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+1%3A4" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4a</A>),
Asia being a Roman province in western Asia Minor, but &ldquo;seven&rdquo;
symbolizes totality, so John may speak to all churches in the
province, or to all everywhere. The salutation combines both Greek
(&ldquo;grace&rdquo;) and Hebrew (&ldquo;peace&rdquo;) forms, and is
from God, here described as being throughout time, meaning <EM>eternal</EM>.
The salutation is also from &ldquo;the seven spirits&rdquo;: perhaps
meaning the Spirit of God (in Isaiah <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+11%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11:2</A>,

<H4>The Commission of John the Elder</H4>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">1:12 &ldquo;gold lamp stands&rdquo;
were gold plated stands that held clay bowls filled with olive oil.
The bowl had a spout at an end with a wick. The oil fed the flame at
the wick. The stands evoke the seven flame menorahs of the Temple
(Exodus 21:35-40), or in the vision of the prophet Zechariah
(Zechariah 4:1-2).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">1:13 &ldquo;(one) like the son of man&rdquo;
The phrase &ldquo;son of man&rdquo; had a generic sense and a
particularly religious sense. In the generic sense, it meant &ldquo;
a common human being.&rdquo; In the religious sense, it had the
overtones of the heavenly figure in Daniel 7:13. Jesus slid between
both senses as he used the title to refer to himself; he was like
everyone else and he was God&rsquo;s chosen. John seemed to use the
phrase in the same way.</FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">gold sash&rdquo; could also be
&ldquo;gold belt.&rdquo; The sash could have been colored like gold
or made from threads of gold. A metal belt made of pure gold seemed
less likely.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">1:15 &ldquo;polished metal&rdquo; The
type of metal is unknown. Most translators use &ldquo;bronze,&rdquo;
&ldquo;brass,&rdquo; or &ldquo;precious metal.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P>In the Book of Revelation, John the Elder received a commission to
write. What he wrote and how he wrote has caused much controversy and
confusion over the past two millennia.</P>
<P>The commission John received had three parts: the voice announcing
the command to write, the presence of the One giving the command, and
restatement of the command with a revelation.</P>
<P>After the opening greeting, the author John justified his message
to the seven churches and his vision of the end times in three ways:
empathy with fellow believers, spiritual activity, and a commission.
First, John identified himself as an equal, not only in his place
within the Church, but his place with those suffering persecution.
Notice the tension between the three elements he shared with those in
the churches; the presence of the Kingdom connected suffering in the
persecution with patient endurance for the coming of the Lord in
glory. It was the partial realized nature of the Kingdom that allowed
the communities to suffer the wrath of the outside with anticipation
of the Second Coming. [1:9a]</P>
<P>John&rsquo;s empathy did not end when he identified with their
situation. He pointed out his geography. He was on Patmos, a tiny
island (five miles wide by eight miles long) in the Aegean Sea off
the coast of modern-day Turkey. He was in the vicinity. While we do
not know if John was somehow persecuted for his activities
(&ldquo;preaching God&rsquo;s word and the truth of Jesus&rdquo;), we
can imagine John felt he walked with those in seven assemblies.
(Later, about 190 A.D., Clement of Alexandria, in The Rich Man&rsquo;s
Salvation, wrote John was exiled on Patmos for his preaching.)</P>
<P>Second, John &ldquo;was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;
The result of the Spirit&rsquo;s activity was a voice of commission
[10b-11] and a vision of the Lord [12-20]. What did John mean when he
said he was &ldquo;in the Spirit.&rdquo; Many commentators assume
John was in a trance. But John did not emphasize his duty as a writer
of visions but a recorder of prophecies (see 1:3). His model of
prophecy was obviously Daniel. In a movement that anticipated the
immanent return of the Lord, the utterance of prophecy might commonly
take the shape of &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; visions. In 1 Corinthians
12:9, Paul listed prophecy as one of the many gifts of the Spirit
given to the community. Add to the mix that John might have been with
the assembly at worship &ldquo;on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo; We can
just as easily speculate John recorded the prophetic utterance of the
community on Patmos as he was alone in a complete trance. In the end,
we do not know how John received the vision, we just have the end
result. [1:10a]</P>
<P>Third, in the prophecy, John heard a voice from heaven that
commissioned him to write what he witnessed. The loud sound of the
trumpet could represent a call to worship as much as a commission. As
we will see, who John saw when he turned to see the source of the
voiced caused him to fall prostate in worship (see 1:17a). In the
commission, the voice commanded John to write to the seven churches
in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), within several days journey from
Patmos. While the author listed specific churches, the number seven
represented the fullness of the Christian experience in community. In
other words, the praises and curses found in Revelations could be
applied to any group of church communities. [1:11]</P>
<P>After John turned to see the source of the voice, he gazed within
the temple of heaven, decorated with lamp stands. In the midst stood
&ldquo;one like the Son of Man.&rdquo; Notice the appearance of the
figure projected the power of God. The man was clothed in official
(even priestly) vestments accented in gold. His hair was white to
denote age, wisdom, and power. His eyes were intense and his voice
had a commanding projection (water in torrents) with the power of
judgment (tongue like a two-edged sword). His face shone like the
sun, denoting a divine presence (as in the Transfiguration; see
Matthew 17:1-9). And in his hand, he held the power of the cosmos
(the seven stars). Taking the lamp stands and the figure together, we
have a vision of the heavenly court, where God&rsquo;s chosen would
pronounce his judgment on the world (see the dream in Daniel
10:5-14).</P>
<P>John reacted to the vision of the &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; by
falling prostrate in fear and worship. Compare this scene to Matthew
28:2-3, where the angel appeared white as lightning and the guards
fell prostrate as dead men (also see Daniel 8:17, 10:9-11). While the
sight of the divine caused fear and trembling, in the Spirit, it also
caused praise. [1;17a-b]</P>
<P>In response, the Son of Man comforted John (again compare with
Matthew 17:9). Then he declared who he was as a prelude to the his
revelation. Notice again the three part construction where the
dissimilar middle element bridged two like elements on either side.
In the middle, the Son of Man revealed himself as the risen Jesus (&ldquo;I
was dead and Look! I am alive into the ages of ages&rdquo;). On
either side of this element laid the announcement of his divinity.
The first element echoed the words and phrasing of 1:9: the beginning
and the end (the Alpha and the Omega) and the Living One. The last
element stated his power; with control over death and the
after-world, the Lord was almighty. [1:17c-18]</P>
<P>This three element construction also carried through this section.
The vision-declaration of divinity (1:12-18) has two bookend command
elements (&ldquo;Write...&rdquo;). The first command to write told
John the addresses of his correspondence. Now, the Lord commanded
John to write what he saw, both present and future events. [1:19]</P>
<P>After the vision and the declaration came the revelation: the
meaning of the gold stands and the stars. The gold stands as signs of
worship in the Temple were symbolized in the seven churches, the
assemblies where the faithful praised God for gift of Jesus. The
seven stars were the angels (i.e., power of God&rsquo;s message) to
the churches. In the first century A.D., the stars were commonly seen
as the instruments that held the divine will. Notice the lamp stands
and the stars pointed heavenward. Again, the communities worshiped as
if they were in the assembly of the saved before the throne of God.</P>
<P>In company of angels and before the Son of Man, John was to write
prophecy to the seven churches. He empathized with their condition.
And he shared with their worship in &ldquo;Spirit.&rdquo; His words
were from the Lord, to challenge the complacent and comfort the
persecuted.</P>
<P>This is the essence of prophecy. It is our mission to prophecy in
the Lord&rsquo;s name and in the Lord&rsquo;s words. Just as if he
were here.</P>

20:19-31</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<H4>God's Gift of Peace</H4>
<P><I>When the last time you truly felt peaceful?</I></P>
<P>Peace is more than a lack of conflict. A lull in action between
two opponents only gives them a chance to regroup, to recharge for
the next round. A void of violence does not lead to happiness.</P>
<P>True peace, on the other hand, gives us happiness, since it is
build on trust. The gospel tells us how Jesus gave his followers
peace because they trusted him. In spite of scepticism, he offers us
the same peace.</P>
<P>In this gospel, John related two resurrection stories and two
verse many scholars believe were the original ending to the gospel.
The first section focused upon the gift of the Spirit, the second
upon faith, and the third upon the reason for evangelization.</P>
<P>20:19 &quot;evening in that first day of the week&quot; is
literally &quot;evening in that day, the first one of the sabbaths.&quot;
The use of the plural &quot;sabbaths&quot; indicates the time frame
of a week.</P>
<P>&quot;(Jewish leaders)&quot; is literally &quot;Jews.&quot; John
used generic language to indicate specific groups within in the
general culture. &quot;Jews&quot; were members of the Jewish
leadership. &quot;Greeks&quot; were the non-Jewish populace (not
people born in Greece).</P>
<P>20:23 This is an extremely awkward set of sentences. The sentences
are literally &quot;Of whomever you might sent away (their) sins,
they have been sent away for them. Of whomever you might hold, they
have been held.&quot;</P>
<P>The key theological phrase is &quot;they have been sent away;&quot;
the verb is in the past tense, indicating the sin had been forgiven
before the pronouncement of the Church.</P>
<P>On the one hand, Jesus already suffered for that particular sin
and all the sins of the world. Hence, the declaration would be a
proclamation of the Good News. (The current form of Sacrament of
Reconciliation stresses this proclamation. In the sacrament, we are
to celebrate God's forgiveness, not our sinfulness.)</P>
<P>On the other hand, the implication of &quot;pre-forgiveness&quot;
might lead to presumption on the part of the sinner or a sense of
blessed predestination. Obviously the former sense is meant, not the
later. God holds everyone responsible for their actions, both of sin
and of faith.</P>
<P>In his gospel, John gave the reason the followers gathered
together behind locked doors. They feared the Jewish leadership. &quot;If
they killed Jesus,&quot; the followers reasoned, &quot;the leadership
would certainly be looking for us.&quot; [20:19a]</P>
<P>Barred doors made Jesus' followers look more suspicious. At the
time, trust within the Jewish community was built upon open access.
Doors were never locked. Neighbor children could enter one's house at
will. Jews lived private lives in the open. Anyone who locked their
doors (save the rural family who lived miles from their neighbor),
cut themselves off from the community.</P>
<P>Suddenly Jesus appeared in the locked room and greeted his
followers with &quot; Shalom.&quot; [20:19b] Shalom (&quot;peace&quot;
in Hebrew) meant God was working in the world. When God worked, he
put the world in balance. No war, no hatred, no cynicism could
overcome God's providence. When God worked, he put the spirit in
balance. No fear, no doubt, no lack of trust could overcome the sheer
joy of God's presence. Shalom meant everything was right in God's
world.</P>
<P>When his followers saw Jesus alive with his deadly wound, they
realized the &quot;Shalom&quot; of Jesus, for they witnessed God's
activity in the world. Fear left them, for now they believed. Joy
entered their hearts. [20:20]</P>
<P>Again Jesus said &quot;Shalom&quot; with a command and a gift. The
command: Go into the world. As the Father send Jesus into the
physical world, Jesus would now send his followers into the cultural
world. [20:21]</P>
<P>With the command came the gift: the Holy Spirit. In Greek (pneuma)
and Hebrew (ruah), the word &quot;spirit&quot; can be translated as
&quot;breath&quot; In 20:22, the word &quot;breathe on&quot; in Greek
can be seen only here and in Genesis 2:7 of the Septuagint (a Greek
translation of the Bible used by the early Church) where God breathed
life into Adam. So, when Jesus breathed on his followers, he gave
them his Spirit. When the followers took in the Spirit, they received
his newly risen life. [20:22]</P>
<P>Now they could obey the missionary command to proclaim repentance
and forgive sin. Jesus told his followers to forgive or retain sin
like a knot loosening or tied closely together. If the followers
forgive, however, they must loosen the sinner from the guilt now and
in the future. Sin was never to be brought up again. [20:23]</P>
<P>Catechism Themes: CCC 645-647</P>
<P>We do not know what Christ's risen body is like. On the one hand,
the risen Jesus could be touched by his followers. His body still had
the wounds of the passion. On the other hand, he entered locked rooms
at will and appeared to his followers as he wished. His body was not
limited by space and time. While his body possessed signs of his
past, it was transformed to a new plane. The body of Christ now
possessed the power of the Spirit.</P>
<P>The resurrection was at once a moment in history two millennium
ago and a moment for all time. That which space and time bound was
raised to the eternal. When we profess Christ is risen, we
acknowledge our faith in a life beyond despite our present
limitations. We can touch that very life through the Spirit. And,
because of the Spirit, our shortcomings that stand in the way of
eternal life can be swept aside.</P>
<P><I>Why does the Christian walk lead through forgiveness to peace?
Have you experienced that road?</I></P>
<P>Preachers have called Thomas the &quot;Doubter.&quot; Few have
touched upon his cynicism. Over and over, Thomas heard the witness of
the followers. But, Thomas wanted more than proof positive. (&quot;Inspect
and touch,&quot; literally meant &quot;to see and thrust.&quot;) He
stepped beyond skepticism into cynicism. [20:24-25]</P>
<P>A week later, Jesus again appear with the greeting of &quot;Shalom.&quot;
Turning to Thomas, Jesus answered the challenge of cynicism with the
challenge of faith. Thomas responded with two titles for Jesus: Lord
and God. Thomas acknowledged the rightful place of Jesus as Lord; he
also saw God working through the Risen Christ. Thomas finally
received Christ's gift of Shalom. [20:26-28]</P>
<P>In contrast to Thomas, Jesus blessed those who believed without
seeing him raised from the dead. [20:29] Here John used the word
&quot;believe&quot; in two senses: to trust (&quot;believe in&quot;)
and to hold onto the truth (&quot;believe (something) about...&quot;).
Blessed were those who placed their personal trust in Christ (believe
in); they do not need proof of his resurrection, for they know he is
alive. But, even blessed are those who hold onto the truths of faith
(believe...about), for, with an open heart, they will soon experience
the risen Christ. Belief in these two sense stood against the
cynicism found in Thomas.</P>

<P>Without the Resurrection, Christianity would be nothing more than
a school that taught the wisdom of a great teacher. With the
Resurrection, however, Christianity became a road to intimacy with
God.</P>
<P>The Resurrection justifies the life, works, and teachings of
Jesus. Through the lens of the Resurrection, we can see this life,
these works and teachings in the context of Scripture and realize
&quot;Jesus is Lord.&quot; Faith in the Resurrection leads us to the
conclusion Jesus is true God and true man.</P>
<P>Through the Resurrection, we receive the gift of a new eternal
life, free from evil. We become one with our Savior who died and rose
for us. And, as he rose, Christ assures us that we, too, will rise on
the last day.</P>
<P><I>How does the cynicism of the world affect you? How does faith
keep you from cynicism?</I></P>
<P>20:31 &quot;you might believe&quot; can also be translated &quot;you
might continue to believe.&quot; John's gospel, then, would not be
for evangelizing the non-Christian, but strengthening the believer.</P>
<P>The peace Christ give us heals the fear and cynicism of the world.
This peace builds bridges of trust and allows us to walk together to
the Father. His peace allows us to continue to believe and to hold on
to his very life. Let us, then, offer each other the peace of Christ,
the Shalom of his Spirit.</P>
<P><I>How can you offer the peace of Christ to others in your daily
life? </I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
gospel text calls Thomas &ldquo;the twin.&rdquo; However, centuries
of Christians have given him the nickname &ldquo;doubting Thomas.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Doubting&rdquo; Thomas often gets a bad rap, not only because
he refuses to believe until he sees for himself, but because of
Jesus&rsquo; word of blessing for those who have come to believe
without seeing. <BR><BR>However, there are two other instances in
John's gospel where Thomas speaks, and neither of them characterizes
Thomas in a bad light. The first is when Jesus is preparing to go to
Lazarus' grave and the disciples hesitate, knowing that Jesus risks
death by returning to Judea, given that they'd just been trying to
kill him. While the others think that going to Bethany is a bad idea,
Thomas bravely says, &quot;let us also go with him, so that we may
die with him&quot; (11:16). Thomas is bold. The second occasion is in
chapter 14, Thomas is the one who says &quot;Lord, we don't know
where you are going, how can we possibly know the way?&quot; (14:5).
John&rsquo;s gospel portrays Thomas as honest and forthright. He is
willing to speak up when he doesn't understand what Jesus is talking
about. He takes following Jesus seriously, and doesn&rsquo;t back
away when it gets dangerous. When people say things that don't make
sense to him, he says so. Thomas needs to see in order to believe.
Jesus meets him where he is&ndash; the following week, again, the
disciples are gathered together and Jesus comes and stands in their
midst. Again, the first words out of his mouth are &lsquo;peace be
with you&quot; then he goes to Thomas and invites him to touch; to
place his hands in his wounds, in order to see and believe.<BR><BR>Seeing
for himself, Thomas does believe, and he confessed his faith in Jesus
as his Lord and God (vs. 28). In chapter 14, when Thomas had said,
&quot;we don't know where you are going, how can we know the way,&quot;
Jesus had said, &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life&quot;
(14:6) Thomas' journey to faith helps us to bring our own
understanding of Jesus into sharper focus. Here, at the end of John&rsquo;s
gospel, we see clearly what that way is. It is the way of the cross.
It is the way of death and resurrection. It is the truth that neither
death nor locked doors, fear nor doubts can keep Jesus from coming
into our midst. And we see that the way of God is peace and
forgiveness, filling us with the Holy Spirit and breathing life into
us. Jesus&rsquo; word of blessing to those who have not seen and yet
have come to believe is not a &ldquo;slam&rdquo; against Thomas and
his need for re-assurance, but are an affirmation for all of us who
come afterwards and believe without having the benefit of being
eyewitnesses. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
