						<h4>The Commission of John the Elder</h4>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>9
I am John, your brother in Jesus. I share your suffering, your place in
God&#8217;s Kingdom, and your patient endurance. I came to a small island
called Patmos because I preached God&#8217;s word and the truth of Jesus.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>10
One Sunday, I felt the Holy Spirit within me. Then I heard someone
behind me speak. He sounded like a loud trumpet blast. 11a &#8220;Write in a
small book everything you see!&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>12
I turned to see the person who spoke. Then, I saw seven gold lamp
stands. 13 In the middle of the stands, I saw someone who looked like
the Son of Man. He wore a long robe that reached his feet and a gold
sash across his chest.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>17 When
I saw him, I fell flat on my face, as if I were dead. He put his right
hand on me and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid! I am the beginning and the end
of everything. 18 I am the Living One! I was dead, but now I am alive
forever! I have complete power over death and those who have died. 19
Write down what you see now and what will happen after this.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>9
I, John, your brother and partner in JESUS, (a partner with you) in the
persecution and the Kingdom and the patient endurance, happened (to
come) to the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the
testimony of JESUS. 10 I happened (to be) in the Spirit on the Lord&#8217;s
day and I heard behind me a loud sound like a trumpet (blast) 11
saying, &#8220;Write in a (small) book what you see and send (it) to the
seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
Philadelphia, and Laodicea.&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>12 I
turned to look (in the direction of) the voice (of the person) which
was speaking to me, and, having turned, I saw seven gold lamp stands,
13 and, in the midst of the lamp stands, (ONE) like the SON OF MAN,
having clothed (in a long vestment that reached) to his feet and,
circling HIS chest, a gold sash. 14 HIS head and hair (were) like white
as wool, white as snow, and HIS eyes (were) as flames of fire, 15 HIS
feet (were) like a polished metal, as (after it was) refined in a
furnace, HIS voice (was) like the sound of many waters (cascading in
torrents), 16 having in HIS hand seven stars and coming (forth) from
HIS mouth (the blade) of a two edged sword, and HIS face (was) like the
sun (as it) shone in its full power.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>17
When I saw HIM, I fell (prostrate) at HIS feet like the dead, and HE
set his right (hand) on me, saying, &#8220;Do not be afraid! I am the first
and the last, 18 the Living One; I was dead and Look! I am alive into
the ages of ages; I have the keys to death and Hades. 19 Write what you
saw, what is (now) and what is to happen after these (events). 20 The
mystery concerning the seven stars which you see on my right, and the
seven gold lamp stands (is this.) The seven stars are the seven
messengers (i.e., angels) to the seven churches, and the seven lamp
stands are the seven churches.&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="indent"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">1:12
&#8220;gold lamp stands&#8221; were gold plated stands that held clay bowls filled
with olive oil. The bowl had a spout at an end with a wick. The oil fed
the flame at the wick. The stands evoke the seven flame menorahs of the
Temple (Exodus 21:35-40), or in the vision of the prophet Zechariah
(Zechariah 4:1-2).</span></p>
						<p class="indent"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">1:13
&#8220;(one) like the son of man&#8221; The phrase &#8220;son of man&#8221; had a generic sense
and a particularly religious sense. In the generic sense, it meant &#8220; a
common human being.&#8221; In the religious sense, it had the overtones of
the heavenly figure in Daniel 7:13. Jesus slid between both senses as
he used the title to refer to himself; he was like everyone else and he
was God&#8217;s chosen. John seemed to use the phrase in the same way.</span></p>
						<p class="indent"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">&#8220;gold
sash&#8221; could also be &#8220;gold belt.&#8221; The sash could have been colored like
gold or made from threads of gold. A metal belt made of pure gold
seemed less likely.</span></p>
						<p class="indent"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">1:15 &#8220;polished metal&#8221; The type of metal is unknown. Most translators use &#8220;bronze,&#8221; &#8220;brass,&#8221; or &#8220;precious metal.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
the Book of Revelation, John the Elder received a commission to write.
What he wrote and how he wrote has caused much controversy and
confusion over the past two millennia.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
commission John received had three parts: the voice announcing the
command to write, the presence of the One giving the command, and
restatement of the command with a revelation.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">After
the opening greeting, the author John justified his message to the
seven churches and his vision of the end times in three ways: empathy
with fellow believers, spiritual activity, and a commission. First,
John identified himself as an equal, not only in his place within the
Church, but his place with those suffering persecution. Notice the
tension between the three elements he shared with those in the
churches; the presence of the Kingdom connected suffering in the
persecution with patient endurance for the coming of the Lord in glory.
It was the partial realized nature of the Kingdom that allowed the
communities to suffer the wrath of the outside with anticipation of the
Second Coming. [1:9a]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">John&#8217;s empathy did
not end when he identified with their situation. He pointed out his
geography. He was on Patmos, a tiny island (five miles wide by eight
miles long) in the Aegean Sea off the coast of modern-day Turkey. He
was in the vicinity. While we do not know if John was somehow
persecuted for his activities (&#8220;preaching God&#8217;s word and the truth of
Jesus&#8221;), we can imagine John felt he walked with those in seven
assemblies. (Later, about 190 A.D., Clement of Alexandria, in The Rich
Man&#8217;s Salvation, wrote John was exiled on Patmos for his preaching.)</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Second,
John &#8220;was in the Spirit on the Lord&#8217;s Day.&#8221; The result of the Spirit&#8217;s
activity was a voice of commission [10b-11] and a vision of the Lord
[12-20]. What did John mean when he said he was &#8220;in the Spirit.&#8221; Many
commentators assume John was in a trance. But John did not emphasize
his duty as a writer of visions but a recorder of prophecies (see 1:3).
His model of prophecy was obviously Daniel. In a movement that
anticipated the immanent return of the Lord, the utterance of prophecy
might commonly take the shape of &#8220;apocalyptic&#8221; visions. In 1
Corinthians 12:9, Paul listed prophecy as one of the many gifts of the
Spirit given to the community. Add to the mix that John might have been
with the assembly at worship &#8220;on the Lord&#8217;s day.&#8221; We can just as easily
speculate John recorded the prophetic utterance of the community on
Patmos as he was alone in a complete trance. In the end, we do not know
how John received the vision, we just have the end result. [1:10a]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Third,
in the prophecy, John heard a voice from heaven that commissioned him
to write what he witnessed. The loud sound of the trumpet could
represent a call to worship as much as a commission. As we will see,
who John saw when he turned to see the source of the voiced caused him
to fall prostate in worship (see 1:17a). In the commission, the voice
commanded John to write to the seven churches in Asia Minor (modern day
Turkey), within several days journey from Patmos. While the author
listed specific churches, the number seven represented the fullness of
the Christian experience in community. In other words, the praises and
curses found in Revelations could be applied to any group of church
communities. [1:11]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">After John turned to
see the source of the voice, he gazed within the temple of heaven,
decorated with lamp stands. In the midst stood &#8220;one like the Son of
Man.&#8221; Notice the appearance of the figure projected the power of God.
The man was clothed in official (even priestly) vestments accented in
gold. His hair was white to denote age, wisdom, and power. His eyes
were intense and his voice had a commanding projection (water in
torrents) with the power of judgment (tongue like a two-edged sword).
His face shone like the sun, denoting a divine presence (as in the
Transfiguration; see Matthew 17:1-9). And in his hand, he held the
power of the cosmos (the seven stars). Taking the lamp stands and the
figure together, we have a vision of the heavenly court, where God&#8217;s
chosen would pronounce his judgment on the world (see the dream in
Daniel 10:5-14).</p>
						<p class="bodytext">John reacted to the
vision of the &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; by falling prostrate in fear and worship.
Compare this scene to Matthew 28:2-3, where the angel appeared white as
lightning and the guards fell prostrate as dead men (also see Daniel
8:17, 10:9-11). While the sight of the divine caused fear and
trembling, in the Spirit, it also caused praise. [1;17a-b]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
response, the Son of Man comforted John (again compare with Matthew
17:9). Then he declared who he was as a prelude to the his revelation.
Notice again the three part construction where the dissimilar middle
element bridged two like elements on either side. In the middle, the
Son of Man revealed himself as the risen Jesus (&#8220;I was dead and Look! I
am alive into the ages of ages&#8221;). On either side of this element laid
the announcement of his divinity. The first element echoed the words
and phrasing of 1:9: the beginning and the end (the Alpha and the
Omega) and the Living One. The last element stated his power; with
control over death and the after-world, the Lord was almighty.
[1:17c-18]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">This three element
construction also carried through this section. The vision-declaration
of divinity (1:12-18) has two bookend command elements (&#8220;Write...&#8221;).
The first command to write told John the addresses of his
correspondence. Now, the Lord commanded John to write what he saw, both
present and future events. [1:19]</p>
						<p class="bodytext">After
the vision and the declaration came the revelation: the meaning of the
gold stands and the stars. The gold stands as signs of worship in the
Temple were symbolized in the seven churches, the assemblies where the
faithful praised God for gift of Jesus. The seven stars were the angels
(i.e., power of God&#8217;s message) to the churches. In the first century
A.D., the stars were commonly seen as the instruments that held the
divine will. Notice the lamp stands and the stars pointed heavenward.
Again, the communities worshiped as if they were in the assembly of the
saved before the throne of God.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
company of angels and before the Son of Man, John was to write prophecy
to the seven churches. He empathized with their condition. And he
shared with their worship in &#8220;Spirit.&#8221; His words were from the Lord, to
challenge the complacent and comfort the persecuted.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">This
is the essence of prophecy. It is our mission to prophecy in the Lord&#8217;s
name and in the Lord&#8217;s words. Just as if he were here.</p>
