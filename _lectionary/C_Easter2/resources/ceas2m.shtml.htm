<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 5:27-32</strong>
<p>Peter and John have been arrested by the religious authorities for
teaching and proclaiming that &#8220;in Jesus there is resurrection of the
dead&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+4%3A2">4:2</a>). The Sanhedrin has ordered them 
&#8220;not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+4%3A18">4:18</a>).
So popular are they with the people that the Sanhedrin does not punish
them. But later the growth in believers leads the high priest to take
further action; he and the Sadducees see the disciples doing what they
cannot do, i.e. healing the sick. This time, all the apostles are
imprisoned; however, a divine messenger sets them free (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A19">19</a>). They go right back to preaching 
&#8211; in the outer court of the Temple (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A21">21</a>). The temple police bring them to 
appear before the council.</p>
<p>Now the high priest imputes that the apostles place the blame for
Jesus&#8217; death on the religious authorities (&#8220;you are determined ...&#8221;, v.
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A28">28</a>). Led by Peter, they insist that 
they must obey God&#8217;s will rather than the Sanhedrin&#8217;s orders (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A29">29</a>). They explain in Jewish terms: 
the &#8220;God of our ancestors&#8221; (v.

is the God of Israel (and of Christians): he has &#8220;raised&#8221; Jesus from
the dead. The Law prescribed that a person guilty of a capital offence
be hanged &#8220;on a tree&#8221;; Peter interprets <em>cross</em> as being the Roman equivalent to the Jewish <em>tree</em>. 
Moses was &#8220;Leader and Saviour&#8221; (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A31">31</a>) of Israel, under God; Jesus is 
much more so: he <em>goes before us</em>;
now with the Father, he continues to rescue us from sin and death.
Jesus&#8217; message was first to &#8220;Israel&#8221;. Both the apostles and the &#8220;Holy
Spirit&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A32">32</a>), given to the faithful, are 
&#8220;witnesses&#8221; to Christ&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>The council members are so enraged that they want to kill Peter, but
a famous liberal rabbi, Gamaliel, cautions them: &#8220;if this ... is of
human origin, it will fail&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A38">38</a>); but if it is from God, they 
&#8220;will not be able to overthrow them&#8221; (v.

and they will be working against God. Peter and John are flogged for
their earlier offence. Despite being ordered not to preach the Good
News, the apostles continue to do so, both in the Temple and in homes.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>Revelation</b>
</small><p>
<small>This is the last book of the Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of 
the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future and 
presents an understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle between good 
and evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic language, 
its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of persecution. It is 
hard to understand because we do not know the meaning of the symbols (e.g. 
animals) it uses.

Asia being a Roman province in western Asia Minor, but &#8220;seven&#8221;

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in

&#8220;breathed&#8221; life into Adam, the <em>proto-human</em>,
