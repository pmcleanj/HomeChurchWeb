<B>Acts</B>
<P>
This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 John</B>
<P>
This epistle was addressed to a general audience, unlike those written by Paul. 
It shares a style, phrases and expressions with the Gospel according to John, so 
it is very likely that both were written by the same person. It appears to have 
been circulated to various churches. The author seeks to combat heresy, specifically 
that the spirit is entirely good but matter is entirely evil. John tells his readers 
that morality and ethical behaviour are important for Christians.

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<STRONG>John 10:11-18</STRONG>
<P>Jesus continues to speak of himself as the good shepherd, an image familiar to his audience. True followers, he has said, recognize the good shepherd. &#8220;I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved ... and find pasture ... the thief 
comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have [spiritual] life, and have it abundantly&#8221; (vv.

real, proper) &#8220;shepherd&#8221;, the one who dies for his &#8220;sheep&#8221;, his flock. But the &#8220;hired hand&#8221; (v.

sheep from the &#8220;wolf&#8221;. (Old Testament prophets spoke of leaders of Israel in these terms, so Jesus probably speaks of them here &#8211; shepherds who are not worthy of the name.) Jesus&#8217; relationship to people is like the 
Father&#8217;s to him (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+10%3A15" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>). Who
