Last Week</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Last week's lessons
focused on:</B> trust and witness. The courage to speak out, the
right words to say, the Spirit that guides us &ndash; these are of
God. Our personal experiences are the substance that give our witness
immediacy and personal commitment.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>What was the sermon on?</B>
- Learning to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to bad choices: not just to things
that are wrong for us, but also to things that are second-best. God's
plan for us is for the best.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>What was the Gospel
lesson?</B> - Jesus appears to the gathered disciples, after the two
from the Road to Emmaus return to tell their story. He eats a piece
of fish, and shows that he is not a ghost but is bodily resurrected;
and explains that he is the fulfillment of the Scriptures.</P>

passage follows on from last week's passage: Peter and John had
healed a man at the Temple, and had preached that the healing was
from Jesus, who is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. Now they are
brought before the temple authorities to defend that witness &ndash;
and again the Spirit gives them the words.</FONT></P>

the Rod and Staff &ndash; the shepherd uses these to defend and

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
