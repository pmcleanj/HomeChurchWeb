<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples. 

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Isaiah 55:1-9</strong>
<p>This chapter concludes a section of the book called <em>Second Isaiah</em> 
by many scholars. It was written during the Exile, after the fall of Babylon to 
the Persians. This section began with Chapter 40, and key themes presented 
there are repeated here: the way of the Lord, calling the people to enjoy 
God&#8217;s gifts, a new deliverance, the word of the Lord, the king, heaven 
and earth, God&#8217;s relationship with Israel, forgiveness, and the 
participation of other nations.</p>
<p>Vv. 1-3 invite all <em>who thirst</em> for God (even the impoverished) to 
join in his freely-given banquet at the end of time. The meal symbolizes 
God&#8217;s love, his abundance. Recall other banquets: </p>
<ls>
<li>in Egypt, after a plague killed every first-born son but <em>passed 
over</em> (did not afflict) Israelite sons; and </li>
<li>after Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai.</li>
</ls>
<p> Here the banquet is for &#8220;everyone&#8221;. The food is both invaluable 
(&#8220;without price&#8221;) and cannot be bought (&#8220;without 
money&#8221;). God made an &#8220;everlasting covenant&#8221; (v. 3) with 
David, making him a great leader and guaranteeing him an enduring line of 
successors (v. 6); now this greatness is transferred to Israel, so that they 
&#8220;may live&#8221; (v. 3), i.e. see the promises of long ago fulfilled now 
and in the future. Now nations who neither know Israel nor are known to her 
will come seeking Israel&#8217;s &#8220; L<small>ORD</small>&#8221; (v. 5). All 
may now &#8220;seek the L<small>ORD</small>&#8221; (v. 6), turn humbly to him, 
not only in the Temple but wherever he may be found, for &#8220;he is 
near&#8221;. The invitation to share in the life of this new community is even 
extended to evildoers who repent and &#8220;return to the Lord&#8221; (v. 7), 
for they will be pardoned. God may be &#8220;near&#8221; but he is 
transcendent, sufficiently removed not to be contaminated by human sin. His 
ways are beyond human comprehension (vv. 8-9). Vv. 10-11 say that God&#8217;s 
<em>word</em> comes gently from him, to permeate the earth and return to him, 
mission done. His spirit, infused in humans, brings in them godliness, success 
in furthering God&#8217;s plan. Vv. 12-13 say that sin will be abolished; all 
the world will recognize God; creation will be renewed, and all will rejoice. 
This will be an &#8220;everlasting sign&#8221; of God&#8217;s love.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<hr>
<strong>Psalm 63:1-8</strong>
<p>The psalmist is now separated from God; he remembers him nostalgically; it 
is as though he is out in the lifeless desert. He recalls encountering God in 
the Temple (&#8220;sanctuary&#8221;, v. 2). Much as he values life itself as 
God&#8217;s great gift, God&#8217;s &#8220;steadfast love&#8221; (v. 3), his 
fidelity in keeping the covenant, is even greater (v. 3). He will 
&#8220;bless&#8221; (v. 4, honour) God throughout his life. The abundance God 
has given him is like a &#8220;rich feast&#8221; (v. 5). He enjoys an intimate 
relationship with God: his &#8220;soul clings&#8221; (v. 8) to God. God has 
helped him and protected him (&#8220;wings&#8221;, v. 7). God provides his 
strength (&#8220;right hand&#8221;, v. 8). In vv. 9-10, he asks God to destroy, 
annihilate, those who seek to make his life worthless; may they be destroyed 
without being buried (&#8220;prey for jackals&#8221;). May the 
&#8220;king&#8221; (v. 11, the guarantor of safety for all, and the defender of 
the oppressed), and all the godly, be joyful at the conquest over the ungodly 
(&#8220;liars&#8221;).</p>

<b>1 Corinthians</b> 
</small><p>
<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD. 

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>1 Corinthians 10:1-13</strong>
<p>Paul warns Christians at Corinth that some of them are not on the path to 
eternal life: &#8220;if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not 
fall&#8221;! (v. 12) He uses events from the Exodus to illustrate their plight: 
the Israelites were the Church&#8217;s spiritual &#8220;ancestors&#8221; (v. 
1); they too were under God&#8217;s protection (&#8220;under the cloud&#8221;). 
Stretching the metaphor, they were &#8220;baptised&#8221; (v. 2) in passing 
through the Reed (Red) Sea. Their &#8220;spiritual food&#8221; (v. 3) was 
manna; ours is the bread of the Eucharist. Their &#8220;spiritual drink&#8221; 
(v. 4) was the water from the rock. Now Christ gives to us; back in 
Moses&#8217; day, the rock gave to them: hence &#8220;the rock was 
Christ&#8221;. Further, as the rock was with them, Christ is with us. (A Jewish 
legend says that the rock &#8220;followed them&#8221;.) Even so, Paul says, God 
showed his anger to many of them, by killing them. To him, these events 
happened (&#8220;occurred&#8221;, v. 6) and &#8220;were written down&#8221; (v. 
11) so we may avoid evil ways: do not &#8220;play&#8221; (v. 7), i.e. 
&#8220;indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did&#8221; (v. 8); do not 
test God (by your self-centeredness). When many Israelites tested God (by 
complaining about the food he provided), they were &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (vv. 
9-10). (Rabbis believed that a special angel, &#8220;the destroyer&#8221; 
existed.) We live in the last era (&#8220;ages&#8221;, v. 11) of human history. 
The &#8220;testing&#8221; (v. 13) some Corinthians have failed is what humans 
normally endure; you could have resisted, for God does not test us beyond what 
we can bear.</p>

</small></center>
<small><br>
<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. 
Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his 
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of 
sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes 
God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and 
lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses 
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Luke 13:1-9</strong>
<p>Jesus has said that he will return to judge humankind at an unexpected time. 
Those who know of Christ&#8217;s coming and use what God gives wisely will be 
rewarded with God&#8217;s abundance. Those who know but do not prepare will be 
condemned. Those who do not know and behave wantonly will be lightly 
reprimanded. (12:35-48).</p>
<p>It was commonly believed that pain and premature death were signs of 
God&#8217;s adverse judgement. Now we read of two events where people died 
prematurely and unexpectedly: one group (&#8220;the Galileans&#8221;, v. 1) 
doing God&#8217;s will, killed intentionally as they sacrifice to him in the 
Temple; the other group (&#8220;those eighteen&#8221;, v. 4, possibly 
construction workers) killed accidentally. In both cases, Jesus says, there is 
no link between early death and sin; however, these deaths do show the fate of 
those who fail to &#8220;repent&#8221; (vv. 3, 5), to turn to God.</p>
<p>In the parable (vv. 6-9), Jesus elaborates on his call for repentance. (The 
fig tree symbolizes some Jews, possibly the religious leaders.) Jesus expects 
those who hear him to <em>bear fruit</em> (v. 9), to do his will. If they do 
not do so immediately, God in his mercy gives them some extra time (&#8220;one 
more year&#8221;, v. 8) to do so. If they still fail to do so, they will be 
destroyed.</p>
