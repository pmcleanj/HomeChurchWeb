						<h4>Blessings and Warnings</h4>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>1
Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that our ancestors traveled
under a cloud and through the sea all together. 2 In the cloud and the
sea, they were all &#8220;baptized&#8221; and became followers of Moses. 3 All of
them ate the same spiritual food and 4 drank the same spiritual drink.
They drank water from the same spiritual rock that followed them. That
rock was Christ. 5 But God wasn&#8217;t pleased with them, because they died
all over the desert. 6 This is a warning to us so we won&#8217;t want to do
evil things just like they did.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>10
Don&#8217;t grumble like they did. They were killed by a dark angel. 11 All
this happened around the same time as an example. It was written in the
Bible as a warning for us who live in last days of the world. 12 So,
this is a message to the person who thinks he can stand against these
problems. Watch out! Otherwise you will fail.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>1
Now, I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under a
cloud and all went through the sea, 2 and all were baptized into Moses
in the cloud and in the sea, 3 and all ate the same spiritual food, 4
and all drank the same spiritual drink. For, they drank from the
spiritual rock following (them), but the rock was the Christ. 5 But,
God did not think much of most of them, for they were overthrown in the
desert. 6 These (things) became our (negative) impressions, for us not
to be desirous of evil, just as they desired.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>10
Do not grumble, just like some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by
the Destroyer. 11 But, these (things) happened together to them as a
(negative) impression, but it was written for our admonition, upon whom
the completion of the age has arrived. 12 So, the (one) thinking to
stand up (as righteous), let (him) look out, lest he might fall.</b></p>
						<p class="indent">10:1-4a
Paul interpreted the history of Israel as midrash. This form of
interpretation focused on the meanings of individual words and
grammatical forms, while it used one verse to interpret another. The
lense for interpretation was the rabbinical tradition of teachings. The
images of the cloud, the sea, the manna, and the water from the rock
could be found in Psalms 78 and 106, Nehemiah 9:9-21.</p>
						<p class="indent">Paul
chose these images in their relation to Christian worship. The cloud
was like the incense found in the Temple; it was a sign of divine
presence. The sea/water and spiritual food were sacramental images for
Baptism and Eucharist.</p>
						<p class="indent">1:3c &#8220; but the rock
was the Christ&#8221; Paul wove two images for "rock" together. The
permanence and stability of God were rock-like (Deuteronomy 32:4; 2
Samuel 22:2; Psalms 18:2; 71:3). But Moses gave the Israelites water
from a rock (Exodus 17:6); Paul used this as a baptismal image for the
Corinthians. Together, Paul implied that the permanence and life-giving
qualities of the Christ.</p>
						<p class="indent">1:6, 11
&#8220;(negative) impression&#8221; This word in Greek referred to the impression a
stamp made by a die. The word could also be translated as &#8220;example&#8221; or
&#8220;warning.&#8221;</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In these verses, Paul listed
the blessings upon and the evil deeds of the Israelites in the Exodus.
In doing so, Paul used the Exodus as an example that had parallels with
the community he wrote to. The Corinthians had been blessed with
salvation (notice the images of divine presence and sacrament found in
10:1-4a), but now they grumbled and bickered, as cliques within the
community squabbled for power. By making the parallel, Paul warned the
faithful at Corinth not to become presumptuous. They, too, could suffer
the same fate as the Israelites.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Our
attitude reveals our spiritual direction. We have blessings that will
never end. But, do we take our blessings for granted? Do we complain
when we do not think we have enough? Those who walked with God and saw
him in action failed the test in many ways. How do we measure up?</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>Take
time this week for an honest self-evaluation. Do you grumble too much
in your spiritual life? Do put your complaints before the Lord. But
take time to listen to God.</i></p>
