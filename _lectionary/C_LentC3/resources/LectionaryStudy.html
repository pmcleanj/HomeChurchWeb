<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Isaiah </B></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This book can be divided into two (and possibly
three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before the exile, from
about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult times for the
southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought with Syria; the
Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and
threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly.
Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon.
They are filled with a message of trust and confident hope that God
will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to
66 form a third part of the book, written after the return to the
Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and despair; they berate
the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second
Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Isaiah 55:1-9</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>This chapter concludes a section of the book called <EM>Second
Isaiah</EM> by many scholars. It was written during the Exile, after
the fall of Babylon to the Persians. This section began with Chapter
40, and key themes presented there are repeated here: the way of the
Lord, calling the people to enjoy God&rsquo;s gifts, a new
deliverance, the word of the Lord, the king, heaven and earth, God&rsquo;s
relationship with Israel, forgiveness, and the participation of other
nations.</P>
<P>Vv. 1-3 invite all <EM>who thirst</EM> for God (even the
impoverished) to join in his freely-given banquet at the end of time.
The meal symbolizes God&rsquo;s love, his abundance. Recall other
banquets: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in Egypt, after a plague killed
	every first-born son but <EM>passed over</EM> (did not afflict)
	Israelite sons; and 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>after Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Here the banquet is for &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;. The food is both
invaluable (&ldquo;without price&rdquo;) and cannot be bought
(&ldquo;without money&rdquo;). God made an &ldquo;everlasting
covenant&rdquo; (v. 3) with David, making him a great leader and
guaranteeing him an enduring line of successors (v. 6); now this
greatness is transferred to Israel, so that they &ldquo;may live&rdquo;
(v. 3), i.e. see the promises of long ago fulfilled now and in the
future. Now nations who neither know Israel nor are known to her will
come seeking Israel&rsquo;s &ldquo; L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>&rdquo;
(v. 5). All may now &ldquo;seek the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>&rdquo;
(v. 6), turn humbly to him, not only in the Temple but wherever he
may be found, for &ldquo;he is near&rdquo;. The invitation to share
in the life of this new community is even extended to evildoers who
repent and &ldquo;return to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 7), for they will be
pardoned. God may be &ldquo;near&rdquo; but he is transcendent,
sufficiently removed not to be contaminated by human sin. His ways
are beyond human comprehension (vv. 8-9). Vv. 10-11 say that God&rsquo;s
<EM>word</EM> comes gently from him, to permeate the earth and return
to him, mission done. His spirit, infused in humans, brings in them
godliness, success in furthering God&rsquo;s plan. Vv. 12-13 say that
sin will be abolished; all the world will recognize God; creation
will be renewed, and all will rejoice. This will be an &ldquo;everlasting
sign&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s love.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#c00000">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>TENDING
THE GARDEN OF GRACE&rdquo; </B></FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
is an amazing painting by the Reformation artist Lucas Cranach that
hangs in St. Marys in Wittenberg, Germany. I was part of a PLU Travel
Seminar that was in Wittenberg on Reformation Day this past fall. Our
guide was taking us on a tour of the town church where Luther often
preached, and pointed out a significant piece of art that portrayed
the church as a garden or a vineyard. The painting is divided into
two segments. On the left we see a vineyard which is in ruin, full of
weeds and stones and part of it is in flames. Here the Pope and his
minions (bishops, priests, and other religious leaders of the day)
are busy destroying what was once a beautiful garden setting. On the
right, however, is a vineyard that is flourishing and bearing much
fruit. We see Martin Luther and other reformers tending to the vines
with great care, fertilizing and watering them with the Word of God.
They are, in fact, nourishing God&rsquo;s garden of grace.<BR><BR>This
is a wonderful illustration that captures the spirit of the texts for
the Third Sunday in Lent. For these are lessons that bear a message
of grace, mercy, and repentance&mdash;all central themes to our
Lenten journey. And as we ruminate particularly on Jesus&rsquo;
parable of the fig tree, it becomes important to note that whether it
be a fig tree or a grapevine, the lack of fruit does not appear to be
solely the fault of the plant. It depends as much or more on good
growing conditions and the care of the gardener&mdash;and in the case
of the parable, on the second chance the gardener gives it to produce
fruit the following year. In the Cranach painting, we note that those
vines that are under the care of the Pope and the leaders of the
Roman church don&rsquo;t have much of a chance to bear fruit. In
fact, they are literally dying on the vine and are being thrown into
the fires of judgment and damnation. Whereas, the plants that are
receiving the tender loving care of Luther and the Reformers are
doing well. They are thriving in a climate of gospel and grace. <BR><BR>The
parable from Luke demonstrates a healthy interdependence between the
fig tree, the gardener, and the owner. Jesus implies that the fig
tree is the believer&mdash;who is dependent upon the care of the
gardener (the disciples and religious leaders) to provide the right
conditions for growth. The gardener depends on the owner (God) to
allow another year for the tree to be nourished in hopes that it will
produce fruit. And the gardener also depends on the fig tree to
blossom and grow and bear fruit. <BR><BR>The grace shown by the
owner, first by allowing it to stand for three years, and then by
giving the gardener one more year demonstrates the importance of the
fig tree to the owner and of each person to God. For we are as
dependent on God&rsquo;s mercy and grace in Jesus Christ as the fig
tree is on the mercy of the owner and the gardener. We depend daily
on God to give us what we need both physically and spiritually. We
look to our baptism daily to remind us of God&rsquo;s forgiveness and
love in spite of our faithlessness and our barren lives. We look to
Jesus Christ to save us from our inability to love as we ought or our
failure to practice generosity, patience, and kindness in our daily
relationships. Just as God gave the Israelites numerous chances to
repent, we too are dependent on God to give us yet another chance&mdash;to
spare us from the axe that would cut us down. <BR><BR>One of my
favorite movies of this past year was Sea Biscuit, the story of a
discarded horse that helped salvage the lives of three misfits (a
jockey, horse trainer, and owner). Like the fig tree, the animal and
these men were given a second chance. Sea Biscuit became the unlikely
hero whose come from behind victories brought out their personal
best. In one scene the horse&rsquo;s jockey confronts the skeptics
saying: &ldquo;He was down but not out. He was a little guy that
didn&rsquo;t think like a little guy.&rdquo; Then quoting
Shakespeare, he says: &ldquo;Though he be but little, he is fierce.&rdquo;
In the end, this became a parable of grace and redemption. For an
entire country that had been plunged into despair because of the
Great Depression, it was a true story that gave many hope and
encouragement for the future.<BR><BR>God also wishes for us to grow
and thrive and claim our future as beloved children of God. During
this Lenten season, we are reminded to turn our hearts back to God
and to follow Jesus. IF we do not do this&mdash;if we do not bear the
fruit of Christ&rsquo;s spirit in our lives&mdash;we risk judgment
and separation from God both now and in the life to come. Yet we know
that God will show us grace, just as he did for the fig tree.
However, we must not take that grace for granted. We respond to God&rsquo;s
grace and mercy&mdash;God&rsquo;s offer of a second chance&mdash;by
bearing much fruit. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
prophet Isaiah issues an invitation on God&rsquo;s behalf to the
people of Israel in our first reading. God invites the thirsty and
the poor to an abundant banquet for which no one has to work but
which God is giving out of generosity. Isaiah invites Israel to
return to God and listen so that they might live. We are reminded of
the passage from Joel that begins this Lenten season on Ash
Wednesday: &ldquo;Return to the Lord, your God, for God is gracious
and merciful.&rdquo; Such grace is offered here as God promises to
restore a nation that has turned away and gone its own way&mdash;if
only they will repent and turn again toward God. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<P><STRONG>Psalm 63:1-8</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The psalmist is now separated from God; he remembers him
nostalgically; it is as though he is out in the lifeless desert. He
recalls encountering God in the Temple (&ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo;, v.
2). Much as he values life itself as God&rsquo;s great gift, God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;steadfast love&rdquo; (v. 3), his fidelity in keeping the
covenant, is even greater (v. 3). He will &ldquo;bless&rdquo; (v. 4,
honour) God throughout his life. The abundance God has given him is
like a &ldquo;rich feast&rdquo; (v. 5). He enjoys an intimate
relationship with God: his &ldquo;soul clings&rdquo; (v. 8) to God.
God has helped him and protected him (&ldquo;wings&rdquo;, v. 7). God
provides his strength (&ldquo;right hand&rdquo;, v. 8). In vv. 9-10,
he asks God to destroy, annihilate, those who seek to make his life
worthless; may they be destroyed without being buried (&ldquo;prey
for jackals&rdquo;). May the &ldquo;king&rdquo; (v. 11, the guarantor
of safety for all, and the defender of the oppressed), and all the
godly, be joyful at the conquest over the ungodly (&ldquo;liars&rdquo;).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1 Corinthians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the
land route from the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An
industrial and ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the
arts. Its inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul
answers two letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and
internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded.
Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57
AD. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>1 Corinthians 10:1-13</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul warns Christians at Corinth that some of them are not on the
path to eternal life: &ldquo;if you think you are standing, watch out
that you do not fall&rdquo;! (v. 12) He uses events from the Exodus
to illustrate their plight: the Israelites were the Church&rsquo;s
spiritual &ldquo;ancestors&rdquo; (v. 1); they too were under God&rsquo;s
protection (&ldquo;under the cloud&rdquo;). Stretching the metaphor,
they were &ldquo;baptised&rdquo; (v. 2) in passing through the Reed
(Red) Sea. Their &ldquo;spiritual food&rdquo; (v. 3) was manna; ours
is the bread of the Eucharist. Their &ldquo;spiritual drink&rdquo;
(v. 4) was the water from the rock. Now Christ gives to us; back in
Moses&rsquo; day, the rock gave to them: hence &ldquo;the rock was
Christ&rdquo;. Further, as the rock was with them, Christ is with us.
(A Jewish legend says that the rock &ldquo;followed them&rdquo;.)
Even so, Paul says, God showed his anger to many of them, by killing
them. To him, these events happened (&ldquo;occurred&rdquo;, v. 6)
and &ldquo;were written down&rdquo; (v. 11) so we may avoid evil
ways: do not &ldquo;play&rdquo; (v. 7), i.e. &ldquo;indulge in sexual
immorality as some of them did&rdquo; (v. 8); do not test God (by
your self-centeredness). When many Israelites tested God (by
complaining about the food he provided), they were &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo;
(vv. 9-10). (Rabbis believed that a special angel, &ldquo;the
destroyer&rdquo; existed.) We live in the last era (&ldquo;ages&rdquo;,
v. 11) of human history. The &ldquo;testing&rdquo; (v. 13) some
Corinthians have failed is what humans normally endure; you could
have resisted, for God does not test us beyond what we can bear.</P>

warns the Corinthians against using the grace of Jesus Christ as a
warrant for rejecting the law completely and living lives full of
immorality (consider the popes and religious leaders of medieval
days!) The Corinthians apparently feel immune to the consequences of
the law, believing that God&rsquo;s mercy will apply to them
regardless of whether or not they are repentant. Paul uses an example
from Israel&rsquo;s history, reminding the Corinthians of the exodus
when God was not pleased with the Israelites behavior and struck many
of them dead for their disobedience. Paul reasons that if those God
chose and accompanied through the desert were not immune to God&rsquo;s
wrath, why should the early Christians in Corinth believe that are
immune from punishment? Paul cautions them against committing sins of
idolatry, sexual immorality, putting Christ to the test, and
complaining. At the same time, Paul reminds them&mdash;and us&mdash;that
the promise of God is faithful and will not let the temptations
overwhelm them or us. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H4>Blessings and Warnings</H4>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>10:1-4a Paul interpreted the history of Israel as
midrash. This form of interpretation focused on the meanings of
individual words and grammatical forms, while it used one verse to
interpret another. The lense for interpretation was the rabbinical
tradition of teachings. The images of the cloud, the sea, the manna,
and the water from the rock could be found in Psalms 78 and 106,
Nehemiah 9:9-21.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Paul chose these images in their relation to
Christian worship. The cloud was like the incense found in the
Temple; it was a sign of divine presence. The sea/water and spiritual
food were sacramental images for Baptism and Eucharist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>1:3c &ldquo; but the rock was the Christ&rdquo; Paul
wove two images for &quot;rock&quot; together. The permanence and
stability of God were rock-like (Deuteronomy 32:4; 2 Samuel 22:2;
Psalms 18:2; 71:3). But Moses gave the Israelites water from a rock
(Exodus 17:6); Paul used this as a baptismal image for the
Corinthians. Together, Paul implied that the permanence and
life-giving qualities of the Christ.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>1:6, 11 &ldquo;(negative) impression&rdquo; This word
in Greek referred to the impression a stamp made by a die. The word
could also be translated as &ldquo;example&rdquo; or &ldquo;warning.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P>In these verses, Paul listed the blessings upon and the evil deeds
of the Israelites in the Exodus. In doing so, Paul used the Exodus as
an example that had parallels with the community he wrote to. The
Corinthians had been blessed with salvation (notice the images of
divine presence and sacrament found in 10:1-4a), but now they
grumbled and bickered, as cliques within the community squabbled for
power. By making the parallel, Paul warned the faithful at Corinth
not to become presumptuous. They, too, could suffer the same fate as
the Israelites.</P>
<P>Our attitude reveals our spiritual direction. We have blessings
that will never end. But, do we take our blessings for granted? Do we
complain when we do not think we have enough? Those who walked with
God and saw him in action failed the test in many ways. How do we
measure up?</P>
<P><I>Take time this week for an honest self-evaluation. Do you
grumble too much in your spiritual life? Do put your complaints
before the Lord. But take time to listen to God.</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological)
gospel in the New Testament. Its author, traditionally Luke the
physician who accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys,
draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of sayings
(known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own source. It is a gospel
that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged,
minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent
part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses Semitic words; this
is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>

<P><STRONG>Luke 13:1-9</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus has said that he will return to judge humankind at an
unexpected time. Those who know of Christ&rsquo;s coming and use what
God gives wisely will be rewarded with God&rsquo;s abundance. Those
who know but do not prepare will be condemned. Those who do not know
and behave wantonly will be lightly reprimanded. (12:35-48).</P>
<P>It was commonly believed that pain and premature death were signs
of God&rsquo;s adverse judgement. Now we read of two events where
people died prematurely and unexpectedly: one group (&ldquo;the
Galileans&rdquo;, v. 1) doing God&rsquo;s will, killed intentionally
as they sacrifice to him in the Temple; the other group (&ldquo;those
eighteen&rdquo;, v. 4, possibly construction workers) killed
accidentally. In both cases, Jesus says, there is no link between
early death and sin; however, these deaths do show the fate of those
who fail to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (vv. 3, 5), to turn to God.</P>
<P>In the parable (vv. 6-9), Jesus elaborates on his call for
repentance. (The fig tree symbolizes some Jews, possibly the
religious leaders.) Jesus expects those who hear him to <EM>bear
fruit</EM> (v. 9), to do his will. If they do not do so immediately,
God in his mercy gives them some extra time (&ldquo;one more year&rdquo;,
v. 8) to do so. If they still fail to do so, they will be destroyed.</P>

Luke provides us with more examples of the need for repentance. He
mentions two episodes of calamity and suffering: Pilate&rsquo;s
cruelty of mingling the blood of the Galileans with their sacrifices
and the collapse of the tower of Siloam. Jesus comments that the
people who perished in both cases were no worse sinners than anyone
else. His point is not God&rsquo;s judgment on callous, unrepentant
sinners. Jesus rather seeks to demonstrate the need for repentance
for all people, something those who perished seemingly had no
opportunity to do before their deaths. Jesus does not cast judgment
on those who died nor does he suggest that these tragedies were of
God&rsquo;s design. Rather, he impresses upon his hearers the urgency
of the need to repent now while they have time. <BR><BR>The final
parable in this gospel text is one Jesus tells to illustrate that the
repentant life bears as much fruit as a tree that has been treated
with fertilizer. The fig tree, barren for three years is granted yet
another year to produce fruit&mdash;with the help of some manure. The
gardener has shown the tree grace in letting it live for yet another
year, a grace that all of us rely on as sinners. But the time is
short. Fruit is expected within another year or the tree will be cut
down. The message is clear: &ldquo;repent or perish.&rdquo;  </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The Tough Question</H4>
<P><I>Why do people suffer in this life?</I></P>
<P>The problem of suffering is more than existential. It tests the
very core of faith. Why does God allow so much suffering in the
world? A loving, merciful God should not rule such a cold, ruthless
world. &quot;Something is wrong,&quot; critics of religion tell us.
&quot;Either God is not loving and merciful. Or, he does not have the
power to control what he created.&quot;</P>
<P>Of course, we Christians have an answer. But it does not satisfy
the critics. Simply, the answer demands change of the listener. God
allows suffering to give we sinners time to reflect and change. Jesus
gave this answer to those who presumed a different reason.</P>
<P>Jesus challenged his audience with some regional news and a
parable. In his speech, he called upon his contemporaries to change.</P>
<P>13:1 &quot;About the same time&quot; is literally &quot;in the
same moment&quot; The word for moment, &quot;kairos,&quot; usually
means &quot;at the right moment,&quot; and has theological overtones
of God's judgement or metanoia. In this case, however, the word has a
general sense of time.</P>
<P>&quot;whose blood Pilate mixed with (the blood of) their
sacrifices&quot; This is a Hebraism. On pilgrimage, Jews would come
to Jerusalem in order to offer sacrifice at the Temple. Many times
they brought their own animals for sacrifice. When Pilate &quot;mixed
human blood with the blood of animal sacrifice,&quot; he had Jewish
Galileans murdered or executed. Where they revolutionaries on their
way to Jerusalem to cause a riot? Or, was this just a phrase to
describe fellow Jews? The context does not tell us how literally or
figuratively to take this saying. We do know Pilate moved against
some from Galilee for an unknown crime or threat.</P>
<P>13:4 Siloam is neighborhood in Old Jerusalem, to the south of the
Temple in the Lower City.</P>
<P>The regional news referred to a series of executions and an
accident. The Galileans were executed most likely for revolutionary
activities. The ruthless Pilate made sure they made good on their
sacrifices [1-2]. Eighteen citizens of Jerusalem suffered from a
building collapse [4].</P>
<P>At the time of Jesus, Jews believed that their fate was God's
punishment for their sins; conversely, good Jews would escape such
punishment. When those in the audience related news about his fellow
countrymen, they assumed Jesus would agree that the fate of the
Galileans matched their crimes. Through Pilate, God judged their
actions swift and sure. But, Jesus compared the execution of the
criminal with the tragedy of the innocent. So, Jesus preached
otherwise. The bad were evil by choice. But, are the good were evil
by presumption? Didn't the guilty and the innocent suffer the same
fate?</P>
<P>Ultimately, Jesus implied, people cannot read the mind of God and
understand his sense of justice. Nor should they try. Both the good
and the evil suffer. God was God. And, his ways were mysterious.</P>
<P>People cannot understand why suffering exists, why divine
providence works the way it does. But that does not mean they lack a
means of action. The only option people have to face God's judgement
was repentance: placing one's focus upon and trust in God.</P>
<P>13:9 &quot; And, if it indeed bears fruit in the future...&quot;
This sentence, while incomplete, assumes a positive response. (See
the popular translation above for an example)</P>
<P>The parable of the fig tree counterbalanced gloomy news with the
hope that time had not completely run out. There was still time to
change and that change should produce fruit. But the change would be
painful and require help. The time to begin was now!</P>
<P>Not only was delayed judgment a glimmer of hope, the story implied
the mediation of a helper. The gardener or vine dresser pleaded for a
delay. So, Christians have always believed, Jesus interceded for the
world with his Father. This was also part of the answer to the
critic. Justice delayed allowed time for the sinner to repent and
revealed the merciful mediation of God's only Son.</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: Suffering and the Test of Faith (CCC 163-165)</P>
<P>Faith gives us the first taste of the afterlife. In faith, we have
a vision of life with God. An existence in pure justice and, at the
same time, pure mercy. We will know ourselves as we truly are, but
through the divine eyes of Love.</P>
<P>This time on earth, however, is a time of test. Not just against
evil. But for faith. The problem of suffering presents us with such a
test. Suffering is more than an intellectual puzzle to be solved. It
challenges us to act. Either we reach out in the belief that God will
help us on the path. Or, we fade into in cynicism.</P>
<P>Others have walked the path of test before us. Abraham, Mary, and
Jesus himself. If we only look to their example, we can find
inspiration and real help. Yes, suffering may shake us. But others
have suffered and remained faithful. So can we.</P>
<P><I>What story of suffering and faith has inspired you? Why has it
inspired you?</I></P>
<P>When we suffer, when others suffer, the choice of faith arises.
Jesus used two reports of death to show the choice given. We might
not know why suffering exists. But we can use suffering as a bridge
to change. A chance to get closer to God.</P>
<P>As the parable of the fig tree implies, we not only have a choice.
We have a helper. Someone to care for us during our struggles and our
suffering. Someone greater than we, who came to serve us.</P>
<P>How do we answer the critic in the problem of suffering? With the
choice of faith and the face of Christ. God does not abolish
suffering to keep us at a distance. No, he allows suffering to bring
us closer. And so his Son may be revealed to all.</P>
<P>So, the next time ths problem of suffering raises its head, let us
look the cross. The sign of faith. And the sign of the Savior.</P>
<P><I>What pain do you suffer from? Place that hurt in God's hands
just for a few moments this day. And see what happens. </I>
