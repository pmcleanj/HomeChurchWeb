Statement: "Let it alone for one more year..." Questions: Repentance,
and mercy. Mercy, and repentance. In the season of Lent, we are
especially mindful of the call to repentance. Are there specific acts,
prayers, or signs that show that we have turned away from evil and
turned toward God in a heartfelt effort to allow our lives to be
changed by God&#8217;s grace at work in us? How is repentance expressed in
our worship life as a congregation? Perhaps a single act or prayer
falls short, and we need to &#8220;practice&#8221; repentance as a daily statement
of faith and trust in God&#8217;s mercy. Is it enough to say that we repent?
Are there behaviors that need to be changed? Do we find unwelcome
behaviors and attitudes thriving within us that have persisted because
of our unwillingness to practice restraint and self-discipline, as Paul
describes in the reading from Corinthians? How is this Lent of 2004 an
opportunity to change that? Do we feel strong enough to meet the test,
and how might we be upheld by our faith that &#8220;God will not let [us] be
tested beyond [our] strength&#8221;? Our behaviors have shaped our
relationships and our institutions. Reflect on the very difficult call
to change not only our personal behaviors and attitudes but all to
which those behaviors and attitudes have given shape. What might that
cost us? Whose life might be transformed, besides our own? How have we
slipped into thinking that our church, or our community, is somehow
immune to the judgment of God? How have we fallen into a kind of false
confidence that has forgotten our human need to repent and return to
God, while judging others for falling short? The parable of the fig
tree is urgent and clear in its message of both repentance and mercy.
Mercy may temper the call to repentance, but it does not eliminate it.
&#8220;If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, cut it down.&#8221;
Has our faith in God&#8217;s grace let us at times to mute the call to
repentance? Finally, in re-reading the Isaiah text after the others,
might we reflect on all that we have allowed to be our treasure, that
to which we have given our hearts, that which we have purchased with
our lives and to which we have given our very selves, that which was
not bread, which was not water, the very stuff of life&#8230; can we feel
that it is not too late to change, to turn again toward that which
truly satisfies? How does the life of the community of faith help us to
find our way to such a new beginning?

I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our
ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and
all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate
the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For
they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was
Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they
were struck down in the wilderness.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not
desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did;
as it is written, &#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose
up to play.&#8221; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them
did, and twenty three thousand fell in a single day. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were
destroyed by serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and
were destroyed by the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve
as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the
ends of the ages have come. So if you think you are standing, watch out
that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common
to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond
your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so
that you may be able to endure it.

asked them, &#8220;Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this

for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why
should it be wasting the soil?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sir, let it alone for one

Almost every church, synagogue, and mosque knows about mission on their
doorstep. They all receive requests for help from individuals in their
neighborhoods. The congregations of the East Hillside neighborhood, a
lower-income section of Duluth, Minnesota, see more than their share of
people in need. &#8220;They come asking for food, money for gasoline or
utilities, and help with housing,&#8221; says Rev. Kathy Nelson, pastor of
Peace United Church of Christ. Busy clergy cannot always provide the
help and guidance, or avoid the duplication, which are required in such
situations. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
To coordinate their response to these requests, Peace UCC joined with
six other congregations--Lutheran, African Methodist Episcopal, Roman
Catholic, and Jewish--to establish the Gabriel Project. Together they
hired a part-time social worker, a member of Peace UCC. Now applicants
are screened by a professional, who can either refer the applicant to
existing community resources or provide financial assistance as a last
resort. In a three-month period, over 250 individuals are served in
this way.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
The Gabriel Project also tries to deal with the systemic causes of the
specific requests for help they receive from individuals. Duluth was
once known for its reasonable rental property. But now a shortage of
decent affordable housing lies behind many of the problems the Gabriel
Project encounters every day. Sometimes the congregations use their
influence to expose and publicize landlord neglect of existing
buildings. But they have also formed YIMBY, which stands for &#8220;Yes in My
Backyard,&#8221; to encourage the development of new housing opportunities.
Through community organizing and lobbying of the city council, for
example, they press for innovations such as the conversion of an unused
public school into low-income housing. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
Among other things, the Gabriel Project frees clergy to plan positive
responses to the needs of the community. One of those responses is
known as KISS, which stands for Kids in Need of School Supplies.
Responding to the slogan, HUGS or Help Us Give Supplies, individuals
and congregations pitch in, along with local stores and a radio
station, to buy the backpacks and school supplies to put in them. Then,
late in August of each year, KISS distributes backpacks to over a
thousand lower-income primary school students at the Back-to-School
Bonanza. On the day they come to receive their backpacks, the children
and their parents also have an opportunity to sign up for school lunch
programs and Head Start. In addition, over seventy volunteers from
Gabriel Project congregations participate in the reading program at
Grant School. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
Four times in holy scripture, the angel Gabriel delivers a momentous
message. Every day, the Gabriel Project brings a message of hope to
someone in its Duluth neighborhood.

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a
Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and
liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister
to read all of the lessons.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the
lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or
recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is
appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way.
The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with
refrains and music.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">During
Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first
option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture;
the second is thematically related to the other readings.</font></font></p><p>
