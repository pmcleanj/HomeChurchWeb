1996-2003 Chris Haslam:</H4>
<P>The people of Israel have received the Ten Commandments verbally,
but Moses is still up on Mount Sinai receiving them in writing. To
the people, he is &ldquo;delayed&rdquo; (or <EM>shamefully late</EM>,
per another translation.) They ask Aaron to &ldquo;make gods&rdquo;,
thus breaking the first (and second) Commandments. Why is &ldquo;gods&rdquo;
plural? Either Aaron compromises by only making one calf, or (more
likely) the story as handed down orally mentioned only one. Then,
when it was written down, the plural was used. But why? After
Solomon&rsquo;s death (in 930 BC), Israel split into two kingdoms. To
avoid people visiting Jerusalem (which was in the south), the king of
the northern kingdom, Jeroboam, had <U>two</U> golden calves made,
and had one set up at each of two alternative places of worship (see
1 Kings <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Kings+12%3A28-30">12:28-30</A>).
The writer had two objectives (which to us conflict here): 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>In our reading, the people willfully rebel against God.
	(Modern Jewish translations consider <EM>Elohim</EM>, <EM>god</EM>
	or &ldquo;gods&rdquo;, to be singular, thus implying that Judaism
	has always been monotheistic.)</P>
</UL>
<P>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A7">7</A>,
by telling Moses that Israel is &ldquo;your&rdquo; people, God
threatens Israel. He says that they have &ldquo;acted perversely&rdquo;
or <EM>succumbed to moral decay</EM>. (The word translated &ldquo;revel&rdquo;
in v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A6">6</A>
has connotations of immorality.) God threatens his &ldquo;wrath&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A10">10</A>);
he even offers to make Moses the founder of a <U>new</U> &ldquo;great
nation&rdquo;. But Moses does not give in to this temptation; rather
he stands by Israel. He pleads with God: you have looked after us so
far, so why quit now? Won&rsquo;t the Egyptians be able to claim that
you are evil: that you led the people of Israel out into the desert
in order to kill them? (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A12">12</A>)
Please God, don&rsquo;t go back on your promises to the patriarchs!</P>
<P>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A14">14</A>,
God does <EM>change</EM> &ldquo;his mind&rdquo; or <EM>lets himself
be sorry</EM>, but in vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A15-35">15-35</A>
Moses gets angry with the people, smashes the law tablets, burns and
grinds up the calf, and makes the people drink water polluted with
the resulting gold powder. Aaron offers a weak excuse for his actions
(the people made me do it; the fire formed the gold into a calf) and
the Levites, as ordered by God through Moses, put some of the people
to death, as punishment. Moses wins pardon for the people, but God
punishes all with a plague.</P>

<P>This psalm begins as a summons to praise God for his goodness and
compassion (&ldquo;steadfast love&rdquo;). How can humans adequately
praise the &ldquo;mighty doings&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A2">2</A>)
of God? Only the person who is just and righteous can do this (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A3">3</A>).
May God, when he restores &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A5">5</A>)
to Israel, include me in his act of deliverance. I will then share in
rejoicing in his deeds of help to his &ldquo;chosen ones&rdquo;
(Israel) in the past. The people have sinned as their ancestors did
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A6">6</A>).
Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A7-47">7-47</A>
recall the ways in which the people of Israel failed to live up to
their pact with God during the Exodus. V. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A19">19</A>
tells the sorry tale of making of the &ldquo;calf&rdquo; image at
&ldquo;Horeb&rdquo;, i.e. Mount Sinai. They worshipped this image,
one of &ldquo;an ox that eats grass&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A20">20</A>),
i.e. a bull. (The &ldquo;land of Ham&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A22">22</A>,
is Egypt.) Moses succeeded in convincing God not to be angry, to
refrain from destroying them. The psalm ends (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+106%3A48">48</A>)
by praising God, Israel&rsquo;s god through all ages.</P>

<P>Paul began the conclusion to the letter back in <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+3%3A1">3:1a</A>.
After a digression &ndash; to warn against heresy and self-indulgence
and to urge devotion to Christ &ndash; he tries to finish the letter,
but certain concerns intrude. It seems that &ldquo;Euodia&rdquo; (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A2">2</A>)
and &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo;, two workers for Christ at Philippi,
differ in their understanding of what the way of Christ is, and that
this is causing disunity in the community. We do not know to whom
Paul refers as his &ldquo;loyal companion&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A3">3</A>);
he is asked to be instrumental in achieving reconciliation. We read
of &ldquo;Clement&rdquo; nowhere else. The idea that God keeps of
&ldquo;book of life&rdquo;, a roll of the faithful to be opened at
the end of time, is also found in Exodus <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Exodus+32%3A32">32:32</A>
and Psalm <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+69%3A28">69:28</A>;
in Luke <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Luke+10%3A20">10:20</A>,
Jesus bids his disciples to &ldquo;rejoice that ... [their] names are
written in heaven&rdquo;. V. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A4">4</A>
is the conventional Greek salutation (like our <EM>goodbye</EM>) but
here Paul means &ldquo;rejoice&rdquo; literally. He expects the
Second Coming soon: &ldquo;The Lord is near&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A5">5</A>).
Then v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A6">6</A>:
rather than worrying on their own, the Philippians should ask God to
help them, through prayer, both of &ldquo;supplication&rdquo;
(petition) and &ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo;. God&rsquo;s peace will
protect them against their own failings and external threats. The
virtues Paul exhorts his followers to pursue in v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Philippians+4%3A8">8</A>
are those for which any Greek was expected to strive: he urges moral
uprightness to all who follow Christ.</P>

<P>What are the challenges your church faces, and the questions that
arise about God&rsquo;s call and direction in the life you share as a
community of faith? What are the &ldquo;true,&rdquo; &ldquo;honorable,&rdquo;
&ldquo;just,&rdquo; &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; &ldquo;pleasing,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;commendable&rdquo; things that you think about, together? What
are the &ldquo;guides&rdquo; for your congregation that give you
direction and vision?&nbsp;How often do you think long-term and
big-picture about these values? Do the everyday,&nbsp;month-to-month,
and year-to-year activities and programs sometimes lose this
focus?&nbsp;What are moments when you could feel &ldquo;the God of
peace&rdquo; in your midst, in both recent history and in the shared
story of your congregation? How can you tap into that source of peace
as a means of hearing God&rsquo;s voice, still speaking to your
church today, through these words of Paul addressed to a small,
struggling, counter-cultural church long ago?</P>

<P>This is the third parable about the kingdom of heaven. Jesus&rsquo;
audience would naturally associate a festive meal with the
celebration of God&rsquo;s people at the end of time. This story has
elements of harshness and tragedy; some responses seem
disproportionate to the <EM>crime</EM>. It was the custom for the
host to <EM>send</EM> &ldquo;his slaves&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A3">3</A>)
to invite the guests, and again to tell them when dinner was ready;
preparing a banquet took many hours. To refuse to come, to refuse a
king&rsquo;s command, is treason; to kill his slaves (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A6">6</A>)
amounts to insurrection, so the king sends troops to put down the
rebellion. After those whom the king had chosen refuse to come, he
invites all people, &ldquo;both good and bad&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+22%3A10">10</A>).
(In Jesus&rsquo; day tax collectors were considered &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.)
One guest is ill-prepared for the banquet (v.11); the king banishes
him to torment.</P>
<P>We recognize the king as God. The first guests are those who are
hostile to Jesus; the one without the wedding robe represents those
who do not count the cost in becoming disciples. The judgement on
anyone who does not prepare will be at least as severe as that on
those who reject Christ. The final verse is the moral of the story &ndash;
a generalization of Jesus&rsquo; intent in telling the parable.</P>
