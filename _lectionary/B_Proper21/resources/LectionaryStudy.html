1:1, 2:1-10</A> </STRONG><BR><FONT SIZE=2>Regarding the Book of Job,
Chris Haslam at <A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?</A>
writes: &ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2>The book of Job is about suffering: it
seeks to answer the question: why does God allow the faithful to
suffer? The first two chapters, which are in prose, tell of a
legendary figure of Judaism called Job. In this story (which may be
extremely ancient), a very righteous man is tested: is he as godly as
he seems, or is his godliness only an appearance, a result of his
acquisition of wealth and his position as father of a dynasty? His
continuing fidelity through deprivation of all that he possesses
demonstrates that he is truly godly. (In the final act of the drama,
God restores his greatness.) Most of the book is poetry, and appears
to have been written later. It is largely concerned with the meaning
of divine justice and suffering. Through dialogues with Job's
so-called &quot;friends&quot;, we see Job learn that wisdom is
God-given. Humans cannot find the way to it; God gives it to those
who worship him.</FONT> &rdquo;</FONT> 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Earlier books speak of humans
deviating from God&rsquo;s ways, being punished for their sins, and
being restored to God&rsquo;s favour. But in the wisdom books,
another side of God&rsquo;s relationship with people is explored: he
has other purposes in his relations with humans. Today&rsquo;s
reading sets the scene for Job&rsquo;s story, in which the older way
of knowing God is contrasted with the newer. &ldquo;Job&rdquo; is a
foreigner; he lives in &ldquo;Uz&rdquo;, south-east of Palestine. As
such, he is drawn to God by faith, not ethnic origin. He is
&ldquo;blameless&rdquo; (perfect in integrity, consistent in
character) and &ldquo;upright&rdquo; (living according to a moral
norm). He has a right relationship with God; he shows him reverence
and obedience. He deliberately and consistently chooses to do good.
But worthy as he is, Satan suggests to God that his faith be tested
(1:6-11): are material success and children, rewards for fidelity,
his bonds to God, or is it faith (&ldquo;out of nothing&rdquo;, i.e.
in love)? God agrees that Job shall be tested (1:12). (&ldquo;Satan&rdquo;
here is <U>not</U> the devil; rather he spies on people&rsquo;s
misdeeds and reports them to God.) So Job loses his children and all
his wealth (1:13-19), grieves (1:20), and accepts his lot before God
(1:21). &ldquo;In all this Job did not sin or charge God with
wrong-doing&rdquo; (1:22). Job passes the first test; he continues to
bless God as the origin of all life: it is God&rsquo;s to give and
God&rsquo;s to take away.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now Job is tested again. 2:1 pictures God as
a potentate with a court of &ldquo;heavenly beings&rdquo; round him.
God suggests that Job be tested further (2:3). 2:4 says: people may
be prepared to give up wealth to save their </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">hides</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
(&ldquo;skin for skin&rdquo; is from bartering hides) but (2:5) if
God ruins their health then they will turn away from him. Job moves
to the garbage (rubbish) dump (&ldquo;potsherd&rdquo;, &ldquo;ashes&rdquo;,
2:8); he excludes himself from human society. His wife reacts as
Satan expects Job to do, advising him to end his misery and pain
(2:9) but Job is reasonable, kindly and wise in his answer (2:10):
both he and his wife (&ldquo;we&rdquo;) have suffered, but even so we
are not in a position to tell God which of his gifts we will receive.
He sees his suffering as from God, but still maintains his faith in
him.</FONT></P>

<A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?</A>
writes: &ldquo;Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were
written over many centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's
temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are
of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal
psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;
there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the
end of each book.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The psalmist seeks delivery from
antagonists. He has lived with &ldquo;integrity&rdquo;, in a godly
way; he has trusted in God constantly. Either he has been unjustly
accused, or he simply invites God to test his commitment. In vv. 4-5,
he protests his innocence with a <EM>negative confession</EM>: he has
always avoided those who say they are God&rsquo;s but are not, and
those opposed to God. He is even willing to proclaim his innocence
publicly in the liturgy (&ldquo;around your altar&rdquo;, v. 6).
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;glory abides&rdquo; (v. 8) in the Temple. He prays
for help, for deliverance from his ungodly enemies; may his destiny
not be the suffering of those who go against God (v. 9). Finally, he
vows to continue to &ldquo;walk in my integrity&rdquo; (v. 11), in
God&rsquo;s ways. He really is godly, and will honour God in public
worship. </FONT>

8</A></STRONG><BR><FONT COLOR="#800000">This reading focuses upon the
place of marriage in the plan of creation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Genesis 2:18-24 represents the height of the
second creation story in Genesis. The first creation story (Genesis
1) begins with water and the furthest reaches of the (then known)
universe. Over the course of seven days, creation becomes closer and
closer until it touches the person in the creation of man and woman.
(One can think of this story as &quot;creation by the sea.&quot;)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">In the second creation story (Genesis), a
desert appears. God orders a spring to appear and, from the mud of
the sand and the water, he creates the first human being. But, God
realizes the loneliness of the first person [18], so he creates
animals and plant life [19]. In giving the animals and plant life
names, the first person defines their power in purpose in creation
[19-20]. In this sense, the first person was God's &quot;co-creator.&quot;
But even this activity does satisfy the first person's loneliness
[20].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Up to this point, the first person did not
have a sexual function; the word &quot;man&quot; is used in a generic
sense for &quot;human being.&quot; Only with the deep sleep and the
removal of the rib [21] did the first person become male. God creates
the woman and presents her to the man [22]; the man repeats the
&quot;creation naming&quot; [19-20] by giving his partner a name (and
a function) [23]. This is the high point of the second creation story
God creates while man &quot;co-creates.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The editorial comment about marriage [24]
only defines the previous passage. The fullness of humanity is
expressed in the marriage bond. Marriage is the exercise of
co-creation with God. A good marriage brings happiness and joy to the
couple; loneliness is banished.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Marriage has taken a beating in our culture,
but it will never completely disappear. The second creation story
speaks a universal truth; marriage is the world-wide symbol of human
fulfillment.</FONT></P>

writes: &ldquo;Apart from the concluding verses (which may have been
added later), this book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a
letter. Its name comes from its approach to Christianity: it is
couched is Judaic terms. The identity of the author is unknown;
Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only God knows&quot; who wrote
Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, arguing for the
absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as revealer and mediator
of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old Testament, the author
argues for the superiority of Christ to the prophets, angels and
Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his sacrifice is much
more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus is the &quot;heavenly&quot;
High Priest, making the true sacrifice for the sins of the people,
but he is also of the same flesh and blood as those he makes holy.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#800000">In Judaism, angels controlled the world (2:5),
and priests were seen as angels. The quotation in 2:6-8 is Psalm
8:4-6; to the author, who wrote Psalms is immaterial (2:6): the psalm
is the word of God. These verses say humans are superior to nature,
but here they are used to refer to Jesus, possibly because &ldquo;human
beings&rdquo; was translated </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">son of
man</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000"> in the contemporary
translation. All creation is under our control (2:8) but now we only
see this in Jesus: he for a time humbled himself in becoming human,
so that he might die for the sake of all. Jesus&rsquo; exaltation
(&ldquo;crowned&rdquo;, 2:9) is a consequence of his death. Then
2:10: it was in accordance with God&rsquo;s plan to save all people
that Jesus should complete God&rsquo;s action (&ldquo;make ...
perfect&rdquo;); Jesus is the forerunner for all of us in being with
God forever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The letter to the Hebrews was not a &ldquo;church
letter&rdquo; in the normal sense. It was not a letter sent to a
particular church (or group of churches) that addressed particular
needs. Instead, the letter to the Hebrews was a teaching, a sermon or
speech that instructed its audience. The author of Hebrews advanced
the notion that Jesus was the Messiah as the eternal High Priest.
Implicit with the title and subject of the letter was the audience:
Jewish Christians in turmoil over the destruction of the Temple in 70
AD. With the loss of the their spiritual focal point, Jews inside and
outside Christianity must have asasked the same questions: How do we
worship God (and keep the Law about worship)? What is the future of
God&rsquo;s people?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The author offered some unique answers. One
of those answers lie in &ldquo;salvation history.&rdquo; This concept
was uniquely Jewish, for it saw cosmic history as chronological time
with a beginning and an end (not as a series of endless cycles of
nature). It also saw God as the author of time (in the beginning,
everything came from God and, in the end, everything would return to
God). Finally, it saw God active within time and history. The
faceless God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was the &ldquo;living &ldquo;God,
a God to be personally experienced not made an object in stone as an
idol.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The author of Hebrews placed Jesus into the
center of salvation history. He was the instrument and reason for the
cosmos [2:10]. He came from God yet humbled himself to be born as one
of us and to die as we all will [2:9]. Yet, his death would be
salvific. Through his suffering and death, he would destroy death and
offer everyone a relationship with God [2:9-10]. And, through the
same means, he would raise the status of all he saved, for he would
call them &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo; [2:11]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The author of Hebrews presented us with the
&ldquo;Big Picture.&rdquo; Jesus came from God at the beginning of
time and in the Incarnation. And would return to God through his
Resurrection-Ascension and at the end of time when he would destroy
all evil and return creation back to his Father. Jesus was the sign
that God was at work in the world in a definitive way. As another
human being, Jesus gave us a tactile way to experience God. Yet, he
transcends our world to become the Savior of all.</FONT></P>

writes: &ldquo;As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death
became old and died, the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition
has it that Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered.
This book stresses the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to
understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels were
written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Jesus is now in Judea (or east of
the Jordan, in Perea.) Mosaic law permitted a man to divorce his wife
(but not a woman her husband) for cause, but the grounds were
unclear. The Pharisees were divided re the legality of divorce as
well as the grounds for it, so their question is a trap. Deuteronomy
24:1-4 says (in part) that a man may simply &ldquo;write a
certificate of dismissal&rdquo; (v. 4), without legal proceedings.
(That book was seen as Moses&rsquo; teaching.) In vv. 5-8, Jesus
says: Moses allowed divorce as a concession to human weakness, but
God&rsquo;s original plan was that marriage be for life: man and wife
are &ldquo;one flesh&rdquo;; my stance is God&rsquo;s plan, not
Mosaic law. In this plan, remarriage is either literally &ldquo;adultery&rdquo;
(vv. 11-12) or a deviation from God&rsquo;s ways. (Sometimes a wife,
in effect, divorced her husband. Elsewhere Jesus accepts that a man
may divorce an unfaithful wife.)</FONT></P>
