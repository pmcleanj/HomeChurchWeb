<b>Micah</b>
</small><p>
<small>Micah was the last of the eighth-century prophets. He was from south-western 
Judah, west of Hebron. He is preoccupied with social justice and is totally 
independent of political and religious leaders. Times are bad: Assyria has 
captured Damascus and Samaria. Jerusalem was besieged in 701 BC. But 
danger was internal too: leaders accepted bribes; merchants cheated their 
customers; pagan gods were worshipped along with the Lord. Micah 
preaches about sin and punishment; people have rejected God. The coming 
punishment is due to their sin. Even so, there is hope for the future: a 
remnant will form the nucleus of a new Israel, and its leader will be a true 
shepherd, one who brings peace.

<strong>Micah 6:1-8</strong>
<p>Micah was roughly contemporary with Isaiah. He was a fearless
champion of the oppressed and under-privileged, who attacked the
socio-economic injustice of his day: wealthy capitalists oppressed
peasant landowners. The scene for today's reading is a lawcourt (&#8220;plead
your case&#8221;). Israel is on trial for contravening the Sinai covenant;
the witnesses are the whole cosmos: the &#8220;mountains ... hills&#8221; and
&#8220;foundations of the earth&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). (The earth was thought to stand 
on pillars.) God has a <em>bone to pick</em>
(&#8220;controversy&#8221;, lawsuit) with Israel (&#8220;his people&#8221;) for forgetting that
he has saved her in the past and for not walking in his ways. He speaks
in vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A3-5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3-5</a>: what more could I have done? I 
cared for you and protected you. I delivered you from slavery in &#8220;Egypt&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>); I gave you great leaders. Recall 
how when, during the Exodus, after you defeated the Amorites, I stymied Balak&#8217;s (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
devious scheme: he hired the prophet &#8220;Balaam&#8221; to curse you, but he
blessed Israel! I gave you safe passage across the Jordan. (&#8220;Shittim&#8221;
was Israel's last camping place before crossing and &#8220;Gilgal&#8221; the first
on the west bank of the river.) I saved then, and I will do so again.</p>
<p>In v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>,
Israel, the defendant, pleads her case: God, what can we do to make
amends for our infidelity? Will you be pleased with sacrifices,
especially &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221; (which were total, because nothing was
left for consumption by the priests) of &#8220;calves&#8221; (which were especially
valuable)? Would repeated offerings of rams and of oil (used in the
liturgy for lamps, sacred anointings and purification) satisfy you?
Should we sacrifice our eldest sons (as Canaanites do)? Perhaps Micah
speaks in v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+6%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>:
no, God requires internal conversion and a proper spiritual attitude.
He has told you what he expects: to be godly, (&#8220;to do justice ... to
love kindness&#8221;), to hold him in proper respect and to walk in his ways.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 15</strong>
<p>This psalm was likely used in a liturgy of admission to the Temple.

worship in the Temple (&#8220;your tent&#8221;)? Who is acceptable to you?

<b>1 Corinthians</b> 
</small><p>
<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<strong>1 Corinthians 1:18-31</strong>
<p>The &#8220;message&#8221; of Christ crucified, risen and alive is God&#8217;s power to
us, but to those who hear the good news and reject &#8220;the cross&#8221; it is
nonsense. This, Paul says, God prophesied through Isaiah (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>). He has decried divisions 
in the church at Corinth; he now recognizes two groups of humans: the &#8220;wise&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>) and &#8220;those who 
believe&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>). Are, 
he asks rhetorically, the Jewish &#8220;scribe&#8221; (v.

and the rationalist (&#8220;debater&#8221;) &#8211; both possessors of worldly wisdom &#8211;
truly wise? Through the birth of Christ, God has shown worldly wisdom
to be folly, for (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>) one can&#8217;t 
&#8220;know God through wisdom&#8221;, i.e. in a philosophical way. <em>Knowing God</em>
is experiential. In fact, God chose to save believers through the
apparent folly of what Paul preaches (&#8220;our proclamation&#8221;). To &#8220;demand
signs&#8221; (miracles, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a>)
is to refuse to trust in God; &#8220;Jews&#8221; refused Christ due to their
particular expectations in a messiah. To &#8220;desire wisdom&#8221; is to
construct a religion whose demands one is prepared to accept. (The
&#8220;Greeks&#8221; in v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">22</a> are unbelieving 
<em>non-Jews</em>.) God&#8217;s ways are not human ways (v.

<p>Consider yourselves, Christians at Corinth (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26</a>): few of you are what 
<em>the world</em> would have chosen: few are not <em>worldly wise</em>, &#8220;powerful&#8221; or aristocratic. But God&#8217;s way is to choose those of apparently little account (&#8220;foolish&#8221;, &#8220;weak&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>) to show the apparently 
important that they are wrong, to &#8220;shame&#8221; them. This is God&#8217;s paradoxical way (v.

boasting. Christ&#8217;s living in human form started a new way of being human (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">30</a>):
we are set apart for his purposes (&#8220;sanctification&#8221;) and no longer
controlled by evil (&#8220;redemption&#8221;) so that we become one with God
(&#8220;righteousness&#8221;) &#8211; so that we can (as God commanded through Jeremiah)
&#8220;boast in the Lord&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>). Christ

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

<strong>Matthew 5:1-12</strong>
<p>Jesus ascends a mountain in Galilee where he speaks to his
&#8220;disciples&#8221;, his followers, in the Sermon on the Mount &#8211; but the
&#8220;crowds&#8221; hear too: see <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+7%3A28" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:28</a>, the end of the Sermon. He

Beatitudes, from the Latin for <em>blessed</em>.
To be &#8220;blessed&#8221; is to be happy. All the qualities are expected of the
faithful, for the consequence is the same: they will enjoy God&#8217;s
end-time rule. In fact, the Kingdom has already begun, but it not yet
completed. They will attain (and are attaining) eternal life.</p>
<p>The &#8220;poor in spirit&#8221; (v.

personal advantage, will share in God&#8217;s rule. Those who &#8220;hunger&#8221; (v.

those spreading the good news, striving to reconcile the world to God,
will be persecuted because of the message they carry (as were the Old
Testament &#8220;prophets&#8221;). They too should &#8220;rejoice and be glad&#8221; for God
will reward them. Jesus tells his audience that the values for
admission to the Kingdom are the reverse of those valued by
materialists.</p>
