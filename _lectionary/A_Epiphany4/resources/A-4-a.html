<h4>The Beatitudes</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Which best describes your idea of happiness: self-fulfillment, contentment, or a lack of want? Explain your answer.</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Everyone strives to be "happy," but everyone has a
different idea of what the word means. Many pursue money, power, and
position, as a means to happiness. Others see physical exercise as the
key to a pleasant life. Still others seek more spiritual goals in
prayer and meditation as the blessed road.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In each case, the pursuit of happiness has a cost.
What will people sacrifice for happiness? For Matthew, happiness meant
"being blessed." The cost was reputation and the danger for
persecution. The reward was the Kingdom.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>1 When Jesus saw all the people, he went up a hill and sat down. His followers drew near. 2 And Jesus taught them:</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">3 God blesses those with humble hearts. He rules over them now and forever!</font></b></p>

a huge gift in heaven!</font></b></p>
<p class="bodytext">In his record of the Beatitudes, Matthew stressed
the spiritual life had the cost of slander and persecution. Yet, God
would reward the faithful with his reign.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>1 Seeing the crowds, HE went up onto the
mountain. When HE sat down, his disciples came to HIM (for
instruction). 2 Opening HIS mouth, HE taught them, saying:</b></p>

against you on my account. 12a Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is
great in heaven.</font></b></p>
<p class="indent">5:1-2 Matthew portrayed a teaching moment. In ancient
schooling, a teacher would sit on a chair while his students sat on the
ground. The raised level of the teacher was a sign of status and
respect. Teachers in the synagogues sat on the "chair of Moses,"
indicating the teacher spoke in the tradition of the Law-giver.</p>
<p class="indent">The image Matthew used recalled a revelation from
God. Jesus, like God at Mt. Sinai and other scenes, spoke from the
mountain top. The people gathered below to hear God's word. Jesus sat
and his disciples gathered around him, with the intention of receiving
instruction.</p>
<p class="indent">5:3 "poor in spirit..." The term "poor" could be
equated with "the common people." In the time of Jesus ninety percent
of the population were poor. With poverty so prevalent, the poor could
not stand out as a special, closed group. After the Babylonian exile,
the "poor" even referred to those in the Diaspora. Hence, the term
"poor" had a general meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">Matthew differentiated this beatitude from Luke's
with the addition of "in spirit." Scholars dispute whether the addition
changed the meaning of the "poor." In context, Matthew seemed to say
everyone ("the poor") belonged to the Kingdom, even the rich who acted
justly with the common people ("in spirit"). Did everyone want to enter
the Kingdom? That was the question of faith.</p>
<p class="indent">5:3, 5 These beatitudes echo Isaiah 61:1-2:</p>
<p class="indent"><i>The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the
Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has
sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to
proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of vengeance of our
God; to comfort all who mourn. (RSV)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The parallels between theses two beatitudes is
obvious. The poor are victims that God will care for in his reign. All
mourners will be comforted. What is in heaven (5:3), should be on earth
(5:5). Many scholars believe verse 5 should follow verse 3 to make the
parallel clear.</p>
<p class="indent">5:6 "righteousness" is the equivalent to God's will
and human cooperation with his will. It can be loosely translated "to
do God's will."</p>
<p class="indent">5:8 The word "clean" means "kosher." Psalm 24:3-4
emphasized the importance of clean ("kosher") hands and heart to
worship the Lord in the Temple:</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who
shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
who does not lift up his soul to what is false, and does not swear
deceitfully. (RSV)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In the light of the Psalm, this beatitude referred to the attitude and result of sincere worship.</p>
<p class="indent">5:9 With the Jewish-Christian undertones of Matthew,
peace was the equivalent to "Shalom," the sense that all was right
between God and humanity, all was right within the human community.
But, there was a problem. Only God could give true peace, just as only
God could call humans his "children." Matthew seemed to imply the
"peacemakers" are those who participate in God's Shalom.</p>
<p class="indent">5:11 "revile" meant slander as well as direct verbal
abuse. Later Jewish rabbis considered these insults (both direct and
indirect) more evil than idolatry, sexual infidelity, and bloodshed
combined! Such comments robbed one of reputation and even of livelihood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">All nine of Matthew's beatitudes stressed the
coming of God's kingdom. Matthew wrote eight of his beatitudes in the
third person ("they" as opposed to "you" or "us"). And he directed the
results of the beatitude to the future:</p>
<p class="indent">The Kingdom (5:3,10)</p>
<p class="indent">A time of comforting (5:4)</p>
<p class="indent">Inheriting the (Promised) land (5:5)</p>
<p class="indent">A time to receive righteousness and mercy (5:6,7)</p>
<p class="indent">A vision of God (5:8)</p>
<p class="indent">A relationship to God as his child (5:9)</p>
<p class="bodytext">The final beatitude bridged the activities of the
previous eight (awareness of spiritual need, meekness, striving for
justice, etc.) with their results in the Kingdom. [5:11-12] Here,
Matthew wrote directly to the disciples: "Blessed are you (second
person, plural) when you are persecuted; your reward will be in
heaven." So, with a spiritual disposition or activity that leads to a
promised reward, Matthew urged his readers to delay self-fulfillment,
contentment, need fulfillment, or public recognition for something
greater. According to Matthew, the followers of Jesus should be willing
to suffer in order to see the Kingdom and the joy it brings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Matthew presented these beatitudes as the height of
Jesus' teaching. Just like God took Moses up Mt. Sinai and gave him the
Law, Jesus took his disciples up to the mountain and taught them.
[5:1-2] The mountain represented a place of intimacy with God; the
Teacher represented God's word and wisdom. In Matthew's gospel, the
setting was an opportunity for intense reflection and insight.</p>

<p class="bodytext">In Luke, the poor and the mourners were the results
the economic conditions Jesus and his followers lived in; those
striving for righteousness ("right living") followed personal and
social activities; those living openly as Christians, a new sect,
invited criticism and prejudice from an uninformed populace. For Luke,
the beatitudes were directed at the victims of social conditions found
in the Roman Empire. The "blessed" were those who could live out the
Serenity Prayer: "God grant me the spirit to accept the things I cannot
change, the power to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know
the difference." The reward for living out the prayer was the Kingdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Matthew refocused these four beatitudes away from
social condition and placed it upon spiritual disposition. The poor
became the "poor in spirit," those who know they depend on God for all
things [5:3]. The mourners who suffered from economic or social strife
became those who mourn from spiritual poverty in culture [5:4].
Striving for righteousness became more of a personal struggle than
activities for social change. [5:6] Only the last beatitude remained
the same; those who lived as Christians would be persecuted. [5:11-12]</p>
<p class="bodytext">The other beatitudes reflected Matthew's insights
on blessedness as a spiritual pursuit. The meek, not the proud or
arrogant, would receive the earth (i.e., the Promised Land); in this
case, the earth was the arena of the Kingdom [5:5]. In the end, the
merciful would receive in like measure [5:7]. Those whose sole focus
was upon God (the "pure of heart") would see the Master [5:8]. Those
who worked for harmony in the community and in the world would be
recognized as God's children [5:9]. Those who lived a life based upon
commitment instead of convenience, those who were willing to stand up
to criticism for a principle, would be saved [5:10]; this passage is
reinforced the ninth beatitude on persecution.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Matthew wrote for a Jewish-Christian audience. The
followers in Matthew's community lived by edicts, rules, and guidelines
of the Jewish Law. Matthew highlighted the beatitudes of Jesus as the
way to live a highly structured life. The beatitudes pointed to
awareness of spiritual need, humility, peaceful living, moral living,
and compassion as the keys to happiness. But most of all, Matthew's
beatitudes saw Christian witness as the center piece to a happy life.
In our busy, high-stressed lifestyles, Matthew's beatitudes can be our
means to a happy, blessed life.</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: The Beatitudes (CCC 1716-1724)</p>
<p class="indent">The Beatitudes lie at the heart of Christ's teaching,
for they describe our relationship to the Kingdom in three ways. First,
these simple rules address our highest desire: happiness with God. For,
only God can satisfy the heart. Second, they describe the path to God
for us as individuals and together as a Church. Through the Beatitudes,
we share God's very life (sanctifying grace) because we enter into his
Kingdom. Finally, they challenge us to live moral lives by putting God
first. If we want to know what it truly means to be a Christian, read
the Beatitudes in Matthew.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Who is one Christian you know that is truly happy? Why are he or she happy?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">While there are many ideals for happiness, we
Christians find ours in the Beatitudes. Guides to a Christians life.
Ideals with the goal of the Kingdom. We might not be able to fully live
the Beatitudes today. But that is not the point. Like any ideal of
happiness, the road is as important as the destination. Striving to
live the Beatitudes day by day opens us to God's lead and the way to
his Kingdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>What can you do today to live out the Beatitudes this day?</i></p>
