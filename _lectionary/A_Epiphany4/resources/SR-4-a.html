<h4>Our Place Before God</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>What advantages have your received in life?</i></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>26 Look at where you are in life, brothers and
sisters. Most of you were not born into educated families, wealthy
families, or families of powerful people. 27 Instead, God chose people
the world thinks are foolish so he could put people who think they are
wise to shame. He chose people who have no power to shame the powerful.
28 He even chose the hated and truly unimportant people, those who have
no standing in society, so he could destroy all social standing. 29
This way nobody can brag about themselves to God! 31 Instead God put
you with Christ Jesus, who is our wisdom from God. Jesus shows us the
right way to God. He makes us holy. And he saved us when he died on the
cross. Jesus did this to show the Bible saying is true: &#8220;If someone
should brag, let that person brag about the Lord!&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>26 For, look to your calling (in life),
brothers, that many (of you were) not wise according to the flesh, nor
(were) many in power, nor (were) many well-born. 27 But, God chose the
foolish of the world, so that he might shame the wise, and God chose
the weak of the world, so that he might shame the strong, 28 and God
chose the (ones) of no (important) family and the (ones) having been
despised, the (ones) without (social) standing, so that he might
abolish (such) standing, 29 so that all flesh might not brag before
God. 30 But from him, you are in CHRIST JESUS who became our wisdom
from God, righteousness, holiness, and redemption, so that, just as it
has been written, &#8220;The bragging (one), let him brag in the LORD.&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="indent">1:26 &#8220;that many (of you were) not wise according to
the flesh, nor (were) many in power, nor (were) many well-born&#8221; Paul
simply pointed out the station most of the believers in Corinth were
born to. &#8220;...according to the flesh&#8221; meant &#8220;by birth.&#8221; So the phrase
could be translated: &#8220;many of you were born either into educated
families, nor families of power, not families of wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">1:28 &#8220; the (ones) of no (important) family&#8221; is
literally &#8220;the unborn.&#8221; In this case, Paul was not speaking of those
still in the womb, but those without a family pedigree. Even the poor
bragged about their family linage. Those without such a family tree
were considered to be without identity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;the (ones) without (social) standing&#8221; is literally &#8220;the (ones) without being.&#8221; Paul spoke as a social critic in this context.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Congratulations! If you are reading this, you
belong to the privileged of the world. You are literate and you have
access to a computer hooked up to the internet. Statistically, you,
like me, are educated, well-off, and have some measure of power
(compared to the rest of the world). Yet, what does this education,
wealth, and power ultimately give us? Bragging rights?</p>
<p class="bodytext">From one of more self-evident passages in
Scripture, Paul reminded his audience (and us) that social place in the
world was meaningless compared to standing before God. The community in
Corinth had divided itself into cliques, based upon &#8220;doctrine&#8221; and
presumed &#8220;wisdom.&#8221; These cliques filled themselves with
self-importance. But, where did these groups stand in the eyes of God?
Weren&#8217;t the rarified opinions they held of themselves unimportant?
Furthermore, don&#8217;t the weak and powerless, ignorant and the foolish
show off the glory of God to a greater extent than the educated movers
and shakers of the world?</p>
<p class="bodytext">If we have any advantage in this world, it is based
on grace, not on self-improvement or inherence. Grace gives us faith,
hope, and love, not a street corner pulpit to promote our
self-righteous self-importance. Grace gives us the virtue of awe, the
sure knowledge of our place as creature before our God. Grace helps us
see others as ourselves, saved sinners.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How have you used your advantages for the good of others? How has your serive humbled you?</i></p>
