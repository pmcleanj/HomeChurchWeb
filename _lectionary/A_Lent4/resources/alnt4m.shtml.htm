<b>1 Samuel</b>
</small><p>
<small>At one time, the first and second books of Samuel formed a single 
book. They were separated in the Greek translation of the Hebrew 
Scriptures known as the Septuagint (about 250 BC). 1 Samuel begins 
with the story of Samuel: hence the name. 1 Samuel is the first of 
four books which tell the story of Israel's monarchy. Samuel anointed
the first king. We then read about King Saul, and later about David's 
rise to prominence.

</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>1 Samuel 16:1-13</strong>
<p>After his anointing by Samuel, David is mentioned as a lyre-player
at the court of King Saul, ruler of an area north and east of Jerusalem
(then called Jebus). David left his court to become a warlord to the
south, in the Bethlehem area. Saul has enjoyed God&#8217;s favour, but has
lost it by disobeying the prophet Samuel&#8217;s instructions. God now orders
Samuel, his agent, to anoint a new king, a son of &#8220;Jesse&#8221;. Samuel&#8217;s
route to Bethlehem is through Saul&#8217;s territory, so he asks God how he
is to make the trip (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). God tells him to say that he 
comes to &#8220;sacrifice to the Lord&#8221;: this is part of his purpose. &#8220;Eliab&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) is Jesse&#8217;s eldest son. 
Surely a tall first-born is God&#8217;s choice for king (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A6-7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6-7</a>). But God&#8217;s choice is 
not humankind&#8217;s choice. (Jesse&#8217;s second and third sons are &#8220;Abinadab&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>, and &#8220;Shammah&#8221;, v.

&#8220;ruddy&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>); he 
is God&#8217;s choice. When Samuel anoints him (with olive oil), the &#8220;spirit of the Lord&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Samuel+16%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13</a>)
comes upon him. His brothers are witnesses. Samuel returns to &#8220;Ramah&#8221;,
his seat of judgement. Saul persecutes David relentlessly but upon
Saul&#8217;s death in battle, David unifies the north and the south and
ascends to the throne.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 23</strong>
<p>In the ancient Near East, the king was seen as shepherd (vv.

his sheep, and constantly cares for, his sheep. He revives our very lives (&#8220;soul&#8221;, v.

(&#8220;right paths&#8221;). Even when beset by evil (&#8220;darkest valley&#8221;, v.

God&#8217;s &#8220;rod&#8221; (a defence against wolves and lions) protects us; his &#8220;staff&#8221; (v.

is even more impressive, for it is in the presence of his foes. Kings
were plenteously anointed with oil (a symbol of power and dedication to
a holy purpose.) May God&#8217;s &#8220;goodness and mercy&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+23%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>, steadfast love) follow (or

<b>Ephesians</b>
</small><p>
<small>This letter of Paul was written from prison, probably in Rome. Whilst 
the Bible states that it was written to the church at Ephesus, the some 
early manuscripts do not contain an addressee in 1:1. This would imply 
that Ephesians was a circular letter, sent to a number of churches. If 
so, it introduced a new idea into letter writing: we know of no other 
circular letters from this period. This book celebrates the life of the 
church, a unique community established by God through the work of Jesus 
Christ, who is its head, and also the head of the whole creation.

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 9:1-41</strong>
<p>Perhaps Jesus encounters the blind man in the precincts of the
Temple, where beggars habitually gathered. Illness and physical
disability were attributed to sin: in this case, either of the man
(prenatally) or of &#8220;his parents&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>).
Jesus dismisses the link between sin and illness, at least in this
case; rather he says that this man&#8217;s impairment provides opportunity to
do the works of God. Jesus and his followers (&#8220;we&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) must do his mission while they can. 
A time is coming (from his crucifixion to his resurrection) when he, &#8220;the light of the world&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>) will not be in the world, so he 
will be unable to &#8220;work&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>, and the disciples will desert him). 
Jesus takes earth (the substance from which <em>human</em>, Adam, was made), makes a &#8220;mud&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) poultice, and applies it to the 
man&#8217;s eyes. If he has trust enough to go to the &#8220;pool&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) and wash it off, he will have 
sight. He does; thus Jesus completes one of &#8220;God&#8217;s works&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>). John draws attention to 
&#8220;Siloam&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>) as meaning 
&#8220;Sent&#8221;, thereby alluding to Jesus as <em>sent</em> for the salvation of humankind &#8211; so washing symbolizes baptism.</p>
<p>Despite the man&#8217;s claim to be the one who was a beggar, those who know him are divided: some say &#8220;it is he&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) but others doubt: he only looks 
like the beggar. In vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A10-22" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10-22</a>, the 
man confirms his cure as genuine. The Pharisees consider making mud on the sabbath as breaking the Law (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>) so they examine the man. They too 
are divided (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>):
between those who say Jesus can&#8217;t be from God (for he breaks the Law)
and those who wonder how a sabbath-breaker can perform miracles (which
only one approved by God can do). So they question the man further,
hoping that the dilemma can be resolved by discrediting the cure (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>). They 
ask: <em>What do you say about his opening of your eyes?</em>
He insists that Jesus&#8217; power is from God (&#8220;a prophet&#8221;). The man&#8217;s
parents swear that their son was blind from birth but say no more, for
fear of being cast out of the community (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A18-23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18-23</a>). The 
Pharisees invite the man to confess that he has deceived them in claiming to be cured (v.

is an Old Testament formula inviting confession.) The man boldly asserts the fact of the cure and adds, ironically: <em>if you listen to my story you may admit that Jesus is right!</em> (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>) They question Jesus&#8217; 
authority: &#8220;we know&#8221; (v.

Jesus is an upstart! The man ridicules their <em>expert</em> opinion (v.

are penitent (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>). Jesus must be 
&#8220;from God&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A33" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">33</a>) for no

Pharisees a lesson, the man is evicted from the synagogue (&#8220;drove him out&#8221;, v.

faith shown by his conduct (vv.

for two purposes: to give understanding, sight, of ultimate reality, and to punish those who think they &#8220;see&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>) but don&#8217;t. The Pharisees

but you make the unfounded assumption that you do &#8220;see&#8221;, so you are liable to be punished.</p>
