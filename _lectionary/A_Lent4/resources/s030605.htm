<br>
Seeing and knowing, trusting and believing. And, in the end, following where God 
leads. A &#8220;little&#8221; story in 1 Samuel begins the very &#8220;big&#8221; story of David, the 
great king and shepherd, but just as importantly, it tells us about seeing &#8211; and 
trusting &#8211; as God sees, not as we, and the world, see. God and Samuel are &#8220;de-briefing&#8221; 
about the failure of Saul to be what he should have been, and God gives Samuel 
something of a pep talk or, better, his marching orders. Samuel could sit around 
and complain and grieve about Saul, or he could show faith in what he knows &#8211; 
God&#8217;s goodness and wisdom &#8211; and strike out into the unknown &#8211; toward Jesse and 
a whole slew of sons, each one more impressive than the last, toward a new ruler, 
a new chosen one, new hope for the people. He could fill up his horn and strike 
out into a new and glorious future, trusting that God will take him where he needs 
to go, to the one he needs to anoint. <br>
<br>
&#8220;The Lord does not see as mortals see&#8230;&#8221; The outward appearances of the first seven 
sons do no matter, yet David himself is described as &#8220;handsome, ruddy, with beautiful 
eyes.&#8221; The future king and the glory of Israel&#8217;s political life are introduced 
to us as a shepherd still tending his sheep. (Is it any wonder that Psalm 23 is 
also a lectionary text for this day?) Away from the center of activity and the 
momentous things happening with this important visitor, David is still the one 
who emerges &#8220;out of nowhere&#8221; to lead and to embody so much possibility for his 
people. <br>
<br>
In John&#8217;s story of the healing of the man born blind, there is more talk of seeing 
and, underneath, more teaching about believing and coming to see more than outward 
appearances and realities. The man whose sight is given to him by Jesus stumbles 
toward belief and understanding, and his openness and intensity of experience 
contrast sharply with the fearful questions of his neighbors (how cynical not 
to rejoice!) and the downright judgmental reaction of the religious establishment. 
Cure on the Sabbath, break religious rules &#8211; how can such a person be of God? 
And yet &#8220;the man born blind&#8221; sees so much better than those who supposedly study 
&#8211; and speak of &#8211; God all the time. While the others in the story remain in the 
same place they were at its beginning, the healed man finds his life transformed: 
he is in a new and very different place. <br>
<br>
John wrote for the struggling early Christian community that knew what it felt 
like to be &#8220;driven out,&#8221; and they knew what it felt like to be in between a powerful 
experience of conversion and the understanding and trust that can eventually follow, 
when one understands what the conversion and healing are all about. Sometimes 
this involves judgment, rejection, condemnation, and alienation. It is a lonely 
place to be, and John&#8217;s way of telling this story must have spoken powerfully 
to the people in that situation. <br>
<br>
What are the hidden truths and realities, perhaps just under the surface, that 
you need to see, in your individual life and in the life your congregation? What 
does your church need to see in order to move more purposefully toward a new future, 
new hope, new possibilities? How is the <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i> directing 
you to keep looking, deeper and deeper, into the realities of your shared life, 
to find previously unseen possibilities there? Are there unrecognized leaders 
and spiritual guides within the life of your church who are busy, on the edges, 
with tending the sheep while the &#8220;important&#8221; matters are discussed by others? 
What are the standards we use to judge what we see, whether it&#8217;s a person, a building, 
a mission or ministry, or whether it&#8217;s an event or experience, such as a healing 
or transformation, or even a disaster? We might reflect on the core truths we 
depend on, just as the man cured of physical blindness did when he reasoned that 
Jesus must be &#8220;of God,&#8221; since he was able to make him see. And yet even that reasoning 
was not enough. He needed to encounter Jesus, to hear and understand what was 
happening. When &#8211; and how &#8211; does your church take time to encounter Jesus Christ 
and to hear the truth that transforms your life, to follow in a new path that 
you previously could not even see? <br>
<br>
Does it ever happen in the life of your congregation that there are some who question 
even the most wonderful turn of events &#8211; the miracles &#8211; and press for more information, 
details, rather than praise God and give thanks? Is it easier to say that something 
is &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; rather than to follow a new path? Is it tempting to claim 
our identity based on what has gone before and on our ancestry, rather than on 
who the <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i> calls us to be, to become, today and 
in the days ahead? How much does fear influence our inquiries, our wondering, 
our discernment? How do you sense a <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i>, calming 
your fear and calling you to a new boldness and a new faith?

the LORD said, &#8220;Take a heifer with you, and say, &#8216;I have come to sacrifice to

said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. 
And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; Jesse made seven of his sons

these.&#8221; Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all your sons here?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;There remains 
yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.&#8221; And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send 
and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.&#8221; He sent and brought 
him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, 
&#8220;Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.&#8221; Then Samuel took the horn of oil, 
and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the LORD came 
mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.

&#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221; Jesus answered, 
&#8220;Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God&#8217;s works 
might be revealed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is 
day; night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am 
the light of the world.&#8221; When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made 
mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man&#8217;s eyes, saying to him, &#8220;Go, 
wash in the pool of Siloam&#8221; (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came 
back able to see. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar 
began to ask, &#8220;Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?&#8221; Some were saying, 
&#8220;It is he.&#8221; Others were saying, &#8220;No, but it is someone like him.&#8221; He kept saying, 
&#8220;I am the man.&#8221; But they kept asking him, &#8220;Then how were your eyes opened?&#8221; He 
answered, &#8220;The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, 
&#8216;Go to Siloam and wash.&#8217; Then I went and washed and received my sight.&#8221; They said 
to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it 
was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. Then the Pharisees 
also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, &#8220;He put 
mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.&#8221; Some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This 
man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.&#8221; But others said, &#8220;How 
can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?&#8221; And they were divided. So they 
said again to the blind man, &#8220;What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.&#8221; 
He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight 
until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked 
them, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221; 
His parents answered, &#8220;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. 
Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#8221; His parents said this because 
they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who 
confessed Jesus to be the Messiah£ would be put out of the synagogue. Therefore 
his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221; 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said 
to him, &#8220;Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I 
do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, 
now I see.&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#8221; 
He answered them, &#8220;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you 
want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#8221; Then they reviled 
him, saying, &#8220;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that 
God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#8221; 
The man answered, &#8220;Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes 
from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, 
but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will. Never since the 
world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. 
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#8221; They answered him, &#8220;You were 
born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?&#8221; And they drove him out. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, 
&#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;And who is he, sir? Tell me, 
so that I may believe in him.&#8221; Jesus said to him, &#8220;You have seen him, and the 
one speaking with you is he.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Lord, I believe.&#8221; And he worshiped him. 
Jesus said, &#8220;I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see 
may see, and those who do see may become blind.&#8221; Some of the Pharisees near him 
heard this and said to him, &#8220;Surely we are not blind, are we?&#8221; Jesus said to them, 
&#8220;If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your 
sin remains.

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Last October, a small group of very happy people assembled at the Denver airport 
to joyfully welcome a Somali Bantu refugee family of eight. Seven adults and eleven 
children from Berkeley (CA) Community United Church of Christ held aloft a huge 
sign, made by the Sunday School class and written in the Swahili language, with 
the names of each of eight members of the family of Fatuma Abdalla Ali. The welcoming 
party had balloons and stuffed animals large and small. Fatuma&#8217;s mother and father, 
who had been resettled in the U.S. earlier, waited with them. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">When the family finally arrived, with children ranging in age from 8 months 
to 11 years, the children from Berkeley Community UCC gave the stuffed animals 
to the refugee children. Fatuma&#8217;s mother helped one of her grandchildren who didn&#8217;t 
quite know what to do with his stuffed animal: she took it from him and cuddled 
it. The child took it back, cuddled it and a great smile broke over his face. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Rachelle Huschka is one of the most active members in assisting the refugee 
family. She coordinates the church volunteers who visit the refugees, taking them 
clothing and supplies. Rachelle accompanied the family to apply for Social Security 
numbers, a visit which lasted over four hours. As four of the children were being 
enrolled in school, the father asked his children to write down the English alphabet 
as he had taught them. Rachelle was amazed. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Rachelle is thrilled with how receptive the refugee family has been. She said, 
&#8220;I have been a mother, and for 10 years managed a day care, but this is as rewarding 
as a newborn baby.&#8221; Rachelle remarked that God sends you people you can help. 
God doesn&#8217;t just wait until you feel established.

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->
</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one 
psalm at each Sunday service, in this order: 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative 
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
