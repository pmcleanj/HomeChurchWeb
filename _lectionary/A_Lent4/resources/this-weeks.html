      <h2>The Opening of Eyes</h2>A
few weeks ago I attended a Gonzaga Men&#8217;s Basketball Game.&nbsp;
Although all of the seats in the arena are pretty good, the particular
seats that my husband and I were sitting in were close to the
top.&nbsp; As we sat there, they announced that it was time for &#8220;fan of
the game&#8221;.&nbsp; Because I did not really know the number of my seat
nor did I expect to win, I paid no attention to the announcement
blaring over the loudspeaker.&nbsp; It was only when my husband nudged
me and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s your seat.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve won,&#8221; that I realized I
was &#8220;Les Schwab Fan of the Game!&#8221;&nbsp; If he hadn&#8217;t said anything, or
if there was a way for someone else to have taken our seats DOWN IN THE
VERY FRONT ROW, I would have lost without even knowing what I had
gained.&nbsp; I was chosen and yet I was blind until my eyes were
opened!<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
      </h4>The epic
story of King David begins with these verses that we have today.&nbsp;
God tells the prophet Samuel that Saul is out, a new king is in.&nbsp;
A king born in Bethlehem.&nbsp; God provides the action to this
story.&nbsp; While Samuel is the reluctant messenger (he&#8217;s afraid he
might be killed by King Saul&#8217;s people) he does not think up his own
actions.&nbsp; Everything from the denouncing of King Saul to his trip
to Bethlehem to the stretching of the truth that he tells all come from
God.<br>
      <br>
After Samuel has gathered with Jesse and his sons, Samuel begins to
take back the reins.&nbsp; Jesse&#8217;s first son, Eliab, apparently looked
&#8220;kingly.&#8221;&nbsp; Because of this, Samuel is ready to anoint him as
king.&nbsp; But God rejects him.&nbsp; &#8220;Do not look on his appearance
or on the height of his stature.&#8221;&nbsp; The next son is also
rejected.&nbsp; And the next.&nbsp; And the next.&nbsp; All of the
first seven sons of Jesse are &#8220;passed over.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
And then they wait for that last son.&nbsp; They wait.&nbsp; And they
wait.&nbsp; As Samuel says to Jesse, &#8220;We will not sit down until he
comes here.&#8221;&nbsp; And finally &#8220;the one&#8221; comes.&nbsp; Interestingly,
the first thing that is described is David&#8217;s appearance (after we heard
that God only looks in the heart and not the physical
attributes).&nbsp; Apparently he is handsome, movie star
gorgeous.&nbsp; The writer cannot help but comment on his beauty.<br>
      <br>
Again in this story, the action does not come from the people.&nbsp;
David does not initiate a thing.&nbsp; From how the story reads, we
know nothing about David except that he is attractive.&nbsp; When he
shows up, passively he is anointed by Samuel.&nbsp; There is no word
from David.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t even question his destiny.&nbsp; God has
chosen him.&nbsp; He will be king.<br>
<br>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel<br>
</h4>Keeping in mind that the gospel of John always has multi-layers of
meaning, two of the major thrusts for John are the themes of light and
darkness and seeing and not seeing.&nbsp; Both of these themes are in
today&#8217;s gospel reading.<br>
      <br>
There are many stories of people begging Jesus to heal them.&nbsp; This
is not one of those stories.&nbsp; The blind man apparently is just
there.&nbsp; Jesus pulls him into his life in order to make a point
with his disciples.&nbsp; When Jesus is asked, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this
man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221; Jesus uses the blind man
as a life-size example.<br>
      <br>
Again, as in the David story, this blind man is passive.&nbsp; The
action is done to him, not by him.&nbsp; Jesus spits and makes mud,
spreading the mud on this man&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; (Interestingly, the Greek
word &#8220;epichriein&#8221; is used here &#8211; meaning &#8220;anointed&#8221; &#8211; as in Samuel
anointing David for kingship.)&nbsp; The blind man is commanded to go
to a pool and wash and when he does this, his eyes are opened.<br>
      <br>
This man, chosen by Jesus, now sees.&nbsp; He not only sees trees and
birds and flowers, people and objects, but he sees much more than that
as well.&nbsp; At the end of the story, the now-seeing man declares his
faith, &#8220;Lord, I believe.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, the Pharisees are still blinded.&nbsp; Throughout Jesus&#8217;
story in John, the people continue to be divided amongst the chosen and
the not chosen, the seeing and the blind, the children of light and the
children of darkness.<br>
      <br>
This blind man now can see because he is has been chosen as a child of the light.<br>
<br>

      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>Paul&#8217;s
letter declares that those who follow Christ are the people of the
light.&nbsp; He says that if you have been chosen, if you have had your
eyes opened, then no longer sit in the darkness.&nbsp; The light has
come &#8211; now live in the light.<br>
      <br>
It is true that even after one is chosen, it is easy to slip back into
the ways of darkness.&nbsp; The pull of the darkness is sometimes too
hard to resist.&nbsp; Looking at the Old Testament reading, the
anointed King David slipped a time or two into that power of
darkness.&nbsp; For him, repentance came, but so did heartache and
misery.&nbsp; He was a child of the light and yet he &#8220;took part in the
unfruitful works of darkness.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Instead of this, Paul urges those in the light to stay in the
light.&nbsp; In 5:1 Paul states, &#8220;Be imitators of God, therefore, as
dearly loved children.&#8221;&nbsp; First, we are to remember that we are
&#8220;dearly loved children.&#8221;&nbsp; We are not outsiders, we are not blind,
we are not in the blackness of the night &#8211; no!&nbsp; We are &#8220;dearly
loved children!&#8221;&nbsp; And so, in response to this gift of light, we
are to &#8220;imitate&#8221; God.&nbsp; In other words, we are called to be as
Jesus was.&nbsp; We are called to love as Jesus loved, live as Jesus
lived &#8211; for the &#8220;fruit of the light is found in all that is good and
right and true.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
What a great gift to be chosen.&nbsp; Let us live in this light!<br>

<h6 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion<br>
</h6><ol><li>In
the Lutheran Church many churches now include in the Rite of Baptism a
time when oil is placed upon the baptized person&#8217;s forehead.&nbsp; It
is reminiscent of Samuel anointing David when he became king.&nbsp; How
is baptism like David&#8217;s anointing?&nbsp; How is it not?</li><li>It
is widely known that even though David was chosen for greatness, he did
not always act in a great way.&nbsp; How do you feel about his behavior
and the forgiveness he received?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this comforting for us
and our relationship with God?&nbsp; Or is this aggravating?&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
        <li>In
many Bible studies I have had, people become concerned with those who
are not chosen.&nbsp; Is this a concern of yours?&nbsp; How is this
addressed in these scriptures today?&nbsp; In other scriptures
throughout the Bible?</li>
        <li>Jesus&#8217;
healing stories always bring up questions about those not healed.&nbsp;
What about the hundreds of blind men in Palestine who did not receive
their sight from Jesus?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this have bearing to you in
this story?&nbsp; In your life?</li>
        <li>How are we given the gift of sight like the blind man?&nbsp; How are we like the Pharisees?</li>
        <li>In
Ephesians, Paul urges us to be &#8220;imitators of God.&#8221;&nbsp; What does this
mean?&nbsp; How is this a response to God and not a call to &#8220;work for
salvation?&#8221;</li>
