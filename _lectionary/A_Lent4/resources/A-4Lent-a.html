<h4>The Gift of True Sight</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Have you ever played a game with a blindfold?
Or, have you ever been on a trust walk, where you are blindfolded and
led by another person?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Playing games with a blindfold helps us appreciate
the gift of sight. Sight is a double blessing in a culture whose media
manipulates visual contents, its patterns, and its timing. A quickly
edited, fast moving commercial on television proves the point; your
eyes quickly "read" the message.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Through the cure of a person born blind, John's
gospel presents sight in a metaphorical sense. Sometimes a person can
look, but not see. Here, the blind man received not only the ability to
use his eyes but the gift to see the truth.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>1 As Jesus walked by, he saw a beggar who was
born blind. 6 Jesus spat on the ground, mixed the spit and dirt
together to make mud, and rubbed the mud into the man's eyes. 7 <font color="#ee0000">"Go wash your eyes in Siloam Pool,"</font> Jesus told him. The man left and washed the mud off. Now he could see!</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>8 Many people used to walk by the man as he
begged. These people and the man's neighbors wondered, "Isn't this the
man who used to sit and beg?"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>9 At this, there was an argument. "Yes, he's the man," some said. But others disagreed: "He just looks like the man."</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Finally, the man answered, "I'm the beggar!"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>13 Then, they brought the beggar to religious
leaders called Pharisees. 14-16 When the leaders found out Jesus made
mud and healed the man on the Sabbath, they questioned him. "How did
you get your sight back?" the Pharisees demanded.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>"This man came by and put mud on my eyes. I washed it off," the beggar replied. "Now I can see."</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>"Well, God commanded us not to do any work on
the Sabbath. This man broke God's Law when he cured you," some of the
Pharisees stated. "So, this man cannot come from God!" But, other
leaders disagreed. "But how can a man who breaks God's Law do such
things?" they said. So, an argument broke out among the Pharisees. 17
In the end, they asked the beggar, "What's your opinion of the man who
healed you?"</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>"He's a prophet!" the man replied.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>34 At this, the Pharisees got angry. "You've
been evil ever since you were born! How dare you try to tell us what to
think!" they shouted at the man. Then, they threw him out.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>35 Jesus heard what happened to the beggar. When Jesus found the man, he asked him, <font color="#ee0000">"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>36 "Point him out, so I can believe in him," the beggar responded.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>37<font color="#ee0000"> "You've already seen him," </font>Jesus said.<font color="#ee0000"> "That person is talking to you right now."</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>38 "I trust you, Lord!" the man said. Then, he bowed and worshiped Jesus.</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">In John's Gospel, Jesus cured a blind man. In the
ensuing controversy, the man defended Jesus but lost his place in the
community. In the end, however, he found a new place before the Lord.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>1 Passing by, HE saw a man blind from birth.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>6 ...HE spat on the ground, made mud out of the
spit (and dirt), and placed his mud on the (blind man's) eyes. 7 (HE)
said to him, <font color="#ee0000">"Go wash in the Pool of Siloam,"</font>
which translated "Being Sent." Then, (the blind man) went, washed, and
came to see. 8 So, (his) neighbors and those (used to) seeing him (in
his previous state), that he was a beggar, said, "Is this (man) not the
(one) sitting and begging?" 9 Some said, "This is (the man)" Others
said, "No. But he is like (the blind beggar)." That (man) said, "I am
(he)."</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>13 They lead him, the (man) once blind, to the
Pharisees. 14 Now, (it) was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the
mud and opened his eyes. 15 Then, (once) again, the Pharisees asked him
how he saw. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed (the mud
off), and I saw." 16 So, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not
from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath." [But] others said,
"How is a sinful man able to do such signs?" There was a dispute among
them. 17 So, they said to the blind man again, "What do you say about
HIM because he opened your eyes?" He said, "HE is a prophet."</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>34 They answered and said to him, "You were born
completely in sin and you teach us?" They threw him outside (the
community). 35 JESUS heard that they threw him outside and finding him,
said, <font color="#ee0000">"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</font> 36 That (man) answered and said, "Who is he, Sir, that I might believe in him?" 37 JESUS said to him, <font color="#ee0000">"You have seen him. And the (one) speaking with you is that (man)."</font> 38 He said, "I believe, Lord!" And he worshiped HIM.</b></p>
<p class="indent">9:6 The missing phrase is literally "having said
these (things)." The phrase referred what Jesus said before the cure
(in 9:2-5).</p>
<p class="indent">9:7 "came to see" is literally "came to seeing."</p>
<p class="indent">9:8 "(in his previous state)" is literally a noun
that is the object of "seeing." The noun acts as an adverb meaning
"previously."</p>
<p class="indent">9:9 "(the blind beggar)" is the pronoun "him." The reference to the blind man was added for clarification.</p>
<p class="indent">9:15 "(once) again" This was second time the man
answered the question "What happened to you?" This was not the second
time the Pharisees posed the question to the blind man.</p>
<p class="indent">9:16 "dispute" is literally "schism."</p>
<p class="indent">9:34 "They threw him outside (the community)" meant excommunication. The blind man stood outside the local Jewish community.</p>
<p class="indent">9:36, 38 In 9:36, "Sir" is literally "Lord." The
title could be polite address or one of faith. In the context of the
dialogue, polite address is assumed in 9:36. Faith context is assumed
in 9:38</p>
<p class="bodytext">After one controversy in the Temple, Jesus walked
the streets of Jerusalem and stumbled upon a man born blind.
Immediately, Jesus cured him with mud and a washing. [9:1,6-7] (The
blind man washed in the Pool of Siloam or the "sent" pool. As part of
an aqueduct system build over the centuries for Jerusalem, this pool
was the "receiving tank" for the water. Hence, its name; the aqueduct
"sent" water to the pool.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">The man returned to his neighborhood when another
controversy erupted. The blind man's neighbors forced him to defend his
cure. [9:8-9] According to 9:8, the man's neighbors saw the man beg on
a daily basis. Most of the neighbors knew the man from birth, since
culture and livelihood pressured people to maintain a residence from
one generation to the next. And, culture in the time of Jesus was open;
everyone made a point to know their neighbor's business. Why, then, did
the blind man need to defend his cure?</p>
<p class="bodytext">In such a stable, static, open society, people used
deception, secrecy, and lying to protect a sense of reputation. Such
devices, however, led to a sense of disbelief. If one boasted to
inflate a reputation, the response might be a cynical challenge. When
the man demonstrated his cure (and his freedom from begging) to his
neighbors, he was met with incredulity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Because of the controversy, the neighbors brought
the cured man before the Pharisees for a judgement. [9:14] They were to
sit in judgement over one question: Was the beggar a fraud? However,
many asked another question: Was the Healer a sinner? By answering this
second question, they could answer the first question.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A group within the Pharisees began their attack
with a point of the Law. [9:16] Since Jesus cured on the Sabbath, this
group charged, he violated the Third Commandment. As a violator, he
sinned. (As a sinner, he stood outside the Jewish community. So, Jesus
and his disciple would have to be excommunicated; see 9:22 not covered
in this study). The cured man could plainly see his reputation hinged
on that of Jesus, so the cured man had no choice but to associate Jesus
with God. Hence, he declared Jesus was a prophet. [9:17]</p>
<p class="bodytext">The hearing continued in 9:18-33. In the end, the
man questioned the sight (i.e., wisdom) of those in judgement (9:30-33
not covered in this study). In other words, he questioned their
authority to judge Jesus. The Pharisees rebuked the man, claiming he
was born in sin, and, so, unfit to question their authority. [9:34]
Whether they referred to the man's own sinfulness or the sinful
condition of the world (what we call "Original Sin") is unclear.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Since you were born in sin..." (that is, born with
a blindness caused by sin). The Pharisees implicitly equated the man's
blindness to his own immorality or that of his parents. (In 9:2-3,
Jesus rejected this notion.) In doing so, they implicitly acknowledged
Jesus' power to cure the blind man and to forgive sin. For, the logic
goes, if one truly cured the illness (blindness), then he must have
eliminated the cause of the illness (sin).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since the Pharisees excommunicated him, the man now
stood alone,. [9:34b] Without membership in the synagogue, he was no
longer a Jew; he would be stunned by his friends and neighbors alike.
For his defense of Jesus, all he had left was Jesus. So Jesus sought
him out and asked him the question of faith: "Do you believe in the Son
of Man (i.e., Messiah)?" The man's answered with a question: "Who is
he, Lord, so I might trust...him." Jesus then seemed to say: "Open your
eyes. The Messiah is talking to you now." With this revelation, the man
professed his trust in Jesus and worshiped him. [9:35-38]</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Themes: The Characteristics of Faith (CCC 153-165)</p>
<p class="indent">When Jesus cured the blind man, he gave him a choice to change, to chance to trust in God. Jesus invited the man to faith.</p>
<p class="indent">Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused
by him. (CCC 153). We cannot obtain faith by our own efforts or merit.
A faith in God comes from God; he initiates the faith relationship and
every step in that relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">But faith always remains a choice we make. When we
choose to trust in God and believe in what he reveals to us, we
exercise our freedom. Our minds and wills freely cooperate with God's
grace. Faith is not and can never be an act coerced by God or others.</p>
<p class="indent">Faith and understanding are compatible because:</p>
<p class="indent">1) Faith is certain. We have complete trust God will help us through times of doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">2) Faith seeks understanding. In faith, we seek
reasonable answers to life's problems and the troubles of the world. We
also seek a deeper awareness of God acting in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">3) Faith and science are compatible. Since science
and revelation have their source in the same God, scientific study
carried out in an ethical manner cannot conflict with faith. Indeed,
study can cause the same awe and humility in the scientist as
reflection on creation causes in the believer.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to have a relationship with God
without faith. In the same vein, we cannot grow closer to God without
perseverance; just as in human relationships, trust can never be lax.
With perseverance, we have hope, for we are supported by others and we
see the goal of faith. We can look to the witness of others for
inspiration in times of trial. And, as we are drawn closer by God, we
can see the goal of faith, to see God "face to face" "as he truly is"
(CCC 163).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Have you seen God change someone for the better? What sort of changes came about? How was faith involved?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">John's gospel presents us with a challenge. Are we
willing to be changed for the sake of faith? Are we willing to see
things as they are, not as we wish them to be?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The man born blind gained true sight, simply
because he was willing to be changed. Like the man born blind, we, too,
must have open eyes and an open heart, a willingness to let God change
us.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How has God changed you in the past? What sort of change is God calling you to now? </i></p>
