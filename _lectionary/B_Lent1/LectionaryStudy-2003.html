the right date. We are at the beginning of Lent, a season of
preparation for Easter. Our memory scripture for this season is
today's Gospel lesson:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened,
and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: and there came a
voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. And immediately the spirit drove him into the
wilderness.<BR>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted
of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
unto him.<BR>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<BR>And saying,
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and
believe the gospel. </I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">The forty days of Lent
remind us of the forty days Jesus spent fasting in the wilderness.
During Lent, it's normal for Christians to also fast and undertake
acts of penance, as our way of faithfully following our Master. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>But all the while we are fasting, we remember that we
are people of a Promise, and that our God keeps god's promises. We
know that Jesus, who fasted and was rejected and killed, also rose
from the dead and lives forever. Let's read about one of God's
promises and the sign God gave us.</P>

is like Home-work, except that it is done in the pews, instead of
being done at home. Because it is focused on the readings (as the
sermon, presumably, also is) it can be done during the sermon to help
the listener concentrate. Or, it can be done while waiting for
everyone else to finish their communion. It isn't done during
prayers, or hymns, or the readings, because</FONT></P>
