<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Genesis 9:8-17

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Sign of God’s Promise

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>"This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."

<P>Questions:
<BR>We are especially prone, in the church, to concentrate on what we are doing or not doing in our relationship with God or, for that matter, what we are doing (or not doing) in the world.  Perhaps one of the tasks of the pastor and preacher is to call us back, to remind us that it’s not all about us, but about God. It’s about what God is doing and has done not only here and now, but in times long ago and in a future we cannot even dimly see. The Noah story of destruction is a difficult one for preachers (not to mention church school teachers, unless they domesticate it with cute pictures of the animals riding in the boat, without mentioning the death and destruction that necessitated the ride).  These early chapters of Genesis have marvelously diverse images of a God who on the one hand tenderly makes clothing for Adam and Eve and takes walks in the garden at evening time, and yet on the other hand orders the destruction of all living things in the wake of sin and wickedness.  But this text is about remembering and reminding, and about relationship.  Even God needs to be reminded, in this case by a beautiful bow (ironically, an ancient weapon) in the sky, of a promise God makes out of tenderness and compassion.  This is not Noah’s idea, the text indicates.  God initiates the whole plan, the promise and the bow and the reassurance it offers.  Yes, Noah has offered a fragrant offering after landing on dry ground, but God is the one who comes up with the idea of a promise, along with a reminder in the rainbow.  Our Lenten readings will say much about the relationship of humans and God.  What does this story tell us about our ancient ancestors and their view of the world?  Their view of God?  The first thought that occurs to God after Noah’s offering is a resolution never again to “curse the ground because of humankind…nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.” Do you believe that God needs to be reminded of that promise, or of any promise?  Readings in future weeks will speak of covenant in terms of Israel, but this covenant, this beautiful moment of reconciliation and peace, is a universal one with all peoples and with nature itself, all living creatures.  The blessing is for all, too, a renewal of the blessing at creation, along with the command to exercise dominion.  At the beginning of our Lenten journey, how does this text speak to us about our relationship with God today?  How does it call us to remember our relationship with the earth and with all living creatures?  The Noah story is one of power and the checking of power.  What power do we have over nature, and how have we used and mis-used that power?  What do we need to remember in order to be in right relationship with God, with the earth, and with all peoples? What vision of reconciliation might we hold out to the world, as people of faith?

<P><B>Genesis 9:8-17</B>

<P>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, "As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth." 

<P>God said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 

<P>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."

<P>Refrain:

Your mercy and love have been from of old.
</B>

<P>To you, O God,
<BR>I lift up my soul.

<P>O my God, in you I trust; do not let

<BR>do not let my enemies exult over

<P>Do not let those who wait for you be
<BR>put to shame;

<P>Make me to know your ways, O God;
<BR>teach me your paths.

<P>Lead me in your truth, and teach me,
<BR>for you are God of my salvation;
<BR>for you I wait all day long.

<P>Be mindful of your mercy, O God,
<BR>and of your steadfast love,
<BR>for they have been from of old.

<P>Do not remember the sins of my

<BR>or my trangressions;

<P>Good and upright is God;

<P><B>1 Peter 3:18-22</B>

<P>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. 

<P>And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.

<!-- BEGIN GOSPEL -->

<<P><B>Mark 1:9-15</B>

<P>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”

<P>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him. Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”

<B><p>THE RAINBOW SIGN OF GOD’S PROMISE</B>

<p>And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.”                                
 																		                   --  Genesis 9:12-13


<p>When Mexican Christians gather to remember God’s promise to Noah and his descendants, they sing:</p>

			<div><font size=2><blockquote>De colores, de colores se visten los campos en la primavera.<br/>
                   De colores, de colores son los pajaritos que vienen de afuera.<br/>
                   De colores, de colores es el arco iris que vemos salir,<br/>
                   Y por eso los grandes amores de muchos colores me gustan a mi,<br/>
                   Y por eso los grandes amores de muchos colores me gustan a mi.</blockquote></font></div>


    <P>In the same spirit, those of us who are not fluent in Spanish, sing:</p>

                  <div><font size=2><blockquote>Sing of colors, sing of colors that over the hills in profusion are springing;<br/>
                  Sing of colors, of the birds that fly outside my window their canticles singing;<br/>
                  Sing of colors, in the rainbow’s bright colors God’s promise of hope we recall;<br/>
                  Sing of colors that make up the earth and give thanks to the God who created us all.<br/>
                  Sing of colors that make up the earth and give thanks to the God who created us all.</blockquote></font></div>

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
