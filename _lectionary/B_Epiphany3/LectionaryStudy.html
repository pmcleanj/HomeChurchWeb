<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:2 &quot;Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim
to it the message that I tell you.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:3 So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the
word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three
days' walk across.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's walk. And
he cried out, &quot;Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown!&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:5 And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a
fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    3:10 When God saw what they did, how they turned from their
evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said
he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.</P>

<P>Jonah</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah is a prophet, but he is unlike any other for whom a book is
named in the Old Testament. Some (e.g. Jeremiah) heard the word
reluctantly but then fully embraced the ministry to which God called
them, but Jonah tries his best (and his worst!) to avoid doing God's
will: he is a caricature of a prophet. The book opens with God's call
to Jonah: &quot;Go at once to Nineveh ... and cry out against it; for
their wickedness has come up before me.&quot; Jonah's reaction is to
try to escape God's presence. When called a second time, he does
travel to the capital of Assyria, and its residents repent of their
waywardness. A message of this book is that God does care about other
peoples, even those who are Israel's enemies.</P>
<P>	Jonah 3:1-5,10</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah is the archetypical reluctant prophet. Earlier, in 1:2, God
has called him to &ldquo;&lsquo;Go at once to Nineveh ... and cry out
against it; for their wickedness has come up before me&rsquo;&rdquo;
but he has tried to escape by sailing to the ends of the earth. God
has punished him by having a large fish swallow him.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now God commands Jonah a second time: God is not going to let him
off! He now obeys: he goes to the capital of Assyria, (this being a
book of exaggerations) &ldquo;an exceedingly large city&rdquo; (3:3).
(Excavations show that it was about 5 x 2&frac12; kilometres.) He
goes into the city, but only part-way (&ldquo;a day&rsquo;s walk&rdquo;,
3:4): half measures are good enough for him. The first readers
probably identified &ldquo;forty&rdquo; with either the Flood or the
Exodus. Nineveh will be &ldquo;overthrown&rdquo; or destroyed. In
3:5, the residents react to this oracle: they believe God (in the
person of his prophet) and acknowledge their godlessness. 3:6-9 (not
part of our reading) tell us the king&rsquo;s reaction and edict: he
dons &ldquo;sackcloth&rdquo; and sits in &ldquo;ashes&rdquo; &ndash;
traditional signs of mourning and repentance; he decrees three stages
of repentance for all:</P>
<P># admission of guilt, by way of outward signs,</P>
<P># change in each person&rsquo;s attitude to others (in turning
away from evil and violence),</P>
<P># acknowledgement of God&rsquo;s freedom in how he responds to
repentance (&ldquo;he may turn from his fierce anger&rdquo;,</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:9) Then 3:10: God does change his mind: he accepts their
repentance and delivers them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Obviously this is a story, but it is one that teaches; it is a
parable. It illuminates an issue of its time, the waywardness of
Israel. God is central and powerful. He can favour whomever he
chooses, even hated enemies of the past.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalms</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written
over many centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple
(about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five
types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms,
and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;
there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the
end of each book.</P>
<P>	Psalm 62:5-12</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This is a psalm of trust. Vv. 5-7 are the psalmist&rsquo;s
example, which (in v. 8) he invites others to emulate. In God he
finds his hope for deliverance, his reference point in life and his
&ldquo;refuge&rdquo; from enemies. Both poverty (&ldquo;low estate&rdquo;,
v. 9) and power (&ldquo;high estate&rdquo;) do not endure.
&ldquo;Extortion&rdquo; (v. 10) and &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; are means
of acquiring rank. Do not depend on wealth; it too is worth little.
The bottom line is in vv. 11b and 12a: the psalmist has heard God say
that power and &ldquo;steadfast love&rdquo; (loyalty to the covenant
) belong to him: he has learnt this well (&ldquo;twice&rdquo;). God
does reward everyone based on his or her actions.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1 Corinthians</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from
the Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and
ship-building centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its
inhabitants came from far and wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two
letters he has received concerning lack of harmony and internal
strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had founded. Paul wrote
this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 AD.</P>
<P>	1 Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the Revised English Bible, v. 29 begins: &ldquo;What I mean ...
is this: the time we live in will not last long. While it lasts,
married men ...&rdquo;. V. 31b fits naturally: &ldquo;For the present
time is passing away.&rdquo; We live in the era between Christ&rsquo;s
first and second coming. This is the era in which God calls his
church to bring as many as possible to believe in him and to follow
his ways. This is an enormous task, and not one to be taken lightly &ndash;
it requires maximum effort from a few. Paul expected the era to end
in his own lifetime, so to him every minute of each day counted in a
big way: time spent on other activities was time lost.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s advice to married men (v. 29b) &ndash; to behave as
though they have no wives &ndash; must be taken in context, so let us
look at the whole chapter. Vv. 32-33 tell us why he wrote vv. 29-31a:
&ldquo;I want you to be free from anxieties ... the married man is
anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife, and
his interests are divided&rdquo;. Paul is saying that, at a very
critical time in history, when all effort is needed to bring people
to the Lord, some need to devote some effort to other matters. We
need to examine v. 29b in the context of this letter:</P>
<P># In this chapter, he identifies what are God&rsquo;s commands,
his commands, and his suggestions; our reading contains suggestions.</P>
<P># In v. 2, Paul recommends that (to avoid sexual deviances) &ldquo;each
man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&rdquo; Each has &ldquo;conjugal rights&rdquo; (v. 3); each has
authority over the body of the other. Then v. 5: &ldquo;Do not
deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to
devote yourselves to prayer ...&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;This I
say by way of concession, not command. I wish that all were as I
myself am [i.e. single]. But each has a particular gift from God ...&rdquo;
(vv. 6-7). Marriage is important.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So what is Paul saying in vv. 29-31? Given the magnitude of our
mission, we need to devote as much effort as possible to God&rsquo;s
work. What we do in the world (e.g. commerce, &ldquo;deal with the
world&rdquo;) is of transitory value. Our focus should be on
preparation for Christ&rsquo;s second coming.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Symbol of St Mark</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and
died, the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that
Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered. This book
stresses the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to understanding
who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels were written, i.e. Matthew
and Luke, they used the Gospel according to Mark as a source. Mark is
most probably the John Mark mentioned in Acts 12:12: his mother's
house was a meeting place for believers.</P>
<P>	Mark 1:14-20</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark has just told us, briefly, about Jesus&rsquo; temptation in
the wilderness. Now he returns to Galilee. His message begins with
&ldquo;the time is fulfilled&rdquo; (v. 15): the time appointed by
God, the decisive time for God&rsquo;s action, has arrived. &ldquo;The
kingdom of God has come near&rdquo;: the final era of history is
imminent. Numerous sayings of Jesus support Paul&rsquo;s view that
the end is near, but Jesus did say that no human knows when he will
come again, and he will not come when expected (13:32-36). He also
said that &ldquo;the kingdom of God is among you&rdquo; (Luke 17:21),
and that the kingdom has begun. Jews believed that when they
individually and collectively admitted the error of their ways and
returned to God&rsquo;s way (&ldquo;repent&rdquo;, v. 15), the
Messiah would come. We too are called to adopt God&rsquo;s way, to
&ldquo;believe in the good news&rdquo;. The whole of Mark is an
expansion of this verse.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In vv. 16-20, the first four disciples are called: they
immediately leave their previous occupations, and follow Jesus. Jesus
expresses his command in their terms (v. 17). (Immediacy of response
is a mark of this gospel.) These disciples owned nets (v. 19) and had
employees (&ldquo;hired men&rdquo;, v. 20), so they were people of
rank. They gave up security and family (&ldquo;left their father&rdquo;,
v. 20) to devote themselves to Christ&rsquo;s mission.</P>

<P>Jonah 3:1-5,10</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Here is the introductory paragraph most of which I clipped out:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    Jonah is a prophet, but he is unlike any other for whom a book
is named in the Old Testament. Some (e.g. Jeremiah) heard the word
reluctantly but then fully embraced the ministry to which God called
them, but Jonah tries his best (and his worst!) to avoid doing God&rsquo;s
will: he is a caricature of a prophet. The book opens with God&rsquo;s
call to Jonah: &ldquo;Go at once to Nineveh ... and cry out against
it; for their wickedness has come up before me.&rdquo; Jonah&rsquo;s
reaction is to try to escape God&rsquo;s presence: he boards a ship
for as far away as possible. But God brings a storm, the sailors toss
Jonah overboard, and a large fish swallows him. Jonah repents of his
waywardness, and the fish &ldquo;spew[s] Jonah out upon the dry
land.&rdquo; (2:10).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1:3: &ldquo;Tarshish&rdquo;: Most scholars think that this was a
city in the western Mediterranean, possibly in Spain; however it may
be Tarsus, where Paul was later born. [Jan Dijkman] Tarsus is in the
north-eastern corner of the Mediterranean. In Genesis 10:4, a brother
of &ldquo;Tarshish&rdquo; is &ldquo;Kittim&rdquo;; Josephus, in
Antiquities of the Jews, identifies &ldquo;Kittim&rdquo; with Kition
or Kitti, a Phoenician city on the island of Cyprus. In the Old
Testament, &ldquo;Kittim&rdquo; appears to have included all the
islands of the Aegean Sea. [HBD] In the genealogical table in Genesis
10, the names of brothers are often names of neighbouring
territories. &ldquo;Ships of Tarshish&rdquo; are mentioned in 1 Kings
10:22; 2 Chronicles 9:21; Isaiah 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezekiel 27:25. If
Tarshish is Tarsus, Jonah wasn&rsquo;t fleeing very far, but 1 Kings
10:22 is particularly interesting: &ldquo;... the fleet of ships of
Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and
peacocks&rdquo;. Perhaps Jonah was planning on boarding a ship of
Tarshish to flee to Africa. Perhaps v. 3 has been abbreviated.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:3: &ldquo;an exceedingly large city&rdquo;: The great city of
Nineveh has been shown by excavations to have been very large. That
the population was more than 120,000 (as stated in 4:11) is fully
credible. [CAB] The author draws on legendary reports of the size of
the city (and its wickedness), which had grown in the popular
imagination since its demise in 612 BC. (Some scholars date this book
to the late fifth century BC although others see it as having been
written anywhere from the sixth century to the early Hellenistic
period.) [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Comments: Excavations show that it was about 5 x 2&frac12;
kilometres i.e. about 3 x 1&frac12; miles.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:4: The lack of enthusiasm on Jonah&rsquo;s part, coupled with
the enormous size of the city and the impressive magnitude of its
violence and cruelty heightens the enormity of the miracle of its
sudden and total conversion. The actual oracle of Jonah which effects
this astounding change consists of only five words in Hebrew. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:4: &ldquo;overthrown&rdquo;: The use of the word hpk, meaning to
destroy, overturn (as in Genesis 19:25) and other parallels (Jonah
1:2 and Genesis 18:21; 19:13) call to mind the story of Sodom and
Gomorrah in Genesis 18-19. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:5: The author begins with a summary statement of the totality of
the city&rsquo;s conversion thus highlighting the contrast with the
half-hearted efforts of the reluctant prophet. Then be backtracks in
vv. 6-9 to rehearse in more detail the various stages in which this
conversion takes place. The author is clearly a skilful narrator.
[NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:5: &ldquo;believed God&rdquo;: NJBC: believed in God. The people
go beyond believing Jonah&rsquo;s words of warning. The Hebrew word
used here, &rsquo;mn, also occurs in such key texts as Genesis 15:6
and Exodus 14:31, where Abraham and the people of Israel respectively
respond with true faith in God. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:6: &ldquo;covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes&rdquo;:
See also 2 Samuel 3:31 (David commands Joab and those with him); Job
42:6 (Job); Daniel 9:3 (David turns to God in supplication); Matthew
11:21 (Jesus warns Chorazin and Bethsaida). [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:7-9: The reaction of the &ldquo;king of Nineveh&rdquo; (v. 6) is
modelled on Jeremiah 18:7-10: &ldquo;... but if that nation,
concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my
mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at
another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I
will build and plant it ...&rdquo;. He sets a better example than
Jonah! [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:8: &ldquo;Human beings and animals&rdquo;: The incongruous
picture of the animals joining in donning sackcloth and crying out to
God lends a comic note and underlines the totality of the city&rsquo;s
response. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:9: &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;: Like the ship&rsquo;s captain and
the sailors in 1:6, 14, the king does not expect God to react
automatically and inevitably to their repentance: see also Jeremiah
18:7-10. [NJBC] It is pagans, rather than God&rsquo;s people, who
have such extraordinary insight into the sovereign freedom of God.
Jonah, after all, is one of God&rsquo;s people.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>3:10: Repentance and deliverance are themes dominating the story
of Jonah and its use by Jesus in the New Testament: see Matthew
12:38-41 and Luke 11:29-32. [NOAB] Augustine of Hippo noted that
Nineveh was indeed overthrown: &ldquo;overthrown in evil, but rebuilt
in goodness&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalm 62:5-12</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This type of psalm (the song of trust) probably developed as an
expansion of the expression of trust that is a common feature of the
laments. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Confidence is warranted in God alone, since human beings attack
others by word and action. Only God provides true security: human
conditions of wealth and poverty are alike of no enduring
significance: &ldquo;power belongs to God&rdquo; (v. 11). [CAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Superscription: &ldquo;Jeduthun&rdquo;: He is a temple musician
mentioned in 1 Chronicles 25:3; he &ldquo;prophesied with the lyre&rdquo;.
[CAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 1-2,5-7: God is the psalmist&rsquo;s only help. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 3-4: The psalmist&rsquo;s situation: cursed by enemies.
[NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 4,8: &ldquo;Selah&rdquo;: This word is probably a
liturgical direction, added to the original text of the psalm. It may
mean lift up, either to indicate the lifting up of the voices of the
singers in a doxology, or to call for lifted-up instrumental music in
an interlude in the singing. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;Selah&rdquo; is one of the greatest puzzles of the Old
Testament. Its meaning seems to be connected with rising or lifting.
But it is not clear whether the congregation rises or lifts up its
hands, head, or eyes, or whether the music rises at the indicated
points. The word probably indicates that the singing should stop to
allow the congregation an interlude for presenting its homage to God
by some gesture or act of worship. [ICCPs]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1 Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I think it useful to bring together the changes in earthly state
that Paul suggests should preferably be avoided; he presents these as
his opinion (not as a &ldquo;command of the Lord&rdquo;, v. 25, &ldquo;by
way of concession, not of command&rdquo;, v. 6):</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    * Being married (vv. 2-4, vv. 10-11, 27), even if the partner
is an unbeliever (vv. 12-13)</P>
<P>    * The unmarried (vv. 1, 8, 25-26, 27)</P>
<P>    * The widowed (v. 8)</P>
<P>    * Circumcised and uncircumcised (v. 18)</P>
<P>    * Being a slave or being free (v. 21-24)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 17-24: Because the end of the world is fast approaching
(see vv. 26, 29-31), it is better for everyone to remain as is and
not to try to change his or her outward situation. But believers are
free from bondage to this world. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Social status (such as slavery) and religious condition (such as
circumcision) are of no significance for those who are among the
people of God, and they should not seek to heighten their status in
the new community.[CAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 22: In terms of response to the divine call, it does not
matter whether one is a slave or a free person. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 23: &ldquo;You were bought with a price&rdquo;: The idea of
redemption evokes the pre-baptismal nature of slavery to sin. In
Romans 9:3, Paul writes: &ldquo;For I could wish that I myself were
accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people, my
kindred according to the flesh&rdquo;. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 23: &ldquo;slaves of human masters&rdquo;: This is not a
criticism of slavery as such, but of the attitudes of fallen
humanity.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 25: &ldquo;virgins&rdquo;: This group, about whom the
Corinthians had asked, may refer to unmarried but engaged couples, or
possibly a couple married but ascetically committed not to have
sexual relations: see vv. 28, 34, 36-38. Note v. 1, a quotation from
the Christians at Corinth, &ldquo;&lsquo;It is well for a man not to
touch a woman&rsquo;&rdquo;. [NOAB] We cannot be sure who Paul means
by &ldquo;virgins&rdquo; here and elsewhere in the rest of this
chapter. [NJBC] The same Greek word, parthenos, is translated as
&ldquo;fianc&eacute;e&rdquo; in vv. 36-38.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 28: &ldquo;you do not sin&rdquo;: This seems to imply the
breaking of a vow and thus points to spiritual marriage. See comment
on v. 36. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 28: &ldquo;distress in this life&rdquo;: NJBC offers
affliction for the flesh. He sees this as meaning at least a more
complicated life, but perhaps also criticism from the ascetics at
Corinth. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 29-30: Paul considers that it would be silly to make new
commitments when all is going to end. On the imminence of the end,
Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 &ldquo;For the Lord himself,
with a cry of command, with the archangel's call and with the sound
of God's trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ
will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught
up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and
so we will be with the Lord forever&rdquo; and in 1 Corinthians
15:51-52 &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all
die, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead
will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed&rdquo;. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 29: &ldquo;the appointed time has grown short&rdquo;: i.e.
the time before the end of the era, before Christ comes again.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 32: &ldquo;free from anxieties&rdquo;: Anxious concern is a
characteristic of unredeemed existence. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 33: Paul has in mind the complete absorption in one another,
to the exclusion of all other loving relationships, of the newly
married. A married man, being a member of the Christian community of
love, his wife has the first, but not the exclusive, claim on his
affection, [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 34: Note Paul&rsquo;s view that men and women are equal: he
says precisely the same thing to the woman as he has said to the man.
[NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 34: &ldquo;the unmarried woman and the virgin&rdquo;: This
formulation suggests that parthenos (virgin) is being used (at least
in this verse) in a technical sense. If so, it can only mean one who
has entered into a spiritual marriage. See Shepherd of Hermas,
Similitudes 9:11. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 35: Paul gives clear advice but does not impose solutions.
His attitude stands in vivid contrast to the doctrinaire positions
adopted by some at Corinth. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 36-38: The NRSV translation assumes an engaged couple; note
v. 9: &ldquo;But if they are not practising self-control, they should
marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion&rdquo;.
Others, less likely, have interpreted &ldquo;he&rsquo;, &ldquo;his&rdquo;
and &ldquo;him&rdquo; as referring to a father and his daughter (note
that the NRSV footnote says that &ldquo;fianc&eacute;e&rdquo; is
literally virgin), or a master and his slave, and her suitor; the
father gives her in marriage (v. 38). A third possibility is a couple
pledged to virginity in a spiritual marriage, who now wish to enter
into normal conjugal relationships (vv. 3-5). Paul&rsquo;s
preference, in any case, is consistent with vv. 7-8, 24, 26-28.
[NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 36: &ldquo;his fianc&eacute;e&rdquo;: The Greek, parthenos
(literally virgin) can be taken as meaning his daughter, his fianc&eacute;e
or his spiritual wife. Considering each meaning in turn:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    * Though the most traditional, daughter is the least likely;
its only support is gamizein (translated by some as give in
marriage).</P>
<P>    * The probability of parthenos meaning fianc&eacute;e is
seriously diminished by the allusion to sin in v. 28: why should
anyone have thought it sinful for an engaged couple to marry?
Moreover Paul has dealt with this problem in 7:8-9.</P>
<P>    * So Paul is thinking of spiritual marriage. Paul advises that
if they cannot control their sex drive they should have no scruple
about entering into a normal married relationship. He wants them to
be &ldquo;free from anxieties&rdquo; (v. 32) and undistracted (v.
35). [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 37: &ldquo;being under no necessity&rdquo;: Those capable of
sustaining a spiritual marriage should maintain their commitment.
[NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 38: It is a question of what is good for the individual, not
of what is better in principle; however Paul cannot resist mentioning
his personal preference for the single state: see vv. 7-8. His reason
is not intrinsic superiority but the imminence of the end of the era.
[NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 39: &ldquo;free to marry&rdquo;: Paul moves, through
association of ideas, to the issue of second marriages even though he
has already dealt with it in vv. 8-9. Marriage is permanent, but
death gives the surviving partner full freedom to remarry. In Romans
7:2, he says &ldquo;a married woman is bound by the law to her
husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is
discharged from the law concerning the husband&rdquo;. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 39: &ldquo;only in the Lord&rdquo;: i.e. remembering that
she is a Christian. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 40: &ldquo;I think that I too have the Spirit of God&rdquo;:
To NJBC, a massive understatement tinged with irony; however recall
v. 25: &ldquo;I give as my opinion&rdquo;. Perhaps Paul is saying
that he is fairly sure that what he has said is inspired by the Holy
Spirit.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark 1:14-20</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 14-15: See also Matthew 4:12-17 and Luke 4:14-15. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 15: &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo;: This is equivalent to
Matthew&rsquo;s &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven&rdquo;. Jesus means that
all God&rsquo;s past dealings with his creation are coming to climax
and fruition. Jesus taught both the present reality of God&rsquo;s
rule and its future realization. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 16-20: The parallels are Matthew 4:18-22; Luke 5:1-11 and
John 1:35-42. [NOAB]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 16: &ldquo;Sea of Galilee&rdquo;: Other names for this lake
are Sea of Tiberias and Lake of Genesaret. It is 20 kilometres (12
miles) north to south and 12 kilometres (8 miles) east to west.
[NOAB] Mark usually refers to it as &ldquo;the sea&rdquo;: see 2:13;
3:7; 4:1; 5:1, 13, 21.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 16: &ldquo;Simon&rdquo;: He is variously named Simon and
Peter, the latter being the nickname connected with his character.
Andrew is a shadowy character in this gospel: see also 1:29; 3:18;
13:3. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verses 16-20: That the first disciples were uneducated arises from
a too literal reading of Acts 4:13: &ldquo;Now when they [the
Jerusalem sanhedrin] saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized
that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and
recognized them as companions of Jesus&rdquo;. [NJBC] The Zebedee
family ran a fishing business &ldquo;with ... hired men&rdquo;
(employees).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 17: &ldquo;fish for people&rdquo;: The metaphor is best
interpreted against the background of their occupation rather than in
the light of Jeremiah 16:16 (&ldquo;I am now sending for many
fishermen [to the Israelites], says the LORD, and they shall catch
them&rdquo;) or early Christian tradition. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 18: &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;: So compelling were Jesus and
his call that no preparation or getting used to the idea was
necessary; the first disciples required little or no deliberation to
make an enthusiastic commitment. It was customary for Jewish students
to approach a distinguished teacher and attach themselves to him (see
John 1:35-42); here Jesus summons the students. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 18: &ldquo;followed&rdquo;: The Greek word, akoloutheo, is
the technical term for discipleship in the New Testament. [NJBC]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Verse 19: &ldquo;James son of Zebedee and his brother John&rdquo;:
With Peter, these two disciples form a kind of inner circle among the
Twelve: see 1:29-31; 3:16-17; 5:35-43; 9:2-13; 10:35-45; 13:3;
14:32-42. [NJBC]</P>

</P>
<P>Jonah 3:1-5, 10</P>
<P>Commentary on First Reading by Beth Tanner</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Today is the day to tell the story of Jonah, for this is its only
appearance in the regular lectionary cycle.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah is often thought of as a children's story complete with a
whale, but the real message of Jonah is an adult one with an
opportunity to stretch our understanding of God and salvation. The
focus text is of God's second call to Jonah and his less than
enthusiastic response. However, the story of Jonah is a whole piece
and needs to be told from beginning to end.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>One key to preaching Jonah is to not get wrapped up in historical
concerns. If Jonah is a historical figure, the telling of his story
is not for historical purposes. The story of Jonah is a moral tale,
much like Aesop's fables, and is designed to teach the audience
something about themselves. Some background, however, is necessary
for a modern audience to understand the conflict within Jonah's heart
and soul.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>God's instruction in both 1:1 and 3:1 is &quot;to go to Nineveh,
the great city.&quot; To an Israelite like Jonah, this would be
equivalent to announcing today, &quot;Go to Osama Bin Laden's
compound.&quot; Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, the nation that
destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel and held the southern
kingdom of Judah as a vassal for almost one hundred years. Assyria
was more than an enemy; it was a brutal occupying force that forever
changed Israel's fortunes. Jonah is called out by God to go and
prophesy to the enemy. For the story to work as it is intended, we
must look through Jonah's eyes. We should not stand off on the
sidelines and judge, but think of how we would feel in the same
situation. I cannot imagine a worse position! Jonah is told to go
into the enemy city and announce God's judgment.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>We are not told why Jonah runs. Maybe he feared for his life, or
perhaps he thought the enemy did not deserve to be offered a chance.
Either way, Jonah leaves town on the first boat out. We all know that
Jonah ends up in the fish, and it is only here that Jonah finally
does something. He calls out to God; however his words are ones of a
psalm that does not exactly fit the situation. Even inside the fish,
Jonah does not use his own words to speak to God! Deep irony for
someone whose job it is to speak to others.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The lectionary text is God's second command to go to Nineveh. But
it appears that Jonah only learned a very small part of his lesson.
He goes to Nineveh alright, but gives the wimpiest prophecy ever
recorded. Again, instead of condemnation, we need to see the world
through Jonah's eyes. Would we be any more enthusiastic?  These folks
are mortal enemies and the chance of instant death is great.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The response of the people, like the sailors in chapter 2, is
hyperbolic. The king declares that everyone and every beast fast and
be covered with sackcloth and ashes. Imagine the picture; all the
people and all the cows and all the sheep fasting with sackcloth tied
to their backs! The image of the enemy is transformed from one of
fierce occupier to comic supplicant. Just as God has transformed
their hearts, their appearance is markedly changed. Jonah should be
ecstatic; he is the greatest prophet of all! With a couple of words,
he turns a whole nation to God. He should be headed for the
evangelism hall of fame.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The crux of Jonah's story is in the fourth chapter, for the point
of the narrative is not about the conversion of an entire enemy
population. It is about Jonah's reaction to that amazing conversion.
He is not happy, and the reason is because God is being consistent to
God's own self. The NRSV plays down his anger with the words &quot;this
was very displeasing to Jonah and he became angry&quot; (4:1). The
Hebrew reads roughly, &quot;it was evil to Jonah, a great evil, and
his anger burned.&quot; The &quot;it&quot; of Jonah's anger is the
heart of the matter. He tells God why he ran, &quot;for I knew that
you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in
steadfast love and ready to relent from punishing&quot; (4:2). Jonah
is angry at God for the very attributes that Israel has always
depended on for its own salvation (Exodus 34:6-7)! God speaks to
Jonah, trying to explain, but the book ends without resolution and
Jonah goes away mad.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Book of Jonah is read in the Jewish calendar on Yom Kippur,
the Day of Atonement, when Jews confess their sins against God and
neighbor. Offering Jonah to the congregation yields the same type of
contemplation on God's attributes that we too depend on for
salvation. How willing are we to let God be God? Salvation is pure
gift and grace and Jonah's story reminds us that we do not own that
grace, nor is it ours to dole out as we wish. God will be forgiving
because that is the very heart of God.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So the story of this old prophet is much more than a whale tale.
Its message is meant for those mature enough to understand the ways
of God, and to face the ways we try to lay claim to God and God's
gift of grace. My father always told me that if I did not believe
that God would save the most foul of humans, then I did not really
believe in God's power to save my own soul. The book of Jonah puts
Dad's words into action and demands that everyone who hears it
contemplate God's attributes and the meaning and power of salvation.</P>

</P>
<P>Psalm 62:5-12</P>
<P>Commentary on Psalm by Wendell Frerichs</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalm 62 has elements of a Psalm of praise, thanksgiving, lament,
and wisdom.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But it also lacks elements of each of these. Thus, I consider it a
mixed-genre Psalm. In its outline, it is divided into three parts,
which the occurrence of the word 'selah' does.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Who wrote the Psalm and when is impossible to say. Jeduthun,
mentioned in the superscription (cf. 1 Chronicles 16:41-42), is more
likely the forebear of a liturgical family credited with authoring
specific melodies used to chant the Psalms.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The first strophe is essential to a proper understanding of Psalm
62.  True, the utter reliance on God voiced in verses 1-2 is
virtually repeated in verses 5-6. The first word of the Psalm,
translated variously as yes, yea, or truly, occurs six times, helping
to tie the whole together. After seeking for other avenues to a safe
foundation in life, this Psalmist has come to a remarkable
conclusion: only Israel's God, not any other, is utterly reliable.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Various words are used to describe this conclusion: salvation,
rock, fortress, hope, help, shelter, refuge, power, grace. This
person puts his mouth and his words where his heart and soul are. But
it may not always have been so. Verses 3-4 make abundantly clear
that, in the past, his friends, colleagues, or family members were
also trusted and relied upon. Just what undermined this relationship
is not stated. But it was a lesson not to be forgotten.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Why these folks turned on the Psalmist we do not know, but they
did it in a devious way, pretending still to be friendly and
supportive. The poet was caught off-guard and was devastated. Thus,
if we cut out verses 3-4, which our lectionary suggests, we are left
without a clue as to what led the author to the remarkable faith
statements in the rest of the Psalm. Now, no one can reach him to
destroy him. Once he may have been like a building about to collapse,
which anyone could demolish. Not anymore!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Strophe two (verses 5-8) begins as did strophe one, with powerful
words of confidence in God. It surely is remarkable, given the tenor
of verses 3-4. God will not go behind one's back, destroying those
who rely upon him. In the final analysis all strength and power come,
not from nourishment or physical exercise, but from God. We may need
to reassure our souls of this repeatedly! Perhaps the poet, using the
law of asylum, has experienced this personally by fleeing to the
sanctuary and hanging onto the horns of the altar. In any case, the
author is not vengeful or angry (verse 7), only at peace.
Accordingly, this peace becomes the basis of a call to others to
share in this great discovery (verse 8). In the ancient world a
plethora of gods was available for help in time of need. But only the
God of Israel's assembled congregation is their refuge. So, says the
author, do what I did: pray and call for help. You too will then
become as confident as I am. Here we reach the high point of strophe
two, if not of the whole Psalm. Remember this insight when troubles
come, as they surely will.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Strophe three (verses 9-12) does not begin as the previous two
did. Instead of reflecting the negative experience depicted in
strophe one, the author now evaluates all humans as unable to provide
security. Compared to God, humans are nothing. Even those who have
amassed a fortune and those who exercise power cannot be relied upon.
These are illusions which may quickly disappear. Further, how was
this wealth or power accumulated? No doubt at someone else's expense.
Like the Wisdom Literature, these verses remind and warn those who
rely on such things to beware.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>God has often spoken of such matters (verse 11, cf. the Prophets).
But not all have heeded. Thus, once again the people are told and God
(verse 12) is finally addressed. Praise is not just advised for
others, but given to the Faithful One, the gracious God of Israel.
For centuries this was the central message of the Temple worship
services. Sacred history, too, interpreted the past and present as
the arena where God was active on their behalf.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>All of us need friends, family, and community to rely on. But
sometimes they let us down, hopefully not as absolutely as the
Psalmist experienced. It can be disillusioning. One may be tempted to
lash out, to give up hope. Here is a text which shows the way out of
such a predicament. There is someone whom we can rely upon
completely. Our Lord is reliable when others fail us. It may also be
our IRA's, or investments, which prove to be less than secure. What
we have laid aside for the future may have eroded considerably. We
lose confidence in capitalism, in CEOs. But should we also lose faith
in God?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>From experience and the Bible, we learn that this world and the
people in it are unreliable. Yet our experience and the Bible also
testify that God is a secure foundation upon whom to build. The
sermon should be personal testimony to the congregation, as this
Psalm is. It should  include God's promises to us, as well as talk
about God. Confident witness is not narrow-minded bigotry. People
need help in living in the real world.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The last two lines, depending upon the translation, may be a
problem for evangelical Christians. Are we rewarded according to our
deeds? This author is not speaking about the afterlife or eternal
salvation which we know is given by grace alone. Jesus Christ did die
for our sins. That makes the witness of this Psalm even more
profound.</P>

<P>1 Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P>Commentary on Second Reading by Arland J. Hultgren</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Second Lesson prescribed for any given Sunday in the Revised
Common Lectionary does not usually cohere with the core message of
the Gospel for the Day.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Except on special occasions, it is typically a passage that is
part of a continuous reading within Acts, an epistle, or Revelation,
and given attention over several weeks.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But there are fortuitous occasions when the Second Lesson does
cohere thematically with the Gospel for the Day. This day is one of
them. The lesson from 1 Corinthians, like the Gospel (Mark 1:14-20),
has to do with time and the place of the believer within it.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In Mark 1:15, Jesus proclaims: &quot;The time (kairos) is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe
in the good news.&quot; The moment is one of urgency, for God's reign
is breaking into human history. Our reading begins with similar
urgency: &quot;I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time
(kairos) has grown short&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:29). Paul expects the
imminent arrival of Christ in his glory, when &quot;the present form
of this world&quot; passes away (7:31), and that makes all the
difference in the world as to how one should live.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Greek term kairos carries several nuances within the New
Testament. Among its most widely used meanings, the word can mean
&quot;significant time,&quot; &quot;appointed time&quot; (a time
determined by God), &quot;critical time,&quot; or even some
combination of these. Within the two texts assigned for today, all of
these meanings are present. The time is significant, appointed, and
critical, whether it is the moment when the reign of God over all
things dawns upon the earth, as proclaimed by Jesus, or the moment at
the eve of Christ's coming in glory, as proclaimed by Paul.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>What Paul writes in 1 Corinthians is a response to questions from
the community of believers at Corinth. Prior to the passage assigned
for today, he has taken up a series of issues. He writes that the
single life is better, but recommends marriage to help prevent sexual
immorality (7:1-9). He urges that believers not divorce one another,
although conceding that divorce might be necessary in some cases
(7:10-16). And he counsels those who become Christians not to make
changes. For example, slaves should not think that they must become
free, but accept freedom if it is offered (7:11-24).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now Paul turns again to the matter of singles and married couples.
He recommends that they remain in their present state (7:25-28). The
basis for his recommendation is: &quot;in view of the impending
crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are&quot; (7:26). In
short, Paul's imminent eschatology (his sense of the end of all
things coming soon) governs all that is being said. It is the
foundation for the way of life that he recommends.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This entire discussion leads us to the brief passage assigned for
today. It is especially important to notice Paul's use of the words
&quot;as though not&quot; (ho&#772;s me&#772;) five times over in
these three verses. So, Paul says, one is to live &quot;as though
not&quot; married, mourning, rejoicing, making purchases, and (in
summation) dealing with the world in general.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Basic to his thinking is that one is to disengage from the world,
for all is transitory. There is no point in becoming consumed or even
entangled with the world and its concerns, for the &quot;present form
of this world is passing away.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>However, this approach is not the sum and substance of everything
Paul has to say concerning life in this world. There is plenty more.
In Romans 12:9-21, Paul provides a sustained discussion on Christian
behavior within the community of believers (12:9-13) and in the
larger community outside (12:14-21). In Romans 13:1-10, he urges that
believers should be subject to the governing powers and should
practice love for one another. In Philippians 4:8-9, he endorses and
commends basic values and virtues as giving guidance for the
Christian life. Twice in his letters, he sums up the Ten Commandments
with the Love Commandment (Romans 13:9-10; Galatians 5:14).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Amidst these examples, it is helpful to put side-by-side two
words: &quot;disengagement&quot; and &quot;engagement.&quot; In his
ethical thinking, and in our passage for today, Paul calls upon
persons of faith to disengage from the world and its ways of living.
One should step back and see how being entangled with it can be a
captivity preventing one from living the new life in Christ. But that
is not the end of the matter, for we continue to live in this world
and have to deal with it. In Paul's way of thinking, disengagement is
not an end in itself. Rather, being disengaged and set free, a person
can engage the world from the perspective of being one who is &quot;in
Christ.&quot; And Paul provides a lot of exhortation in his letters
concerning that life, as mentioned above.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>People who hear this passage read at worship will find it
puzzling. They do not have a sense of the imminent coming of Christ,
and they can hardly live day-to-day &quot;as though not&quot; having
dealings with the world. It is important therefore, if this text is
the basis for a sermon, to set it in the context of 1 Corinthians and
within the larger framework of Paul's ethical teaching, as done here.</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P>In the end, the primary message of this text is that nothing in
this world can compare to the eternal fellowship we have with God and
Christ. Dealing with the world is inevitable and important &#61485;
we need to deal with it well for the sake of our families, our
nation, and ourselves. But we need to maintain an &quot;eschatological
reserve,&quot; knowing that this is not all there is, for we look to
the eternal beyond that which is passing away.  Still, we should
remain invested in the world and its ongoing concerns. Indeed, those
who pray for the kingdom and expect Christ to come in glory are bound
to be engaged in the world and its struggles. Knowing the certainty
of God's ultimate reign beyond history, we work to align the present
and future with it.</P>

<P>Mark 1:14-20</P>
<P>Commentary on Gospel by Stephen Hultgren</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The text consists of two parts: a summary of Jesus' preaching in
1:14-15; and a call story in 1:16-20.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>These two parts are connected by the sense of urgency brought on
via the proclamation of the reign of God.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark tells us that after John was &quot;handed over&quot;
(paradothe&#772;nai), Jesus returned to Galilee and began to preach
the gospel. The NRSV translates paradothe&#772;nai as &quot;arrested,&quot;
however, the Greek verb has a much fuller sense. It includes an
allusion to John's death, for the verb paradido&#772;mi is used in
Mark and elsewhere in the New Testament to speak of Jesus' being
handed over to death (e.g., Mark 14:21; Romans 4:25; 1 Corinthians
11:23). Consider the evidence linking these two men's deaths. Both
men were prophets who offended the powers that be. Both died violent
deaths. Moreover, Mark placed similar passages questioning the
identity of Jesus before the account of John's death (6:14-16), and
before the first of the three passion predictions (8:27-30), which
suggests that he saw a parallel between the two men's deaths. As has
been long observed, the cross of Jesus casts a long shadow over the
Gospel of Mark. Thus, already in Mark 1:14 the mention of John's
being &quot;handed over&quot; raises the specter of Jesus' death. For
Mark, Jesus' kingdom ministry takes place, from the very beginning,
under the shadow of the cross.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In 1:15 there follows a summary of Jesus' preaching. Such
summaries are common throughout the synoptic gospels (cf. Matthew
4:23; 9:35). Mark appears to have constructed this summary on
material from Jesus' preaching. The very fact that Mark places this
summary of Jesus' preaching of the gospel after mention of John's
being &quot;handed over&quot; may be based on tradition containing
Jesus' view of history such as is recorded in Luke 16:16, namely,
that &quot;the law and the prophets were in effect until John came;
since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed.&quot;
With the end of John's ministry comes the end of one stage of
history. Now, Jesus and his gospel come to center stage. Jesus'
ministry is the center of all history.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The reliance on traditional material is evident in the rest of
1:15. The proclamation that &quot;the kingdom of God has come near&quot;
(e&#772;ggiken he&#772; basileia tou theou) is found elsewhere in
Jesus' sayings (Matthew 10:7; Luke 10:9, 11). In addition, Jesus'
healings and exorcisms were particularly connected to the coming of
the kingdom (Matthew 12:28, Luke 11:20; cf. Matthew 10:7-8, Luke
10:9). It is unnecessary to enter the old debate of whether Jesus
meant that the kingdom of God had actually come (realized
eschatology), or whether the kingdom of God was near but not yet here
(future eschatology). It is possible that Jesus thought that both
were true. Wherever he conducted his ministry, there God's reign was
actively coming into being, even if the kingdom might not come fully
until the future.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The announcement that &quot;the time (kairos) is fulfilled
(peple&#772;ro&#772;tai)&quot; also has the ring of tradition. Luke
similarly begins his account of Jesus' Galilean ministry with Jesus
preaching in his hometown synagogue in Nazareth about the &quot;year
of the Lord's favor&quot; that Isaiah had prophesied (Isaiah 61:2).
Jesus then said, that time had been fulfilled (peple&#772;ro&#772;tai)
in the people's hearing that very day (Luke 4:19, 21).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Interestingly, Isaiah 60:22, coming just before the part of Isaiah
quoted in Luke 4, speaks of the time (Greek: kairos) when God would
bring about the restoration of Israel. Possibly this is the source of
the statement about the kairos in Mark 1:15. It is likely that the
latter half of Isaiah lies behind Jesus' eschatological vision, and
is the source of his understanding of the kingdom. Isaiah 61:1
characterizes the time of the Lord's favor as a time of preaching the
good news (Greek: euaggelizesthai). Isaiah 52:7 connects the
preaching of good news with the proclamation of God's reign. Thus,
the good news of the kingdom of God is that the one true God, with
his life and peace and truth, is about to establish his rule over the
world. All other opposing powers&mdash;whether human powers or sin or
evil or death&mdash;are destined to end their rule.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>We have seen that the announcement that the kingdom of God is near
also appears in Matthew 10:7 and Luke 10:9, 11. Closely connected
with this announcement in the tradition known to Luke (a so-called Q
tradition), was the call to repentance (Luke 10:13). Perhaps the
juxtaposition of the announcement of the reign of God and the call to
repentance in the summary of Mark 1:15 is rooted in similar
traditional material. In any case, the theological basis for the
juxtaposition is clear. Announcing that God's reign is near has the
consequence of an urgent call for repentance, that is, aligning one's
values and way of life with God's ways. In today's epistle reading (1
Corinthians 7:29-31) Paul similarly calls for an examination of our
priorities in light of the kairos.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The second section (Mark 1:16-20) then illustrates what the urgent
call of the kingdom looks like. Jesus, walking along the Sea of
Galilee, sees the two brothers Simon and Andrew, fishermen, casting
their nets in the sea. He calls them to follow, and immediately, in
obedience, they leave their nets and follow him. The same happens
with James and John. The kai euthys (&quot;and immediately&quot;) of
1:18 and 1:20, a favorite turn of phrase of Mark, gives expression to
the urgency of the call. The time is here, God's kingdom is near;
there is no time to lose!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>It is striking that these four men would drop everything to follow
Jesus if they did not already know him. Indeed, some scholars have
speculated that they actually knew Jesus, or knew about him, before
he called them into discipleship (cf. John 1:35-40). Whatever the
history of the relationship between Jesus and these four men may have
been, however, the story gives effective expression to the urgency of
the call to discipleship.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Consider also that Mark portrays Jesus' proclamation of the
kingdom coming not only as a gift (&quot;good news&quot;), but also
with a demand (&quot;repent&quot;). Writing as a Lutheran, I find
this a salutary warning that we dare not limit the force of Jesus'
preaching of the kingdom by imposing upon it a rigid Law-Gospel grid.
If we try to impose such a grid on his preaching and teaching, we
will not understand them in their integrity. To be sure, the
indicative (&quot;the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God has come
near&quot;) precedes the imperative (&quot;repent and believe in the
good news&quot;). What humans do comes as a response to God's
prevenient action. Still, we must not overlook that the one who
promises the kingdom to sinners is the same one who calls sinners to
repentance and who calls disciples to give up all that they have to
follow him. To put it in Pauline terms, Christ is my life (cf.
Philippians 1:21); my life is a total gift from him. Therefore I must
also be willing and prepared to forfeit everything for him
(Philippians 3:7-8; cf. Mark 8:35). Since in Jesus everything is
given to me, in Jesus everything is demanded of me. The four
disciples' willingness to throw in their lot completely with Jesus
illustrates that attitude.</P>

<P>Jonah 3;1-10</P>
<P>Psalm 62:5-12</P>
<P>I Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P>Mark 1:14-20</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Today&rsquo;s scripture readings invite us to explore the
interplay of decision and transformation on both a personal and
corporate basis. Decision-making is inherent in human, and all
creaturely, experience. Each moment arises from our creative response
to our environment, previous decisions, personal health and history,
the call of God, and other conscious and unconscious factors. While
we are greatly determined by our environment and the impact of the
past, each moment provides the opportunity to choose anew and take a
small step toward personal and communal transformation. Small steps
toward transformation, grounded in our ability to respond to the data
of experience, may eventually lead to great changes for us and our
communities. Life is a dynamic &ldquo;call and response&rdquo; in
which we creatively respond to God&rsquo;s call in every moment of
existence. Our response is seldom &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo; but faithful
choosing allows us to inject positive values that contribute to the
healing of the persons and communities with which we interact.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Much to our surprise, God inspires our creativity and
decision-making. God has not pre-determined our choices, or chosen
the most important events in our lives without our input (Rick
Warren), but rejoices in the holy adventure of human creativity and
partnership with God. (For a spirituality of creativity, see Epperly,
Holy Adventure, Upper Room, 2008).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In order to get the full impact of the Jonah reading, I suggest
that the preacher reflect at least indirectly on Job in its entirety
in her or his study, sermon preparation, and in the passages of the
day, rather than limiting her or himself to the passages from the
lectionary (Jonah 3:1-5, 10), as an example of the interdependence of
divine call and human response. (At the very least, he or she should
include Jonah 3:1-10, or, better yet, the entirety of chapters three
and four, as an example of God&rsquo;s universal love.)  The
reluctant prophet Jonah presents Nineveh with the call to decision.
One path leads to destruction; the other to peace and prosperity.
While we may hesitate to identify divine activity with the
destruction of nations, we can definitely affirm that the actions of
persons and nations have consequences for good or for ill. This was
the case of &ldquo;godless&rdquo; Nineveh and it is surely the case
for the nations of the earth, including the United States of America
and Canada. In the interdependence of life, we often reap what we
sow, personally, congregationally, and nationally. The ongoing
economic crisis, terrorist threat, unease in the Middle East,
starvation in Africa, and global climate change are hardly
accidental, but the result of decisions made by political leaders,
nations, everyday people, and corporate entities. We are now reaping
a harvest, seeded by greed, individualism, nationalism, resentment,
short-sightedness, and materialism. Can we choose life rather than
death when faced with such complex and intricately connected threats?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The United States of America has just inaugurated a new president.
Will the audacity of hope triumph over the passivity of entropy?
Faithfulness to God calls us to choose again and again, and take new
paths toward life rather than destruction for our planet, nation, and
ourselves.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah predicts destruction for Nineveh in its entirety. For once,
the people hear God&rsquo;s call and in response, the king assumes
the role of national theologian&mdash;&ldquo;Who knows? God may
relent and change [God&rsquo;s] mind; [God] may turn from [God&rsquo;s]
fierce anger, so that we do not perish.&rdquo; While we may not
attribute our current crises to the hand of God, the king&rsquo;s
question and affirmation invites us to see ourselves as
decision-makers whose choices shape the future, rather than passive
victims of fate. The passage from Jonah implies that the future is
still open, both for us and for God.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;God changed [God&rsquo;s] mind!&rdquo; While mortals cannot
fully fathom the divine intentionality either in the affairs of
persons or nations, this passage presents us with the image of a
lively, decision-making God, who is not bound by the past, who can do
new things, and bring forth new possibilities. God calls to Nineveh
through the words of Jonah, but God also responds to their decisions.
As we look at our personal, communal, and planetary lives, what
divine possibilities and dreams are we thwarting as a result of our
passivity, habitual behaviors, and individualism? What new energies
of transformation might be released if we turned from our
self-centeredness to earth-centeredness and God-centeredness? The
living God is &ldquo;new every morning.&rdquo; New things can happen
to both God and humankind that call upon new decisions in the
divine-human adventure.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalm 62 counsels us to listen for the voice of God in times of
turbulence. Trust in God calls us to be patient and await the
guidance that we need. Sometimes the best spiritual advice is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
do something, sit there&rdquo; until the way ahead becomes clear.
God&rsquo;s steadfast love embraces us and will provide us with a way
of transformation even in challenging times. Our hope is not in
individualism, materialism, or social standing, but in the
faithfulness of God who is our refuge and salvation. With faith in
God, we can creatively respond to the personal, congregational,
national, and global crises that currently confront us. Liberated
from the confines of self-interest, we can intuit the outlines of
God&rsquo;s vision of Shalom for ourselves and the planet. We can
embrace a larger sense of self and personal well-being that includes
the well-being of the whole earth.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>On January 13, my wife Kate and I celebrated our 30th anniversary.
You can be sure that the passages from I Corinthians 7:29-31 were not
read at our anniversary dinner, wedding, or any wedding I have
witnessed. &ldquo;Those who have wives be as they have none&rdquo; is
Paul&rsquo;s counsel in light of his belief that he was living in the
last days of planet earth. While Paul&rsquo;s timetable was obviously
inaccurate, still, there may be some wisdom in Paul&rsquo;s
admonitions. First, he tells us that &ldquo;the appointed time has
grown short.&rdquo; Even those of us who are not looking toward the
literal return of Jesus can find wisdom in this passage, for we have
heard that the time is short and we experience threats in abundance.
As we look at the possibility of global catastrophe, many of us
wonder if the time is short, not only for us, but more significantly
for our children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The shortness of time, the quickly passing moment, calls us to
wise decision-making. Perhaps, the Corinthians passage is an
invitation to take this moment seriously as the meeting place of
past, present, and future; history and possibility; the impact of
past decisions and the hope of transformation. In light of the
perpetual perishing of each moment&rsquo;s experience, the passage
calls us to sit lightly with the world. Creative detachment enables
us to proclaim &ldquo;this is the day that God has made&rdquo; and
then embrace the new possibilities God presents us in each moment&rsquo;s
birth. Decision requires letting go of the past, even the good past,
in order to embrace the new creation God is imaging for us, our
congregations, and the world. This morning, as I look at my the
blazing fire in our living room, it is clear to me that creative
transformation always requires change and destruction, a new
configuration of wood to fire, or old habits to new adventures.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark&rsquo;s gospel presents the power of divine call and
response. Following John&rsquo;s death, Jesus proclaims a gospel of
transformation and repentance in light of God&rsquo;s coming reign.
Turn around, embrace new life, and live toward God&rsquo;s future.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>While we might suspect that Peter and his friends have an ongoing
relationship with Jesus prior to his call to decision, eventually
they must choose to stay where they are or move forward on God&rsquo;s
holy adventure. They must let go of old patterns of relationship,
occupation, and faith in order to embrace new possibilities. No
doubt, there was plenty of internal and relational resistance before
they laid down their fishing nets. We hope they consulted with their
spouses and business partners. Still, there comes the moment to
decide and while these moments of decision may come over and over to
us, there are times when we can no longer sit on the sidelines, but
must say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to God&rsquo;s dream for our lives. In
saying &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; we let go of one world, one set of values,
habits and practices, to embrace a new world with new behaviors.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>God calls us to decision and our decisions will make a difference.
While the call of God may not be as immediate and crisis-laden as
that of revival preachers such as Jonah and Billy Graham, God is
always calling us to decision &ndash; to choose for life, beauty, and
justice&mdash;in the context of the complexities of our current
historical and personal context.</P>
<P>Today&rsquo;s preacher needs to remind the congregation that God
wants us to be creative and that God seeks novelty and adventure. We
don&rsquo;t need to worry about perfection or achieving all of our
goals, openness and fidelity to God&rsquo;s adventurous vision is
enough to open new pathways of creativity in our churches and our
lives.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>On this &ldquo;Ecumenical Sunday,&rdquo; celebrating the Week of
Christian Unity, preachers can remind their congregations that we can
choose to affirm creatively both unity and diversity in matters of
faith. We can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and thus learn from different
worship styles or theological positions. We can choose to integrate
the gifts of our own tradition and theological perspective with the
insights of other traditions and theological perspectives, thus
creating new and adventurous forms of faith and action for our time.</P>

</P>
<P>Jonah or Jesus?  Which of these is the prophet after the heart of
God?  We are spoiled for drama with this week&rsquo;s texts.  On the
one hand, we have Mark&rsquo;s play that hurtles us from scene to
scene with dramatic suddenness, and on the other, the second act of
the drama of Jonah - surely the highest point of biblical comedy. 
And in all the parallels of the prophetic announcement of Good News,
the thing that stands out most clearly is the fact that Jesus is
himself part of the Good News he announces, whereas Jonah decidedly
is not!</P>
<P>Reluctant prophet of Yahweh (Jonah 3: 1-5, 10)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Act 2, Scene 1: The Beach.  The curtain rises on a huge pile of
the stomach contents of a whale (yes, let&rsquo;s call the great fish
a whale, shall we?  It makes for a whale of a story, anyhow!). 
Suddenly, the voice of Yahweh is heard: &ldquo;Jonah, let&rsquo;s
talk about you and Nineveh again, shall we?&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Act 1 began almost identically.  Yahweh calls Jonah to go to the
&ldquo;great city&rdquo; of Nineveh and prophesy against it.  Jonah
foolishly responds by trying to flee from Yahweh.  There is a
delicious, hilarious irony to the chapter.  Imagine trying to hide
from Yahweh!  We see Jonah, crouched among the sailors on a ship,
apparently hoping that Yahweh won&rsquo;t spot him!  Jonah ends up in
the belly of the fish, which is his place of conversion.  He refers
to the belly of the fish as the belly of Sheol - the grave (2:2).  He
prays, and Yahweh causes the fish to vomit Jonah up on to dry land! 
Imagine it - the fish swims into the shallows of a bay, and from
several yards offshore, gives a mighty heave of the stomach.  And in
the fountain of stomach contents that fly through the air and land on
the shore, there we see the prophet of Yahweh.  Well, we probably
don&rsquo;t, at first: he&rsquo;s indistinguishable from the rest of
the stomach contents!  And Yahweh addresses the pile of dead fish,
plankton, seaweed, shells etc: &ldquo;Jonah, get up!&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now the pile begins to shake and dissolve, and a bedraggled,
stinking human being emerges.  It is Jonah!  This time, Jonah&rsquo;s
only response is to set off for Nineveh without a word.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He arrives at the &ldquo;great city&rdquo;.  Everything in the
story is in hyperbole, exaggerated for comic effect.  The city is
apparently three day&rsquo;s walk across - some 108 miles!  The
irony, of course, is that this is precisely the length of time that
Jonah has wasted in the whale&rsquo;s stomach!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But look at his sermon - all of 8 words long!  Hardly a great
sermon - but note how astoundingly, ridiculously effective it is. 
The people believe, proclaim a fast and put on sackcloth.  Everyone! 
And when the news reaches the palace, the king decrees that even the
animals must don sackcloth and repent.  Has there ever been such a
wholehearted response to the word of the Lord?  And so, in verse 10,
Yahweh changes his mind about visiting calamity on the city.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The whole focus of the book, however, is not Nineveh, or the
success of the prophet&rsquo;s message.  Rather, it is about the
prophet himself.  In the very next verse (4:1), Jonah is displeased! 
He goes into a grand sulk, and rails at God.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;I knew it!  I knew this would happen!  I knew you are a
gracious and merciful God, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love
and ready to relent from punishing!  That&rsquo;s why I ran away in
the first place!  And see?  I was right all along!  No fire from
heaven, and all that satisfying judgement!  Instead, you&rsquo;ve let
them off!&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah is furious because Yahweh is loving and merciful, so that
what he fondly hoped would be Bad News to the people of Nineveh
turned out to be Good News after all.  God&rsquo;s love and mercy
mean that God always desires the best for us.  This is a book about a
prophet who bitterly resents the fact that the God whom he serves is
a God of love and salvation.  It is a comedy about the contrast
between God and one of God&rsquo;s people.  The book ends with Yahweh
chiding Jonah: &ldquo;Jonah, isn&rsquo;t it right that I be concerned
about Nineveh?  After all, there are more than 12,000 people there,
and many animals!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come, follow me!&rdquo; (Mark 1: 14-20)</P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>We&rsquo;re in Act 1, scenes 4 &amp;5.  This is a very different
sort of play.  &ldquo;Scenes&rdquo; is actually a misleading term:
&ldquo;vignettes&rdquo; is more accurate.  We&rsquo;ve been hurtled
from the Prologue to Scene 1 (the appearance and preaching of John
outside Jerusalem) to Scene 2 (the appearance and baptism of Jesus)
to Scene 3 (Jesus wrestling with Satan and the wild animals in the
wilderness).  Here in Scene 4 (Galilee), the stage is cleared of
John, that other great character.  He&rsquo;s been arrested.  He&rsquo;s
offstage.  Mark begins his focus on the great central character of
his drama, Jesus.  Here in v14 is the Man and his Message - his
Gospel.  This is a summary statement of Jesus&rsquo; message:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>    &ldquo;The time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of God has drawn
near.  Repent and believe in the Good News!&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>We have already been given strong hints that the Kingdom of God is
something that is going to cause huge ructions.  This is a message of
confrontation between the powers of Imperial Rome and the religious
authority of the Temple and its leaders.  This isn&rsquo;t a message
that will be received with the enthusiasm that Nineveh showed!  The
message of the Kingdom will set Jesus and those who respond on a
collision course with those who will oppose it.  It is the beginning
of a life and death struggle.  This is not a message to be
assimilated quietly and easily.  To &ldquo;repent and believe&rdquo;
requires a fundamental reorientation and the embracing of a whole new
set of values and norms.  It will change forever the way in which
those who respond - the disciples - will view the world and live in
it.  It is a call to take up the Struggle against the Strong Man and
all the powers that hold the world and its people captive - demons,
sickness, hatred, discrimination, political and religious
authorities.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>That is the point of Scene 5 - the lakeshore near Capernaum. 
Jesus calls - and the fishermen get up and follow immediately!  There
is no demurring, or argument, or demand for further details or
explanation.  It&rsquo;s as though they recognise in an instant both
the authority of the one calling them and the truth and urgency of
the message.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>These first disciples show us what Jesus means by &ldquo;repent&rdquo;.
 In this context, it doesn&rsquo;t mean to don sackcloth and ashes. 
It isn&rsquo;t a call to a religious act.  It takes us to the root
meaning of the word - to change one&rsquo;s whole way of thinking and
being in the world.  &ldquo;Stop living how you are doing!  Change
your plans for your life&rsquo;s work and your future!  You thought
you were going to be fishermen?  You&rsquo;re going to fish - for
people!  You thought you were going to live out your days in this
village on the lakeshore?  You&rsquo;re never coming back here!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The time is fulfilled&rdquo; (Mark 1:14/1 Corinthians 7:
29-31)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To announce &ldquo;The time is fulfilled!&rdquo; was political,
social and religious dynamite in Jesus&rsquo; context.  It meant that
all that God had promised was coming to pass.  The time of waiting
and agonising was over.  Jesus was telling the people that all they
had been waiting, hoping and yearning for was about to happen.  Time
(as they had known it) was running out.  This is the equivalent of
Jonah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Forty days - and then it happens!&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1 Corinthians 7 is similarly Paul&rsquo;s message that time is
running out.  Paul was expecting Jesus to return at any moment. 
After all, Jesus had promised that the fulfilment of everything was
going to take place within the life of that very generation.  We are
right in the middle of one of the earliest New Testament shocks - the
delay of the Parousia.  In fact, this is written as expectation of
Jesus&rsquo; return is reaching fever pitch, before disillusionment,
puzzlement and despair, and before Paul&rsquo;s Thessalonian
correspondence.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Paul is not anti-marriage, or anti-sex, or anti mourning,
celebration, or commerce.  He&rsquo;s saying, though, that these
things require energy, time, priorities, reserves and long-term
planning which is fine if you have time stretching ahead, but wholly
inappropriate now, given that Jesus is coming back at any minute. 
These priorities belong to the world as we have always known it, and
that world is in the very process of passing away (7:31).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Paul was wrong about timing.  So was Jesus.  Yet he was right
about the urgency of the gospel call.  The Kingdom of God is indeed
at hand.  We still stand at the moment of decision: are we going to
live life as though the world is still held captive, nothing has
changed and we can plan as we have always done, or are we going to
recognise that God is at work right now, transforming the world into
the Kingdom?  Because if the latter is true, that requires urgent
decision and change.</P>
<P>Living with God (Psalm 62: 5-12)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The comedy of Jonah runs the risk of disguising the fact that God
is not easy to live with.  God&rsquo;s call radically alters life -
and not necessarily for the better.  That is certainly true in the
sense that we are not called to The Quiet Life&rdquo;!  For Jonah, it
involves shipwreck, spending time in a fish&rsquo;s belly, and having
your worst fears about your calling coming true.  For the disciples
and for Paul, it means leaving everything and being called to follow
a person and a way that leads to isolation, suffering, grief,
misunderstanding and ultimately, death.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>One of the most difficult things about living with God is God! 
God is no more a &ldquo;tame God&rdquo; than Aslan is a tame lion (as
Mr Tumnus the fawn reminds Lucy in The Lion, the Witch and the
Wardrobe).  God is sovereign.  Not only is God not in hock to our
expectations and demands that God act in certain ways, but God is
also curiously and disturbingly as absent and inscrutable as God is
present and knowable.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Look at the experience of Yahweh reflected by the psalmist in this
week&rsquo;s reading: in v5, his soul &ldquo;waits for God in
silence&rdquo;.  Waiting for God to speak, to act, to reassure, to
comfort, to be palpably present - behind this wonderfully faithful
statement lies agony and doubt and the fear of abandonment.  The
decision to &ldquo;wait for God&rdquo; is a deliberate choice made in
the face of (more reasonable?) anger and rejection.  Yahweh is silent
- and the psalmist is likewise reduced to dumb waiting: to holding on
and to gritting his teeth until Yahweh deigns to speak and act - to
&ldquo;remember&rdquo; the psalmist.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The ringing assertions of Yahweh&rsquo;s character (&rdquo;my
rock, my salvation, my fortress, my refuge&rdquo;) are almost a &ldquo;hope
against hope&rdquo; - a determination that Yahweh is all these
things, even though experience seems to shout out that the contrary
is true.  This is true of the experience of God.  God does not
conform to our expectations of how God should be and act, or how God
should treat those whom God calls.  God is sovereign - beyond
comprehension and criticism.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And yet, look at what the psalmist says without any sense of irony
in v8: &ldquo;Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your
heart before him!&rdquo;  This is something we can learn about Old
Testament spirituality: for all Yahweh&rsquo;s sovereignty and
apparent remoteness, it is absolutely appropriate to pour out one&rsquo;s
heart to this God.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This is about honesty.  It&rsquo;s the honesty of a Jonah who can
rail a Yahweh about his disappointment and frustration.  It&rsquo;s
the Gethsemane honesty of Jesus, who will beg God as an
intimately-known Father to let him off the hook.  And most
astoundingly of all, it&rsquo;s the honesty of someone who believes
that their feelings and experiences make a difference to how God will
choose to act!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Power belongs to God (v11), but so does steadfast love (v12). 
&ldquo;Steadfast love&rdquo; is not abstract theology: it is the
testimony of someone who has lived the mystery of God firsthand, and
can say, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy.  It isn&rsquo;t always pleasant.
 But God can be trusted - because God loves, cares and listens. 
Trust in him at all times, O people!&rdquo;</P>
<P>So - Jonah or Jesus?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah was the living contradiction of the character of the God who
called him.  The messenger was definitely not part of the Good News! 
Part of the good news for the Ninevites was that God is not like
God&rsquo;s people!  The people of Nineveh were being saved from
precisely the sort of attitudes exemplified by the prophet.  Mark
presents us with a stark contrast.  The Kingdom is near because Jesus
is present.  Jesus is the living presence of the Good News.  To be
committed to the Kingdom is therefore also to be committed to Jesus. 
Jesus is the Good News, in this sense.  And therefore, like those
first disciples, we are called to come and follow - to repent and
believe in the Good News.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Amen.</P>

<P>The Third Sunday After Epiphany - Year B</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>JONAH 3:1-5,10                         One should read the whole
parable 
</P>
<P>of Jonah at one sitting.  Most people remember only the story of
the fish 
</P>
<P>that swallowed Jonah.  That was, in fact, a metaphor for Israel&rsquo;s
exile in 
</P>
<P>Babylon.  Written as a missionary tract, the story calls Israel to
a 
</P>
<P>mission of proclaiming God's saving goodness and mercy among all
peoples - 
</P>
<P>even Israel's worst enemies in Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. 
The story 
</P>
<P>ends with Jonah getting his come-uppance for his too narrow belief
that 
</P>
<P>divine compassion extends only to Israel.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>PSALM 62:5-12                          This poem presents the same
</P>
<P>elements of universal justice and compassion because of the
psalmist&rsquo;s 
</P>
<P>confident trust in God's steadfast love.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1 CORINTHIANS 7:29-31                  In this brief passage Paul
appears 
</P>
<P>to counter the traditional view of Christian family values.  But
is he 
</P>
<P>really suggesting that marriage is not the best thing for young
men and 
</P>
<P>women in the Corinthian congregation?  The key words are: &quot;...the
</P>
<P>appointed time has grown short....&quot; At this stage in his
ministry, Paul 
</P>
<P>was looking for the imminent return of Christ in glory.  He wanted
all 
</P>
<P>faithful people to give themselves wholly to preparing for that
event.  
</P>
<P>Marriage and family responsibilities would detract from their
commitment.  
</P>
<P>So also would worldly possessions.  It was excessive attachment to
these 
</P>
<P>relationships, not their existence, which Paul decried.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>MARK 1:14-20                           Mark's version of Jesus
calling his 
</P>
<P>first disciples is quite different from what we read last week in
John 
</P>
<P>1:35-51.  John the Baptist had been imprisoned, but Jesus took his
place 
</P>
<P>preaching repentance and the good news of God's salvation.  The
calling of 
</P>
<P>the four fishermen occurred entirely on Jesus' initiative, not as
a result 
</P>
<P>of their curiosity.  This was in keeping with Mark's presentation
of 
</P>
<P>Jesus' messiahship being hidden until Peter's declaration toward
the end 
</P>
<P>of Jesus' ministry (Mark 8:27-33).  However they were called, the 
</P>
<P>disciples' response was immediate.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>A MORE COMPLETE ANALYSIS:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>JONAH 3:1-5,10   It would be instructive to set aside the other
readings 
</P>
<P>and spend the whole of the time for scripture during worship in
reading 
</P>
<P>aloud this remarkable tale.  The prayer of Jonah in 2:2-9 could be
omitted 
</P>
<P>in such a reading.  Scholars regard it as a later addition to the
original 
</P>
<P>story because it interrupts the natural flow of the narrative and 
</P>
<P>represents the very opposite view of the basic story.  On the
other hand, 
</P>
<P>the prayer mocks Israelite piety exemplified in Jonah whose sole
concern 
</P>
<P>was his own reputation for the accuracy of prediction or a
restriction of 
</P>
<P>divine compassion to Israel alone.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There is a delightful air of exaggeration about the details of
Jonah's 
</P>
<P>experiences.  Ancient Nineveh (near Mosul in modern Iraq) was not
so large 
</P>
<P>as to take three days to walk across.  The Assyrian empire, of
course, was 
</P>
<P>much larger.  Although no accurate estimate has been made of the
date of 
</P>
<P>the writing of the book, it is believed to have been long after
the fall 
</P>
<P>of Assyria to the Babylonians (ca. 610 BCE) and the exile of the
6th 
</P>
<P>century BCE.  The exaggeration serves to heighten the threat to
Israel's 
</P>
<P>national existence in the same way that the exile did.  The storm
and the 
</P>
<P>fish that swallowed Jonah are symbolic of the exile and another 
</P>
<P>exaggeration of the prophet's experience.  He himself represents
those in 
</P>
<P>Israel who fear and hate their neighbors.  The ironic twist of the
story 
</P>
<P>comes in 3:10 when the God of Israel spared Israel's worst enemies
who 
</P>
<P>they repented after Jonah had preached to them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So &quot;what kind of a God is this?&quot; becomes the fundamental
issue of the 
</P>
<P>story.  The whole tenor of the narrative is that of a midrash, a
story 
</P>
<P>told to interpret biblical texts which raise similar questions. 
Three 
</P>
<P>such texts existed in the later prophetic literature: Exodus 34:6;
Numbers 
</P>
<P>23:19 and Ezekiel 18:23.  Is divine mercy more powerful than
justice? Can 
</P>
<P>a deity actually repent and change earlier decisions? Does
Yahweh's 
</P>
<P>preference to grant life rather than death extend beyond the
border of 
</P>
<P>Israel, the chosen people?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah represents the element in post-exilic Israel which turned
inward and 
</P>
<P>became extremely exclusivist, nationalistic and xenophobic.  This
attitude 
</P>
<P>contrasted with the universalism of Second Isaiah, but found also
in 
</P>
<P>Exodus 14:31; 1 Kings 19; Jeremiah 26 and 36; and Psalm 139. 
Prophetic 
</P>
<P>voices had always uttered judgment against Israel or other foreign
</P>
<P>nations.  Usually they had extended the hope of Yahweh's mercy for
those 
</P>
<P>Israelites who remained faithful or repented.  Generally speaking,
they 
</P>
<P>predicted the destruction of Israel's oppressors.  Like the Book
of Ruth, 
</P>
<P>Jonah widens the embrace of divine mercy to all peoples, even
those like 
</P>
<P>Assyria who had brutally oppressed Israel at different periods of
its 
</P>
<P>history.</P>
<P>                                        
</P>
<P>How can Christian gospel be proclaimed from this text? The Old
Testament 
</P>
<P>is our book too, not merely &quot;the Hebrew scriptures.&quot; The
compassionate God 
</P>
<P>of Jonah is still Lord of history.  Warring nation states on both
sides of 
</P>
<P>20th century conflicts sought to use this God as a means of
propaganda to 
</P>
<P>judge the conduct of their enemies.  Some claimants to Christian
faith 
</P>
<P>still hold to a belief in a violent outcome of a final Armageddon
in which 
</P>
<P>divine forces will aid in the victory over other &quot;evil
empires.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But does God not see the history of our times through the eyes of
Jesus 
</P>
<P>Christ? Are not the gifts of the Spirit enumerated in Galatians
5:22-23 
</P>
<P>the spiritual values that will determine the ultimate end of our
present 
</P>
<P>world struggles? If we were in the Ninevites position, would we
prefer the 
</P>
<P>end of the story Jonah predicted or the end as it is written?
Could not

Milton's 
</P>
<P>e-zine RUMORS (rumors@joinhands.com) be the moving spirit of our
times? It 
</P>
<P>seems to say what the Book of Jonah was also saying.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Ships sail east and ships sail west</P>
<P>While the self same breezes blow:</P>
<P>It's the set of the sails and not the gales</P>
<P>That determines the way they go.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Like the winds of the sea is the way of fate</P>
<P>As we journey along through life.</P>
<P>It's the set of the soul that determines the goal</P>

</P>
<P>PSALM 62:5-12   The only explanation for beginning the reading of
this 
</P>
<P>psalm at vs. 5 is that, according to scholars, it had become
corrupted in 
</P>
<P>some way during transmission; its original beginning lost and
replaced by 
</P>
<P>a repetition of vss. 5-6 as vss. 1-2.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The poem has some relationship with the vocabulary and mood of
Qoheleth</P>
<P>(Ecclesiastes) and the later Wisdom literature of the
Intertestamental 
</P>
<P>period.  This is especially noticeable in vs. 9.  At the same
time, it 
</P>
<P>also expresses a sincere confidence in God using traditional
phrases of 
</P>
<P>the Psalter such as &quot;my rock and my salvation&quot;; &quot;my
fortress&quot; and &quot;a 
</P>
<P>refuge&quot;.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The psalm goes well with the reading from Jonah because it
presents the 
</P>
<P>same elements of universal justice (vss. 9-10) and compassion
based on the 
</P>
<P>psalmist's confident trust in God's steadfast love (vss. 11-12).  
</P>

</P>
<P>1 CORINTHIANS 7:29-31   In this brief passage Paul appears to
counter the 
</P>
<P>traditional view of both Jewish and Christian family values by
promoting 
</P>
<P>celibacy within marriage as well as outside of it.  But is he
really 
</P>
<P>suggesting that marriage is not the best thing for young men and
women in 
</P>
<P>the Corinthian congregation? 
</P>
<P>  
</P>
<P>The key words are: &quot;...the appointed time has grown
short....&quot;  At this 
</P>
<P>stage in his ministry, Paul was looking for the imminent return of
Christ 
</P>
<P>in glory.  He wanted all faithful people to give themselves wholly
to 
</P>
<P>preparing for that event.  Marriage and family responsibilities
would 
</P>
<P>detract from their commitment.  So also would worldly possessions.
 It was 
</P>
<P>excessive attachment to these relationships, not their existence,
which 
</P>
<P>Paul decried.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Celibacy had received very little mention in the scriptures.  For
Jews it 
</P>
<P>was limited to those who through injury could not function
sexually (Deut.  
</P>
<P>23:1) and those who through a congenital condition, violence or
choice had 
</P>
<P>become eunuchs (Matt.  19:12).  As far as we know, Paul was not
married, 
</P>
<P>which was unusual for a rabbi; or his spouse had died, a not
uncommon 
</P>
<P>reality in those days of poor prenatal and postnatal health care. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Christian celibacy is thought to have derived from the Essene sect
of 
</P>
<P>Qumran.  Philo of Alexandria and Josephus both believed that the
Essenes 
</P>
<P>did not marry or practiced celibacy in marriage.  A closer
examination of 
</P>
<P>the cemetery at Qumran and of the Dead Sea Scrolls has revealed,
however, 
</P>
<P>that while marriage was restricted, it was by no means banned by
the sect.  
</P>
<P>The adoption of celibacy for clergy in the post-apostolic church
depended 
</P>
<P>more on dogmatic theological attitudes to sexuality by church
authorities 
</P>
<P>influenced by Neo-Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism.  As the
expectation 
</P>
<P>of the Parousia receded, celibacy was still praised and marriage 
</P>
<P>tolerated.  The triumph of the orthodox Trinitarian formula in the
4th 
</P>
<P>century increased the cult of the Virgin Mary and led to the
belief that 
</P>
<P>sexuality and marriage, while permitted, were less spiritually
valuable 
</P>
<P>than celibacy for both men and women.  However, this did not
become a 
</P>
<P>requirement for western clergy and religious vocations until the
12th 
</P>
<P>century.  It was never adopted by the Eastern Church and had not
been 
</P>
<P>effectively enforced in the Western Latin Church until the 19th
century.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>MARK 1:14-20   Mark's version of Jesus calling his first disciples
is 
</P>
<P>quite different from what we read in John 1:35-51.  John the
Baptist had 
</P>
<P>been imprisoned by Herod Antipas.  Jesus immediately took his
place 
</P>
<P>preaching repentance and the good news of God's salvation.  (1:14)
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The calling of the four fishermen occurred entirely on Jesus'
initiative, 
</P>
<P>not as John appears to say (John 1:35-51), due to of their
curiosity.  
</P>
<P>This was in keeping with Mark's presentation of Jesus' Messiahship
being 
</P>
<P>hidden until Peter's declaration toward the end of Jesus' ministry
(Mark 
</P>
<P>8:27-33).  However they were called, the disciples' response was 
</P>
<P>immediate.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Let's face it, this has always been a problem because the decision
of the 
</P>
<P>four fishermen seems so irrational.  The call of the four and
their 
</P>
<P>instantaneous response was intended, not to report an historical
event, 
</P>
<P>but to encourage faith and to set an example for others to follow.
 It has 
</P>
<P>succeeded remarkably in doing so, witness the frequency with which
the 
</P>
<P>story has been used in evangelical preaching and hymnody.  In
telling of 
</P>
<P>their call in this way, Mark appears to be saying that these
fishermen are 
</P>
<P>typical true believers, not church officials as the later
institution 
</P>
<P>regarded them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In a helpful article in *The Oxford Companion to the Bible*,
(Oxford 
</P>
<P>University Press, 1993. 138-9) Professor J. Andrew Overman, of the
</P>
<P>University of Rochester, NY, points out that for Mark the
disciples are 
</P>
<P>&quot;agents of instruction for the author, but as negative
examples.  They 
</P>
<P>teach the audience or readers, but mostly through the things they
do wrong 
</P>
<P>or fail to understand.&quot; This provides Mark with opportunities
to explain 
</P>
<P>Jesus' mission.  &quot;Discipleship in Mark involves fear, doubt
and 
</P>
<P>suffering....  (They) never fully understand and never quite
overcome 
</P>
<P>their fear and apprehension.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If this be so, then the immediate response of the four fishermen
was quite 
</P>
<P>uncharacteristic.  They did not hesitate at all when Jesus invited
them to 
</P>
<P>follow him and &quot;fish for people.&quot; But that is often the
case with 
</P>
<P>discipleship, isn't it? We begin with immediate enthusiastic
acceptance of 
</P>
<P>the invitation.  Subsequent experience knocks that out of us very
quickly.  
</P>
<P>The inspiration of the moment is easily stifled and a sense of
spiritual 
</P>
<P>boredom soon overwhelms us.  (Cf.  The parable of the sower and
seed - 
</P>
<P>Mark 4:3-9.) Compare also a modern instance, of all the thousands
who over 
</P>
<P>the past half century responded to Billy Graham's altar calls, how
many 
</P>
<P>have maintained their initial commitment? By introducing the four 
</P>
<P>disciples this early in his narrative, Mark is setting up just
such a 
</P>
<P>situation to teach his audience how difficult discipleship really
is when 
</P>
<P>lived out in the real world with only faith to carry them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Remember too, that Mark wrote in the 60s or early 70s CE when
Christian 
</P>
<P>discipleship had become exceedingly costly in Rome, for both Jews
and 
</P>
<P>Gentiles.  The gospel may well have been written soon after the
deaths of 
</P>
<P>both Peter and Paul during Emperor Nero's persecution.  He blamed
the 
</P>
<P>Christians for burning the city, a crime of which he himself was
guilty.  
</P>
<P>If Mark wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Jews
would also 
</P>
<P>have been in grave danger.  At such times who would have been
willing to 
</P>
<P>don the shoes of the four fishermen, humble Jews from Galilee?</P>

<P>Jonah 3:1-10; Psalm 62:5-12; Mark 1:14-20; I Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah 3:1-10.  This chapter is short (only ten verses) and its
message is simple and direct.  A chastened Jonah, having been rescued
from the belly of the fish, accepts the call earlier issued to him by
God and goes to Ninevah, &ldquo;an exceedingly large city&rdquo; to
proclaim the word of God to it.  His message is simple: &ldquo;Forty
days more, and Ninevah shall be overthrown&rdquo; (in Hebrew, that
message consists of only five words) (vs. 4).  The people and the
king hear Jonah&rsquo;s message, repent in sackcloth and ashes (vs.
8), and God spares them (vs. 10).  It&rsquo;s a simple story, but it
is a most profound understanding of the misuse of power and how God
can work to transform those seduced by such power.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To understand this story, one must first ask and answer the
question, &ldquo;What was Ninevah?&rdquo;  Ninevah was the capital
city of the Assyrian Empire, the dominant political and military
power in the Middle East from 880 to 620 BCE.  They conquered most of
the nations along the Fertile Crescent (including Israel) and
mercilessly harassed both the kingdoms of Judah and of Egypt.  They
were a warlike people, and their empire was built as a giant war
machine.  They were intolerant in religion, forcing each conquered
nation to worship their gods.  And they were well known for their
ruthless cruelty in warfare.  An example of the savagery of their
attack was stated by Ashur-nasir-pal II, one of their greatest
rulers, who wrote in the court records this description of his
conquering of one nation:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;I stormed the mountain peaks and took them.  In the midst
of the mighty mountain I slaughtered them, with their blood I dyed
the mountain red like wool.  With the rest of them I darkened the
gullies and precipices of the mountains.  I carried off their spoil
and their possessions.  The heads of their warriors I cut off, I
formed them into a pillar outside their city walls, I set the pillar
of heads afire, and then their young men and their maidens I burned
in that fire&rdquo;.[1]          
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Assyrians were particularly known for psychological warfare. 
When they would be ready to conquer a nation, their great army would
cover the hills and valleys around the capital city.  They would then
take the highest-ranking soldier of that nation whom they had
captured and would skin him alive in front of the city walls.  They
would hang the skin on a framework so that all on the walls could see
it, as the man, writhing in pain, died in front of his own flesh. 
The Assyrian commander would then give a challenge to the king.  He
had a choice.  Either he could surrender the city and the nation to
Assyria and his head would be quickly severed from his body.  Or, if
he chose to resist, then once the city fell to the Assyrian army,
that defending king would then be skinned alive in front of his
conquered people.[2]  When one reads the account written in II Kings
18:13 &ndash; 19:37 and Isaiah 36-37 of how the Rabshakeh (commanding
general) of the Assyrian army confronted Judah&rsquo;s king Hezekiah
in front of the city walls with the threat of the city&rsquo;s (and
Hezekiah&rsquo;s) annihilation and the clear implication that if he
did not surrender, Hezekiah would be skinned alive, one can much more
profoundly appreciate the degree of faith Hezekiah must have had in
God in order to accept the prophet Isaiah&rsquo;s counsel to trust in
God to deliver Israel from the Assyrians.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So Jonah preaches his five-word sermon, the Ninevites heed it and
repent (3:4-5).  When the Assyrian king hears Jonah&rsquo;s message,
he is so convicted that he decrees that the king and all his nobles,
as well as all the people, are to fast, pray, repent &ldquo;and turn
from (our) evil ways and from the violence that is in (our) hands&rdquo;
(3:6-8).  &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; the king says.  &ldquo;God may
relent and change his mind; he may turn from his fierce anger, so
that we do not perish&rdquo; (vs. 9).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>An intriguing parallel construction occurs at this point with the
king&rsquo;s command to his subjects and God&rsquo;s response to that
command.  It is as follows:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&middot;        &ldquo;All shall turn from their evil ways&rdquo;
(vs. 8)    &agrave;     &ldquo;God saw how they turned from their
evil ways&rdquo; (vs. 9)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&middot;        &ldquo;God may relent and change his mind&rdquo;
(9)    &agrave;     &ldquo;God changed his mind&rdquo; (10)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&middot;        &ldquo;So that we do not perish&rdquo; (9)    &agrave;
    &ldquo;and he did not do it&rdquo; (10).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So it was that what the Assyrian king purposed to do to bring his
nation to repentance, God honored and &ldquo;changed his mind&rdquo;
regarding their destruction.  Why did God honor the Assyrian
repentance?  There is an intriguing phrase in this story that reveals
why God responded the way he did.  The text says, &ldquo;When God saw
what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his
mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them,
and he did not do it&rdquo; (vs. 10). 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The narrator reports that &ldquo;God saw what they did&rdquo; in
that they &ldquo;turned from their evil ways&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;they
acted in good ways&rdquo;.  That is, the Assyrians not only repented
of their ruthlessness and cruelty.  They turned from it!  They
rejected it!  They put it behind themselves!  They didn&rsquo;t
simply try to do good acts to demonstrate that they had truly
repented.  They put their evil and ruthless ways behind themselves. 
That is, God &ldquo;saw&rdquo; an inner change of heart in the king,
nobles and people of Ninevah, a &ldquo;violent&rdquo; rejection of
their violence, and therefore God knew that their change in their
outward actions were not just a temporary veneer to make themselves
appear acceptable to God but a depth change of the very principles
and values upon which their society had previously acted (see also
Jer. 18:7-8; Exod. 32:12; I Sam. 7:8; II Sam. 24:16; Ezra 8:23; Ps.
90:13; Jer. 36:3,7).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalm 62 is a psalm of trust in God alone.  I find its refrain
particularly moving.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from
him.  He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not
be shaken.  On God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock;
my refuge is in God&rdquo; (Psalm 62:5-7, also see vss. 1-2).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The message throughout the entirety of this Psalm is God&rsquo;s
care of us and, consequently, the necessity for us to trust in him. 
&ldquo;Trust in him at all times, O people&rdquo;, the psalmist
declares.  &ldquo;Pour out your heart before him.  God is a refuge
for us&rdquo; (vs. 8).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And why?  Because neither we as individuals nor all of us as a
people or a nation are anything to depend upon.  We should not be so
foolish as to place confidence in ourselves or even in each other. 
So the Psalmist concludes, &ldquo;Once God has spoken; twice have I
heard this: that power belongs to God and steadfast love belongs to
you, O Lord.  For you repay to all, according to their work&rdquo;
(62:11-12). 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark 1:14-20 divides into two distinct sections.  Verses 14-15 are
an introduction to the first portion of the book of Mark.  Verses
16-20 tell of Jesus&rsquo; call to his first disciples.  Let&rsquo;s
consider each section.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee,
proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &ldquo;The time is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent and believe
in the good news&rdquo;.&rdquo;             (1:14-15)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This introductory passage tells us that Jesus began proclaiming
the kingdom of God &ldquo;after John was arrested&rdquo; (1:14). 
Thus, with his stepping into the void left by John&rsquo;s arrest,
Jesus is very intentionally taking on the mantle of John.  Yet, he is
&ldquo;more powerful than (John)&rdquo; (1:7), because he is God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Son, the Beloved&rdquo; (1:11), about whom John had
prophesied.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This passage is introductory material, but is distinct from the
introduction of Mark 1:1-11 that preceded it.  Whereas the earlier
introduction was of the entire book of Mark, this is an introduction
of the first section (1:14-10:52) only.  This section centers on
Jesus&rsquo; ministry, healings, teachings and controversies in
Galilee.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The text states that the essential ministry of Jesus was to
proclaim &ldquo;the good news of God&rdquo;.  This is an unusual
statement, the only time it appears in scripture.  Of course, the
word in Greek for &ldquo;good news&rdquo; is &ldquo;gospel&rdquo;, so
either word can be legitimately used here.  But the proclamation is
of the &ldquo;gospel of God&rdquo;, not of Jesus (cf. 1:1).  As we
pointed out in the exposition of Mark on the Second Sunday of Advent,
&ldquo;the word &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; was a technical term for &ldquo;news
of victory&rdquo;, (especially) for the ascension to power of a new
Roman emperor&rdquo;.  Thus, in Jesus&rsquo; proclamation of &ldquo;the
good news of God&rdquo;, he is proclaiming how God has and will act
to bring a new monarch &ndash; God&rsquo;s monarch -- to leadership
in the world.  And this, in turn, sets the theme for this entire
section (1:14&mdash;10:52).  God is acting mightily among humanity
(and especially among the poor and powerless) through the person of
Jesus of Nazareth.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jesus proclaims, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of
God has come near&rdquo; (or, equally possible in the Greek, &ldquo;is
at hand&rdquo;).  The words &ldquo;fulfilled&rdquo; and &ldquo;come
near&rdquo; or &ldquo;at hand&rdquo; are in the perfect tense.  The
perfect tense in Greek was always used to convey an action begun in
the past that is being carried on into the present and even beyond
the present into the future. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Thus, what Jesus is proclaiming in these words is that the Kingdom
of God didn&rsquo;t initiate with him.  The creation of the Kingdom
of God began with the very origins of Israel, when Abraham was called
out of Ur into the Promised Land and God made covenant with him to
bless all the nations of the world through him (Gen. 12:1-3).  The
nation was actualized through the actions of Moses that liberated the
Israelites from Egyptian oppression and formed them into God&rsquo;s
people in the wilderness.  The Kingdom of God was established through
the kings and given theological perspective through the prophets.  It
was contained in the dream of shalom and of Jubilee.  And now, with
Jesus assuming John&rsquo;s mantle and proclaiming &ldquo;the good
news of God&rdquo;, the Kingdom is now reaching its apex, its high
point, its denouement in Him! 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The coming of Jesus, Mark is announcing to the reader in 1:14-15,
has set into motion all the spiritual forces and the political and
economic incentives that will bring about the actualization of the
Kingdom of God.  Thus, after Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection and
ascension into heaven, the formation of that kingdom will continue
throughout church history until the end time.  This is now the divine
moment, the &ldquo;kairos&rdquo; moment for the kingdom when, with
the arrival of Jesus, the &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; now becomes &ldquo;gospel&rdquo;
for all the peoples of the whole world, and it becomes actualized in
the church!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But how is God&rsquo;s Kingdom actualized?  Jesus proclaimed,
&ldquo;Repent, and believe in the good news&rdquo; (1:15b).  To take
on the Kingdom in one&rsquo;s own life, in one&rsquo;s family and in
one&rsquo;s society requires both repentance and belief.  It requires
&ldquo;repentance&rdquo; of the way we have been seduced by the old
order, by a society that prizes control, oppression, exploitation,
greed, lust for power, dominance.  That was what John proclaimed
(1:4).  But Jesus goes farther.  It also requires &ldquo;belief in
the good news&rdquo;.  To embrace God&rsquo;s new order and to allow
it to reshape your life in entirety requires to &ldquo;believe in the
good news&rdquo;&rsquo; it requires &ldquo;faith&rdquo; (the same
Greek word, pistis, is either translated &ldquo;faith&rdquo; or
&ldquo;belief&rdquo;).  It requires a heart, mind, soul and body
commitment to the new order, an embracing of it not only in one&rsquo;s
own life but in all of one&rsquo;s efforts to work for the
transformation of human politics, economics, education and values
into the &ldquo;shalom community&rdquo;.  God requires repentance,
belief and obedience in response to this new &ldquo;good news&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark 1:16-20 is the telling of Jesus&rsquo; first call to
potential disciples to &ldquo;come, follow me&rdquo; (1:17).  The two
call stories of disciples that are presented here and the one that
follows in Mark 2:13-14 all follow exactly the same pattern.  That
pattern is that (1) Jesus moves along the shore, where the people are
gathered (1:16a, 19a, 2:13); (2) he meets people doing business and
engages them in conversation (1:16b, 19b, 2:13-14); (3) he calls
specific individuals among them to follow him (1:17, 20a; 2:14); and
(4) these people abandon their workplace and their profession, and
follow him (1:18, 20b; 2:14b).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the story of the challenge given to Simon (later called Peter)
and Andrew, Jesus&rsquo; call is of particular significance.  Noting
that they are fishermen, and making a play on words, Jesus says,
&ldquo;Follow me, and I will make you fish for people&rdquo; (or
better, in the Greek, &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;) (1:17).  It is
worth to thoughtfully examine this passage because this is one of the
most misinterpreted passages in scripture. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In this passage, Jesus is obviously calling these potential
disciples into a vocation.  But what is that vocation into which they
(and we) are being called?  Are they being called into an
evangelistic task?  Or does the term, &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;
have a far more profound meaning than that of winning people to faith
(pistis) in Christ?  To answer this question, we must do what we have
repeatedly done in our study of the lectionary.  We must ask the
question, &ldquo;What did the term, &lsquo;fishers of men&rsquo;,
mean to Jews living in the first century A.D.?&rdquo;  And to answer
that question, we must turn to the way this phrase or comparable
phrases were used in the Old Testament.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There are only three places in the Hebrew Bible in which this same
image was used.  Those passages are Jeremiah 16:16, Amos 4:2 and
Ezekiel 29:4.  In Jeremiah 16:16, it is used of Israel&rsquo;s
leaders being &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by God-appointed &ldquo;fishermen&rdquo;
and punished for their abuse of power, because of &ldquo;their
iniquity and their sin&rdquo; (16:18) where they &ldquo;have filled
my inheritance with their abominations&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In Amos 4:2, Israel&rsquo;s political, economic and religious
leaders and their wives will be taken away into captivity &ldquo;with
hooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;with fishhooks&rdquo;, the prophet declares,
because they both &ldquo;oppress the poor and crush the needy&rdquo;
and at the same time, live in conspicuous consumption in front of
those they oppress.  In Ezekiel 29:4, God will &ldquo;put hooks in
the jaws&rdquo; of Pharaoh king of Egypt and will &lsquo;draw you up
from your channels and fling you into the wilderness&rdquo; (vss.
4-5) &ldquo;because you were a staff of reed to the house of Israel;
when they grasped you with the hand, you broke, and when they leaned
on you, you made all their legs unsteady&rdquo; (vss. 6-7). 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In each of these three Old Testament uses of &ldquo;fishers of
men&rdquo;, judgment comes upon the powerful because they did not use
their power to eliminate poverty, to empower the people or to benefit
the common good.  In each usage, the powerful are criticized for not
using their power to move their society toward increasingly becoming
the Kingdom of God!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>But what does this have to do with these newly called disciples
and their vocation of being &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;?  In Mark
1:16-20 is a very intriguing phrase that tells us a great deal about
the economic condition of these men and their family businesses. 
Verse 20 states, &ldquo;James and John left their father Zebedee in
the boat with the hired men and followed Jesus&rdquo;.  With the
hired men!  The Zebedee Fishing Company had employees!  That was an
indication that the family of James and John was at least
economically &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;.  They belonged to an
independent artisan class of people.  They were not day laborers, the
peasants or the poor of Israel.  It is reasonable to assume that the
same would be true of Andrew and Simon.  If Levi (Matthew) was indeed
a tax collector (as implied in the third call in Mk. 2:14), he would
be economically &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; as well.  In fact, Jesus
was himself a carpenter, which would also make him an independent
artisan, possibly working with his father and brothers in the family
business.  And as we examine the other disciples, the same would be
true of them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jewish society during the lifetime of Jesus was essentially
divided into four levels.  Those at the top were the governing class
of Gentile and Jewish rulers and the Jerusalem Clergy Aristocracy. 
They made up, at most, 2% of the population.  With their retainers,
they would have been about 7% of the population.  Merchants and
artisans made up of the second level of society, ranging from highly
successful and well-to-do merchants to artisans whose skills made
them economically valuable.  They made up about 13% of the
population.  Below them were the peasants who worked the fields of
the merchants and landowners and who were employed in the shops of
the artisans; they made up about 70% of the population.  At the
bottom of society were the unclean and the expendables.  According to
the economic health of the nation at any moment, those at the bottom
could vary between 10% and 20% (when many peasants would fall into
the expendable category) of the population.[3]   
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jesus and his disciples were primarily made up of the &ldquo;artisan&rdquo;
class of people.  Not many of them were peasants and very, very few
would be among either the governing class or the expendables.  But
the ministry to which Jesus felt called was to the expendables and
the peasants of Israelite society!  Jesus saw his task as afflicting
the comfortable and comforting the afflicted.  Empowered by the
vision of the Kingdom of God &ndash; the shalom society of Jubilee
that God had intended all Israel (and indeed the entire world) to
live under &ndash; Jesus set about the task of calling the &ldquo;artisan&rdquo;
class to follow him in calling Israel back to the practice of a
society under God living in justice and equity for all.  Thus, Jesus
called his followers to be &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;!  As Ched
Myers so magnificently put it,</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;Following Jesus requires not just assent of the heart, but
a fundamental reordering of social-economic relationships.  The first
step in dismantling the dominant social order is to overturn the
&ldquo;world&rdquo; of the disciples: in the kingdom, the personal
and the political are one. . . . Thus, this is not a call &ldquo;out&rdquo;
of the world, but into an alternative social practice&rdquo;.[4]</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the Old Testament lesson for today, the Assyrians thoroughly,
totally and even &ldquo;violently&rdquo; repented of their national
sin, and thus were saved.  Well, it was this total, thorough,
&ldquo;violent&rdquo; response on the part of Israel&rsquo;s
political, economic and religious aristocracy for which Jesus was
calling.  And in the Gospel lesson for today, Jesus was calling his
fellow &ldquo;artisans&rdquo; to become united in using the influence
and power they had to convince Israel&rsquo;s leadership to embrace
the &ldquo;shalom&rdquo; society presented throughout the Old
Testament!  If heathen as evil as the Assyrians could repent, change
their ways and commit themselves to building a shalom world, then
Israel&rsquo;s leadership of the first century could do it as well. 
No nation should live with 2% dominating, controlling and exploiting
all the rest &ndash; but least of all, God&rsquo;s nation &ndash;
Israel.  They had been called to far more than that.  They had been
called to embrace God&rsquo;s intentions of shaping together a shalom
community of justice, equity, elimination of poverty and a vital
relationship with God.  Now, God was giving them this opportunity. 
Now, God was calling on them to repent and become that nation, under
God, that God always intended them to be.  Would the king, the
nobles, the people of Israel believe God, repent and turn from their
evil ways?  Would God see authentic repentance?  Or would their
actions force God to judge and destroy them and begin to search for a
new people? 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I Corinthians 7:29-31 declares, &ldquo;I mean, brothers and
sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even
those who have wives be as though they had none, and those who mourn
as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though
they had no possessions, and those who deal with the world as though
they had no dealing with it.  For the present form of this world is
passing away.&rdquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&ldquo;Time is short&rdquo;.  This is a phrase Paul used to
impress upon the Christians that the end of the age was near and that
they should therefore not be diverted from a highly intentional
living out of their call (e.g., 1:7-8; 3:13-15; 4:4-5; 5:5).  There
is much in life that is attractive &ndash; marriage, happiness,
possessions, even legitimate sorrow.  But all of these, and others as
well, can easily divert us from &ldquo;keeping on keeping on&rdquo;. 
We are not to give way to the values of society as corrupted by the
lust for power, greed and domination.  Jesus called potential
disciples to recognize that the dismantling of the dominant social
order and the reordering of society with Godly values must begin with
one&rsquo;s self, and one&rsquo;s own intentional choices.  We must
choose to live as followers of the Christ and the Christ-way of life,
seeking to help form the shalom community in a world given over to
injustice and unrighteousness.  We must live in the world but not be
of it.  For it is only in this way that we can truly become &ldquo;fishers
of men&rdquo;.</P>

<P>Reflection: 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>For many years, I led a weekly Bible study on Thursday evenings in
the church I was serving. Most weeks, we used the Seasons of the
Spirit curriculum to reflect on the readings for the following
Sunday, but once a year we spent the evening reading an entire Gospel
(the one for that church year), out loud, from beginning to end, with
everyone taking a turn. As much as I appreciate the lectionary, I
found that annual practice immensely helpful for hearing so much
that's missed if the Gospel is read in pieces that are more like
episodes in a series. The Gospel of Mark was a good one to begin
with, since it's shorter than the others, but it's particularly good
for a one-sitting reading, and I think that's because of its pace.
Read out loud, straight through, Mark's Gospel conveys a sense of the
urgency in the ministry of Jesus. (Also, more than once, our little
group actually laughed in surprise at the questions the clueless
disciples asked, given all they had seen and experienced, just a few
verses or chapters earlier. You miss that in the lectionary.)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Ted Smith captures the urgency well: &quot;Mark,&quot; he writes,
&quot;begins like an alarm clock, persistently declaring the time and
demanding some response&quot; (Feasting on the Word). The Gospel
takes off, without the beautiful infancy narratives, no manger, no
shepherds, no elderly prophets singing praise to God in the temple as
they hold the promised One, a baby, in their arms. Instead, Mark sets
the scene with compact accounts of John the Baptist preaching, and
Jesus being baptized and then driven into the wilderness (Mark gives
the wilderness temptations two verses, while Matthew uses fourteen).
At a clipped pace, the Gospel writer simply refers to John's arrest
so he can get on to his main point, the beginning of Jesus' public
ministry. Even at the end of today's reading, we're not even halfway
through chapter 1!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Time, then, and urgency are at the heart of this passage. In that
first chapter, William Abraham writes, &quot;Jesus sweeps through
Galilee and takes it by storm&hellip;.the underlying sense is that
God is on the march in the ministry of Jesus&quot; (The Lectionary
Commentary). The time is now, Jesus announces: his very first words
of proclamation are &quot;The time is fulfilled&quot; (v.15). Eugene
Peterson even translates it as &quot;Time's up!&quot; (The Message).
This isn't the kind of time we keep track of in our calendars and
journals: days, weeks, months and years. It's another kind of time,
found in the New Testament but sometimes experienced today, too:
kairos, as Fred Craddock describes it, &quot;a special time, an
opportune time, a time in which the constellation of factors creates
an unusually significant moment&quot; (Preaching through the
Christian Year B). It's the kind of time we long for, especially as
communities, and the people of Israel had been waiting for just such
a moment, when the heel of this oppressor or that one (there had been
so many, from Egypt through Assyria and Babylon to Rome) would be
removed from their throats. They trusted in the promises of God even
when everything around them contradicted and even violated the vision
of justice and peace, of shalom, that was at the heart of those
promises. The prophets spoke and sang of this hope, and how could the
people of God not hold onto it, long for it, watch for it? And yet,
how does one prepare for such a time? And how does one respond to it
when it finally comes?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Much has been written about the response of the disciples who
dropped everything to follow Jesus. Why did they do something so
drastic, and how could they up-end their lives so dramatically, and
would that really be a good thing for us to do, that is, if we could
&quot;manage&quot; it? We can't help putting ourselves in that boat,
or on that shore, doing our everyday work, casting our nets and
minding our own business, fulfilling our commitments and dealing with
the reality of having to work just to survive. Could we measure up to
the standard of those disciples, and drop everything, too? We might
wonder why and how those first four disciples could do such a thing,
without even a stirring sermon from Jesus, or maybe a dramatic
miracle, or better yet, the sky opening up and a voice announcing
that this was God's own beloved, and that they should listen to him
(we assume they weren't around when Jesus was baptized, just a few
verses earlier). Such an incident would have provided some clear
explanation for their abandonment of everything to follow Jesus. And
it's perplexing that men of such insight and response would then
prove to be those same clueless disciples through much of Mark's
Gospel. What did they know, on that seashore, that we don't know?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Barbara Brown Taylor suggests that we're missing the point if we
linger on such questions. This is a story about God, not the
disciples or us, she claims in her sermon, &quot;Miracle on the
Beach.&quot; To focus on what the disciples gave up (and whether we
could do the same), is &quot;to put the accent on the wrong
syllable.&quot; This &quot;miracle story,&quot; as she calls it, is
really about &quot;the power of God--to walk right up to a quartet of
fishermen and work a miracle, creating faith where there was no
faith, creating disciples where there were none just a moment
before.&quot; Now this way of approaching the story may, oddly, make
us uncomfortable, especially in a culture that emphasizes our choices
and independence, our ability to shape our lives and determine our
destinies. We can do it; it's within our power; we can fix and
improve everything; we can take hold of the future and make it what
we want it to be. In fact, we have to do it, in order to please God
and get to heaven. The better we are, the more saintly and
sacrificing we are, the more likely we are to earn our salvation.
Taylor rightly calls this &quot;works-righteousness&quot;: &quot;What
we may have lost along the way is a full sense of the power of God &ndash;
to recruit people who have made terrible choices; to invade the most
hapless lives and fill them with light; to sneak up on people who are
thinking about lunch, not God, and smack them upside the head with
glory&quot; (Home by Another Way).  Whether we're ready or not, God
acts.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And yet we do have the freedom to respond to God's grace and God's
call. Those are words we say often, but what does that response look
and feel like? Ted Smith helpfully suggests that Jesus doesn't ask
the fishermen &quot;to add one more task to their busy lives. He
calls them into new ways of being.&quot; So he doesn't give them a
new list of things to do but &quot;a new identity&hellip;.a whole new
life&quot; (Feasting on the Word). On the other hand, Elton W. Brown
acknowledges that our whole new life has a lot of work in it,
including the work we do for the sake of the kingdom: maybe the fun
part is throwing the nets out and bringing in the haul, but &quot;[t]here
are also the preparations, the mending of nets, repairing the tools
that are bound to be damaged and worn&hellip;.You can't always be
fishing, even if that's your favorite part&quot; (Feasting on the
Word).  We are caught (so to speak) once again in that tension
between works-righteousness and a conversion experience of grace that
really changes the way we behave. Barbara Brown Taylor suggests that,
like the disciples who turned in a new direction, we also turn our
lives &quot;in the same direction as God's life,&quot; and that
means, perhaps, doing the same things but doing them &quot;in a new
way, or for new reasons.&quot; What's important is that &quot;our
wills spill into the will of God,&quot; and then, &quot;time is
fulfilled--immediately!--and the kingdom is at hand&quot; (Home by
Another Way).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>What about &quot;the will of God&quot;? What about the need and
longing of the world, and the hope, and expectation, of the people?
And what is this &quot;kingdom&quot; that Jesus proclaims has drawn
near? William Abraham hears political content in Jesus' message, and
he offers us some hard words about it: our response shouldn't just
focus on &quot;looking within ourselves and discovering what we need,
what we have done wrong, or where we need comfort and consolation and
then turning to God to take care of our list of particulars.&quot; We
may want to concentrate on our own personal &quot;piety,&quot; but
&quot;kingdom discourse,&quot; he says, turns our attention, and our
energies, toward &quot;current public and political issues&quot; (The
Lectionary Commentary). 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Engaging, then, in &quot;kingdom discourse,&quot; we might
consider the significance not only of &quot;when&quot; in this
passage, but &quot;where&quot; it happens. Jesus didn't begin his
ministry by walking into the temple, the center of the religious life
of his people, or even into the city of Jerusalem, and announcing who
he was and what he was about. He started out on the edges, even when
he came out of the wilderness, preaching in places like Galilee, and
gathering his little band of disciples not from the religious leaders
and scholars but from fishermen, here and there, along the seashore,
the prosperous ones like James and John (with their boat and their
hired men), and the poorer ones like Simon and Andrew, who had to
cast their nets from the shore. Again, William Abraham writes that
Jesus began his ministry out there, away from &quot;the great centers
of power&quot; because &quot;the ground has to be further prepared
before he can speak directly to the powers that be&quot; (The
Lectionary Commentary). This week, we have observed a holiday that
reminds us of the great struggle of a people whose faith in God
sustained (and sustains) them through a long and hard experience of
oppression. The personal response of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and
of countless other individuals, expresses faith in what God has done
and continues to do and promises to do, and Jesus embodies that
promise and that &quot;kingdom,&quot; that new and decisive way to
live according to the will of God. In the United States, we have
collectively recommitted, in a moment in our own history of fresh
hope and possibility, to seek new occasions and new ways to walk in
the ways of justice, healing, and peace. Dr. King drew together that
public/political nature of the kingdom with our own call from God,
away from old ways of being, to claim our identity as the children of
God, and to live lives faithful to such a calling: &quot;Now,&quot;
he said, &quot;Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and
bitter--but beautiful--struggle for a new world. This is the calling
of the [children] of God, and our brothers [and sisters] wait eagerly
for our response&quot; (from &quot;A Time to Break Silence).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And so, whether we leave our nets for good, or return to them and
catch fish in a new way, with a new identity and a whole new life, we
are responding to Jesus, and to what God is doing in Jesus. This is
not just a moment of decision, but a lifelong commitment, and we have
something of immeasurable value to sustain us along the way, the
promise, as Henri Nouwen says, that &quot;the same Lord who binds us
together in love will also reveal himself to us and others as we walk
together on the road.&quot;  Christians are called to ministry, and
&quot;[t]he mystery of ministry is that we have been chosen to make
our own limited and very conditional love the gateway for the
unlimited and unconditional love of God&quot; (In the Name of Jesus).
This love permeates our lives, both public and personal, and reveals
God's own hand at work in our lives.</P>

<P>    What's Out in the Conversation</P>
<P>    A conversation about this week's lectionary Bible passages</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Psalm 62:5-12 reminds us that the &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo; is not
about finances or politics. The bottom line by which all things are
reckoned is God alone. When the psalmist poetically recalls that
&ldquo;Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that power
belongs to God&rdquo; (verse 11), we are challenged to remember that
even though God&rsquo;s word may appear as a one-time moment, we hear
it at different times and in different ways.</P>
<P>	</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>What difference would it make in your life if you were to wait for
God alone, if you were to put your confidence only in God?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah 3:1-5, 10 calls us to look, not at the prophet Jonah, but at
the exceedingly large city of Nineveh and at its surprising acts of
repentance. Yes, the political scene can change overnight. The change
is so abrupt, so dramatic. Nineveh&rsquo;s turning moment was
certainly unexpected by Jonah. This unexpected mercy will challenge
Jonah about his own need for radical conversion in the next chapter
of the story.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>What does it mean that God changes God&rsquo;s mind (verse 10)?
How easily we forget that human agency is so intertwined with our
perceptions of God&rsquo;s actions that the assertion that &ldquo;God
changed God&rsquo;s mind&rdquo; may be the best we can do to explain
God&rsquo;s acts that do not meet our expectations. We envision the
time when much of the church reports that &ldquo;God changed God&rsquo;s
mind&rdquo; about LGBT persons and non-heterosexual relationships,
pronouncing us blessed instead of cursed. Of course, some of us are
clear that such is the truth already. God&rsquo;s mind does not need
to change, only people&rsquo;s perceptions of God&rsquo;s mind.</P>
<P>	</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When, perhaps, has God&rsquo;s unexpected acts prompted you to
radical conversion or change?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1 Corinthians 7:29-31 speaks to how we as people of faith live in
a world that is changing. The answer: hold everything lightly. Don&rsquo;t
try to cling to what you think you have. Stay in the midst of your
emotions, your relationships, your business, without allowing those
things to define your life or expectations.</P>
<P>	</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>How would it change your priorities, actions and commitments if
you were to live as if God&rsquo;s realm was the coming reality
instead of basing your actions on the known world which is passing
away?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark 1:14-20 seems to call attention to the radical response of
Simon, Andrew, James and John when they hear Jesus&rsquo; call. Yet
we found ourselves asking what makes it possible for some to respond
immediately while for others the response is more difficult. What
kept father Zebedee and the hired workers from responding to the
call? The answer may not be as simple as believing that Jesus
extended the call only to those specific individuals.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Judith Hoch Wray comments that &ldquo;When I am tempted to believe
that God&rsquo;s call to me to be publicly out as a Christian lesbian
is a universal call, I am reminded of the power dynamics that make it
difficult, if not impossible, for some LGBT persons to respond to
that same call to be out.&rdquo; Not everyone responds at the same
time or in the same way. Each of us experience moments of being ready
to respond to transformation. Such moments are not always concurrent
with the call extended to us. What grace that the call does not go
away! God&rsquo;s invitation comes back again and again until we are
truly ready to respond (compare with Jonah 3:1 &ldquo;a second
time&rdquo;).</P>
<P>	</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>How do our responsibilities and our power in the community either
inhibit us or allow us to respond to the call of God? How do we
respect and challenge each other&rsquo;s responses without judging
another&rsquo;s faithfulness to God&rsquo;s call?</P>

<P>What a wretched, miserable specimen of humanity Jonah is! Here is
a man who makes Eeyore look as if he&rsquo;s overdosing on Prozak.
Having completely blown his first call to preach to the people of
Nineveh he is given a second chance to redeem himself and so goes to
preach to this great, sprawling city. And what a place Nineveh was.
Referred to elsewhere in the Old Testament as a place of endless
cruelty, a city of blood, this is one city ripe for judgement and
destruction. It was the day of reckoning for Nineveh and Jonah is
called to proclaim it. He is the herald of doom. So Jonah the
reluctant prophet sets off, finds a convenient pulpit a day&rsquo;s
journey into the city, and proclaims his gloomy message to the
people. And much to Jonah&rsquo;s irritation, God lets him down.
People actually listen to what Jonah has to say. Revival breaks out
and, as Jonah feared, repentance follows and God decides not to
destroy the city after all. God notes the reaction to Jonah&rsquo;s
preaching, has a change of heart and gives them a reprieve. And what
a total twit Jonah feels. He feels undermined by God and resentful
and in the verses that follow he goes off in one humungous huff.
Having proclaimed destruction, he wants to see it happen!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jonah&rsquo;s attitude of course is reprehensible. He should have
been delighted that God had a change of mind. Jonah is a
hard-hearted, hard-boiled prig, but we have to say one thing about
Jonah: he understood the power of God&rsquo;s Word. He knew that when
it was unleashed the Word of God was likely to have this kind of
dramatic effect. He knew that it was likely to cut to the quick and
that it could provoke mass repentance. And that was just what he was
afraid of. That&rsquo;s why he ducked out of God&rsquo;s call first
time round. And indeed this is something that this passage seems to
be straining to tell us: the power of the Word of God. Jonah has only
to utter and suddenly repentance is rippling through the city and
soon high and low are donning sackcloth. Indeed so determined is this
text to convey to us the power of the Word of God that it even has
animals being affected! Yes, verse 8 states that &lsquo;every person
and every animal is to be covered with sackcloth&rsquo; and we can
only imagine some entrepreneurial wise-guy out in the city centre
flogging sackcloth for dogs, cats, guinea pigs, gerbils&hellip; &lsquo;buy
one, get one free!&rsquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And when we turn to Mark&rsquo;s Gospel we find the power of the
Word of God  is still palpable. John the Baptist has been arrested
and suddenly Jesus is on the scene and he&rsquo;s preaching,
proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. The Word of God is
sounding forth: &lsquo;the time has arrived: the kingdom of God is
upon you. Repent and believe the Gospel!&rsquo; And Mark employs a
different strategy for conveying the power of God&rsquo;s Word. Not
for him camels running around in sackcloth. He highlights instead the
radical effect of the Word of God: the disciples just drop everything
and follow. In Mark&rsquo;s Gospel there is no suggestion that these
disciples had ever seen or met Jesus before. There is no
getting-to-know-you. Suddenly Jesus just appears and proclaims and
the disciples leave their homes and their loved ones and these
fishermen drop everything. They leave their occupations and their
livelihoods and their security - and follow. They ask no questions,
there is no hesitation, just that familiar phrase that Mark uses
again and again in his Gospel: &lsquo;at once&hellip;&rsquo; Jesus
utters to Simon and Andrew and at once they leave their nets and
follow him. At once James and John are off, leaving a presumably
bemused Zebedee in the boat. It&rsquo;s that way when we encounter
God&rsquo;s Word in its full power and authority. And of course the
result is that transformation follows. Things change. Nineveh is
changed. Simon and Andrew and James and John will never be the same.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I want to probe this a bit further. I want to ponder more deeply
this extraordinary transforming power of the Word. What is it about
God&rsquo;s Word that gives it this power? How can it change things
so dramatically? At one level the answer to that is easy. After all,
God is speaking. It is God&rsquo;s Word and we should expect it to be
powerful and transforming. God spoke and the universe came into
being. By God&rsquo;s Word the heavens and earth were created. We
should expect it to be powerful, even when mediated through a human
mouth and tongue. But maybe there&rsquo;s more&hellip;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Let&rsquo;s turn for a moment to our third reading, this
extraordinary passage from Paul&rsquo;s first letter to the
Corinthians. Just listen again: &lsquo;What I mean my friends is
this. The time we live in will not last long: while it lasts married
men should be as if they had no wives; mourners should be as if they
had nothing to grieve them; the joyful as if they did not rejoice&hellip;&rsquo;
etc. etc. What is Paul on about here? Well, you see, Paul&rsquo;s
basic, fundamental conviction is that since Jesus has come something
utterly decisive has happened. To be more specific, Paul&rsquo;s
basic conviction is that because of Jesus the way things are now is
not the way things are going to be. With Jesus comes the promise of a
new world, a new creation, a new order where things will be changed.
And this is not just pie in the sky. It is already beginning now. The
new order is breaking in. But that means that here and now we are set
free to imagine the world differently - indeed not only to imagine
the world differently but to live differently. We are no linger
limited, no longer restricted, no longer bound by the way things are.
We are set free to imagine and to live now according to how things
will be. In Paul&rsquo;s terms, we are set free to live &lsquo;as if&lsquo;
- as if that new world is already here. And this is crucial. Things
do not need to be as they are.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Think about this. Christian feathers have been ruffled recently by
Richard Dawkins, that charismatic evangelical atheist with his
arguments against God and religion. We should not dismiss Dawkins
lightly. God needs to be put in the dock from, time to time. But one
problem with Dawkins&rsquo; gospel of atheism is that we are left
only with evolution - and how Dawkins loves evolution! He loves the
way the universe has been fashioned and formed over billions of years
in evolution&rsquo;s steady ascent. And there is indeed something
astounding about all that. But the trouble, surely, with evolution by
itself is that there is a terrible necessity about the way things
are. The world as it is has been moulded and shaped over this vast
expanse of time and whatever has endured has done so because it has
adapted successfully. But that makes it very different to imagine how
things could be otherwise, how they could be different. Whatever has
endured has endured for a reason. Other options have been screened
out by natural selection. And we are therefore trapped by the immense
weight of the past. We are captive to the billions of years of
processes that have made us what we are. We are indeed creatures in
hock to the past.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Whereas for Paul, we are creatures of the future: freed from the
past, beckoned by the pull of a new creation to which we are being
drawn. And we are set free to imagine things that have not yet come
into being, and to live as if they have. Everything is being shaken
up and things lose their inevitability. So Paul says in effect:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&lsquo;Are you married? Well that&rsquo;s great! But now it&rsquo;s
all change. There is a new world overtaking this old one where there
wont be any marriage so you had better start living now as if you are
not married!&rsquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Or,</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&lsquo;Are you mourning? Well, I&rsquo;ve got news for you! It&rsquo;s
all change and a new world is coming where those who have sown in
tears will reap in joy. So live now as if...&rsquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Or,</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&lsquo;Are you rejoicing? Well, enjoy it while you can because
it&rsquo;s all change, and in the new reality those who are living on
a full tank of laughter are going to be running on empty. So live 
now as if&hellip;&lsquo;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And so on&hellip; Suddenly the world is being re-imagined,
re-envisioned, reframed. And so it is being changed. And maybe that
accounts for the power of the Word at Nineveh, and by the Sea of
Galilee. The people of that sordid city of Ninevah could suddenly
imagine that things could be different. There were new possibilities
for life with Jonah&rsquo;s God, so they repented. And similarly with
those fishermen, with their mundane existence and all the indignities
and injustices of their harsh lives under Roman rule. Maybe the
proclamation of Jesus that God&rsquo;s rule was breaking in opened
their minds to imagine life differently, to glimpse life as if. And
so they left their nets and they followed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Monday of  last week, January 19th, in the United States of
America, was a public holiday because it is Martin Luther King Day,
when Americans remember that great dreamer[1]. That is what was so
powerful about King. Steeped as he was in the Word of God he was set
free to dream, to imagine the world as if it were different. And he
was gifted with the language to articulate that dream -and just look
at its power! Look at the transformation it brought! And the
inauguration of the first black president of the United States, also
last  week, is testimony to that power. It&rsquo;s the same power
that broke out in Ninevah. It&rsquo;s the same power that left empty
boats and abandoned nets strewn on a Galilean lakeside.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This is what is gifted to us: the good news of the Kingdom, the
new world, the new order of things. And with it the gift of imagining
things differently, as if. Just see what transformation that can
bring.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Amen.</P>

</P>
<P>It is hard to sleep when you are hungry, when you know that you
have hit the end, when you cannot sink any lower, when you are doing
things that make you ashamed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This is where I was. I couldn't sleep because I knew that if I
continued what I was doing, I would die.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>During many long, agonizing nights, I would begin to remember.
There was one memory I could not shake. It was the moment when I went
to my father and demanded my inheritance. I knew and he knew what I
was saying: &quot;Old man, you are as good as dead to me.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Why did I deliberately hurt this man who had loved me every moment
of my life? My desire for freedom and excitement drove me. His love
made me feel cramped and I resented his hopes for my life.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>For a while I consumed everything that my heart and body desired.
Looking back, I can see that I had become ever more frenzied as the
thrills delivered ever diminishing returns.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I was so involved with indulging myself that I paid no attention
to the money running out. And it did. With my pockets empty, my
friends proved to be fickle and my lovers false.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There was nothing for me to do but to go to work. Now I knew work,
even hard work, but I had never been forced to do work that demeaned
and broke you. It was the only work I could find-feeding the pigs.
But then maybe it was appropriate for the pig to feed the pigs.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>It now sounds silly to say this, but my pride kept me at this work
for a long time. I kept thinking, &quot;I will get a break. This
can't be my life. There must be a way out.&quot; But things only got
worse, until one night when it seemed like the fog cleared. For the
first time in months, maybe years, I felt like I had come back to
myself.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So I left the pig farm and began the long walk to my father's
house. I didn't expect him to receive me as a son -- that
relationship was over -- but I knew that I would be better off as his
slave than in that pigpen.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I will never forget the moment when I saw my Father in the field.
Seeing him, I knew that he had been waiting for me, and I could
almost feel his eyes drawing me back home. When he recognized me, he
threw down his tools and began running down the road. As we came near
to each other, I fell at his feet and begged to become his slave, but
he greeted me as a beloved son. I groveled as the wastrel, the
scoundrel, the whoremonger that I was, but he brushed off all of my
words with his tears and kisses.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He called all the servants together. As they gathered, I could
tell that they were not pleased to see me. They respected my Father,
and they knew that I had broken his heart.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>My Father, though, immediately cut through the tension in the air
with these words: &quot;...this son of mine was dead and is alive
again; he was lost and is found!&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Even though they were cleaning me up and starting the fires for
the fatted calf, I couldn't relax. You see, I knew that I still had
to face my older brother. Things had never been good between us. He
had always been the good and responsible one, and I, well, you know
what I had been.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He came. He saw me. He sneered at the ring on my finger and the
robe around my shoulders. He curled his lips in disdain and said to
our Father that &quot;son of yours&quot; doesn't deserve any of this.
Looking at my Father, I saw that my brother's words hurt him just as
deeply as my words asking for my inheritance.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I am now reporting to you events that happened many years ago.
There has been some talk, especially among the young and restless,
about all the carousing that I had once done. Some of the stories
have a kernel of truth, but most have been embellished for the
titillation of the audience. I have even heard some people refer to
me as the prodigal son, but that is to miss the point of the story.
Do you want to know the true prodigal? It was my father. The story is
about his lavish, extravagant, and prodigal love.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Some people have questioned my father. Just what was he thinking
when he gave me the inheritance? Just what was he thinking when he
welcomed me back? This is just too easy. You can't just give love
away like that, they say. Some of these people are not parents, which
means that they do not know about the intricate and delicate dance a
parent has with a child around freedom. Some of these people just
don't know much about love, do they?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Some people think that my brother was treated unfairly. Some may
identify with him and his dutiful and responsible ways, and some of
them resent people like me. Some of these people have forgotten that
my Father loved him just as much as he loved me.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I now see that neither of us understood my father and his love. I
had thought that I could destroy it, and my brother had thought that
he needed to earn it.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Why do I stand before you and tell this story? Maybe there is
someone here who is now experiencing his or her own sleepless and
desperate nights. Maybe there is someone here who needs to come back
to himself, to herself. Maybe there is someone here who needs to come
back to God. If so, don't hesitate. God not only waits for you, he
sent his only son on a rescue mission from heaven to find you. If my
wonderful, though human and fallible, father could love so freely and
completely, just think how prodigal God's love and mercy must be.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And then maybe there is someone here who is like my brother. He
was a good fellow, he meant well, but his feeling that the weight of
the world was on his shoulders had pinched his heart. Do any of you
feel that way? It is not a good way to feel. If anyone here
identifies with him, would you please believe that you are loved and
that all that the father has is already yours?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>My father threw that feast for me when I returned home. That is
what parents do. Today God, our father, throws this feast. The feast
of Jesus. Please don't come thinking that you need to earn your way
here either with your remorse or your righteousness. Just come. Come
and acknowledge your hunger for God. Come and be filled. There is
enough for all. There is room for all. The father delights to see his
children feast together.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Let us pray.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Good and gracious God, help us to come to ourselves. Help us to
return to your love. Help us to see your great tenderness coming
towards us. Help us to know that you have already fitted us for the
robe and for the ring, and help us to smell the fatted calf of your
great forgiveness for us. Lord God, help each person who hears this
story see himself or herself in it and know that it is always
possible to return home to your great love for us. All this we ask in
your name and through the mercy and love of your Son Jesus. Amen.</P>

<P>THIRD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME &mdash; Year B (68)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;COME, FOLLOW ME&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Gospel: Mark 1:14-20</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Mark&rsquo;s version of the call of the first disciples repeats
the essentials of last week&rsquo;s reading, but carries a very
different emphasis than John&rsquo;s version. Jesus&rsquo; continuity
with John the Baptist is portrayed by his preaching the same message.
The first disciples in Mark&rsquo;s account were engaged in their
worldly occupation; they are not seen as already disciples of the
Baptist. John&rsquo;s Gospel gives us a hint of the process of
inquiry and call, whereas in Mark the call of Jesus comes suddenly
and without preparation. It is obviously a call charged with power:
they will share power as &quot;fishers of men&quot; and they respond
without hesitation. Divine power is emphasized in Mark&rsquo;s
telling; John&rsquo;s Gospel emphasizes God at work in the human
process of seeking and drawing close to Jesus as the source of life.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jesus is recognized as a rabbi (= teacher or master, see vv
21-22), but his style is not that of the seated learned man with a
crowd of students at his feet. He wanders from place to place,
pointing out the reality of life and the signs of his new life to his
disciples who keep up with him, and to the crowds that gather around
him.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>First Reading: Jonah 3:1-5, 10</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>God&rsquo;s power surpasses our expectations in unexpected &mdash;
and sometimes unwelcome &mdash; ways. Jonah went to Ninevah to
proclaim God&rsquo;s vengeance and destruction upon a sinful pagan
people. He suspected that God would be merciful, so he tried to run
away. But God had some rather striking ways of getting him back to
business. When the suspected but unwanted results actually do occur &mdash;
the repentance and saving of the people &mdash; Jonah becomes
disgruntled. But God gives him a lesson in humility and mercy. Read
the whole story.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Please note that this is a rather humorous &mdash; do we need to
be told? &mdash;and purely fictional story intended to broaden the
Israelites&rsquo; concept of God&rsquo;s love. It was written around
the fifth century B.C.E., when the remnant who returned from exile in
Babylon were struggling to make sense of their identity as God&rsquo;s
people in the face of defeat and oppression. Searching for remains of
a fish that could transport Jonah without digesting him, or trying to
justify it as a miracle, would be a useless exercise in religious
trivia and would only distract from the deeper meaning.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Responsorial Psalm: Psalm 25:4-5, 6-7, 8-9</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This psalm is a somewhat rambling meditation on God&rsquo;s
goodness, which he shows by mercy and forgiveness, and well as by
leading us to an every-deepening understanding of his ways. Response:
&quot;Teach me your ways, O Lord.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Second Reading: 1 Corinthians 7:29-31</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Beginning with chapter 7, Paul responds to specific questions that
were brought to him by messengers from the community. His lengthy
advice on marriage in this chapter is largely a plea for moderation
in the face of wildly diverse attitudes toward marriage, virginity,
and sexuality. Some members of the Corinthian Church apparently
tolerated extreme licentiousness while others held very strict views
on celibacy and disdained marriage altogether.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s specific advice in this passage centers on the use of
time. Time is always short, and we must order our activities in view
of the eternal kingdom of God. Paul&rsquo;s words are rooted in the
expectation that Christ would return soon, but they apply equally
today when we are conscious of the urgency of realizing Christ&rsquo;s
presence and fulfilling his will.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Questions for thought, discussion, and prayer:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>1. God wills the conversion of sinners, not their death. How do
you feel about people who sin against you?</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>2. Can even &quot;religious activities&quot; be a sort of &quot;worldly
occupation&quot; that Christ might call us away from?</P>
