John the Baptist is a model for preachers and witnesses today. In this reading 
from the Gospel of John, he points toward the One who is salvation rather than 
drawing attention to himself. He even watched two of his own disciples leave him 
and follow Jesus. How easy is it for us as disciples to lose sight of the true 
center and focus of our ministry, Jesus? How easy is it for &#8220;it&#8221; to become &#8220;all 
about us&#8221;? (Or all about the building, or all about the program, etc.?) What losses 
are we willing to suffer for the sake of the gospel? How willing are we to forego 
recognition and popularity when we so easily enjoy both in the life of the church? 
<br>
<br>
When John says more than once that he did not himself know Jesus, does it remind 
you of times that you have missed Jesus, missed God, missed the point? How did 
revelation come to you? To your congregation? <i><b><br>
<br>
God is still speaking theme:</b></i> The United Church of Christ has deepened 
its commitment to evangelism and strengthened its outreach to those beyond its 
walls by proclaiming with passionate conviction that <i><b>God is still speaking,</b></i> 
that &#8220;No matter who you are or where you are on life&#8217;s journey, you are welcome 
in this United Church of Christ congregation.&#8221; How do we hear the words of Jesus, 
&#8220;Come and see,&#8221; when we think of those who are seeking a church home? How comfortable 
are we with inviting those who ask us questions about our church to come and visit? 
If they do visit, what will they &#8220;come and see&#8221;? John&#8217;s two disciples were clearly 
seekers. How do we respond to the persistence and enthusiasm &#8211; or pain &#8211; of those 
who are seeking a new church home? <br>
<br>
How would you feel if you were Simon and your brother came to &#8220;drag&#8221; you to hear 
this new preacher? How would you then feel if this preacher/prophet/healer gave 
you a new name? What do you think God would be saying to you? Do you feel that 
you have been given a new name as a Christian and a disciple? Does it affect your 
life? When have you been invited, or the people in your church been invited, to 
come and see what is happening somewhere? What did you find? How many of the people 
in your church are there because someone invited them to come and see? <br>
<br>
In these Epiphany texts, the identity of Jesus as God&#8217;s revelation is emphasized. 
What kind of God does this Jesus reveal? What is he about? How &#8220;accessible&#8221; is 
this God? <br>
<br>
Speaking of this still-speaking God, what does the Isaiah text say that may challenge 
and even scandalize many church-goers today? Are we limited in our vision when 
we think of how God wants us to be in mission? Do we ourselves limit God&#8217;s mission 
(which we are about) to our own families, friends, congregation, neighbors&#8230;and 
folks we feel comfortable with? Who are those children of God &#8211; &#8220;the nations&#8221; 
that are beyond our borders, not just geographically but socially and psychologically, 
those we haven&#8217;t included in our plans? <br>
<br>
Brueggemann, et al., in Texts for Preaching: A Lectionary Commentary Based on 
the NRSV, Year A, speaks of the enlarged vision of God&#8217;s concern for humanity: 
&#8220;This is one of the most crucial texts in showing how the Old Testament breaks 
ethnic limitation and witnesses to the largeness of God&#8217;s rescue.&#8221; The commentator 
then compares the prophet/servant to Martin Luther King, Jr. (a timely comparison), 
whose vision of justice for people of color in the United States expanded dramatically 
to include issues of peace and economic justice. &#8220;He [MLK, Jr.] knew that the 
question of rights is a humanity-embracing question. This poet in our passage 
already knows that God&#8217;s powerful will for homecoming has no ethnic limitation.&#8221; 
<br>
<br>
Who, then, are the &#8220;nations&#8221; to whom we need to open our arms, and whom do we 
need to embrace in our vision of community? Whom would we prefer to exclude, or 
whom do we unconsciously exclude? &#8220;I myself did not know him.&#8221; What are we missing, 
and what revelation should we be praying for? In what ways are we &#8220;a light to 
the nations&#8221;? Are we willing to serve and welcome and reach out even to those 
who will never become members of our own community of faith, but need our presence 
in their lives, who need our support, our prayers, and our active pursuit of justice?

so often recited, but Martin Luther King, Jr., was a revolutionary. No, he wasn&#8217;t 
a revolutionary who favored armed struggle or overthrowing governments, but he 
was a revolutionary all the same. He was a revolutionary who called for a radical 
re-thinking of our values: We must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented 
society to a person-oriented society. This radical revolution of values would, 
Martin believed, lead us to a new vision and a new way of being &#8211;the Beloved Community. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The Beloved Community would be based upon love: When I speak of love...I am 
speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme 
unifying principle of life. Love is...the key that unlocks the door which leads 
to ultimate reality....We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow 
before the altar of retaliation. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The Beloved Community is based upon peace: Mankind must put an end to war 
or war will put an end to mankind...it is no longer a choice between violence 
and non-violence. It is either non-violence or non-existence. The Beloved Community 
is based upon justice: ...if our nation can spend $35 million a year to fight 
an unjust war...$20 billion to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions to 
put God&#8217;s children on our own two feet right here on earth....

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->
</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one 
psalm at each Sunday service, in this order: 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister 
of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant 
churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson 
from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2"> During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative 
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
