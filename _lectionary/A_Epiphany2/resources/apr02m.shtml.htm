<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<strong>Isaiah 49:1-7</strong>
<p>This is the second Servant Song. The servant speaks to Israelites
scattered around the Mediterranean (&#8220;coastlands&#8221;); he identifies
himself as chosen before he was born (like Jeremiah, Paul and John the
Baptist) and even named (like Jesus). Further, God made him an
effective instrument in proclaiming his message (&#8220;sharp sword&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). Perhaps God hid him for 
protection or in preparation for his mission. V. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>
may tell us who the servant is: &#8220;Israel&#8221;, the community of the
faithful, led by the prophet. They will show God&#8217;s power to others
(&#8220;glorified&#8221;). But the servant retorts (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>):
despite all our/my efforts, no one listens! Surely I minister on God&#8217;s
behalf and God will &#8220;reward&#8221; me for it (even if people don&#8217;t). The
servant&#8217;s &#8220;strength&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>)
is from God; he is to turn &#8220;Jacob&#8221; (Israel) back to God. God (not the
prophet) will gather &#8220;Israel&#8221; to him. But his mission is to all
peoples, not only wayward Israelites and the faithful (&#8220;survivors&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). God continues to speak to the 
servant, &#8220;one deeply despised&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>), hated by many and &#8220;the 
slave of rulers&#8221;: God&#8217;s fidelity is his surety that all, even rulers, will hold him in awe.</p>
<p>At the first level, in vv.

return from Babylon; this is the servant&#8217;s mission (&#8220;you&#8221;, v.

(&#8220;not hunger or thirst ...&#8221;, vv.

known world. God gave them a &#8220;covenant&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>) at Sinai; perhaps the servant is 
the new covenant &#8211; God will make a new covenant with his people. But note also &#8220;a time of favour&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+49%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>) and &#8220;a day of 
salvation&#8221;: these terms speak of the end times. God saves both now and in the era to come.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>1 Corinthians</b> 
</small><p>
<small>Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<hr>
<strong>1 Corinthians 1:1-9</strong>
<p>Paul uses the schema of Greek letters of the time, expanding it to
include specifically Christian notions. He is an &#8220;apostle&#8221;, one sent
out by Christ to perform a special mission. (&#8220;Sosthenes&#8221; may be the
&#8220;official of the synagogue&#8221; beaten in Acts <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+18%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18:17</a>.) The church at Corinth is 
made up of ordinary people &#8220;called to be saints&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>), set apart for God&#8217;s 
work in the world, &#8220;sanctified&#8221; in baptism. Perhaps Paul reminds them that there are Christians elsewhere too. V. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>
is his greeting: he wishes them &#8220;grace&#8221; (God&#8217;s freely given gift of
love) and &#8220;peace&#8221; (the total state of well-being to which we are
admitted through Christ): both come from the Father (as source) and the
Son (as means or agent). In later chapters, Paul cautions his readers
against misuse of <em>spiritual gifts</em> (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>), so in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>
he may be damning them with faint praise. He praises their eloquence
(&#8220;speech&#8221;) and understanding (&#8220;knowledge&#8221;) but not (as in other
letters) their faith, hope and love for each other and for Christ. In
v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>, &#8220;testimony&#8221; is 
<em>bearing witness</em>: God has strengthened them through their telling of the good news. They are indeed richly blessed (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>),
but (as mentioned later), they tend to dwell on the excitement of the
present rather than looking forward to &#8220;the revealing of ... Christ&#8221;,
his second coming. God will help them prepare for that day, so that
they may be among those judged worthy of eternal life (&#8220;blameless&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). &#8220;God is 
faithful&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Corinthians+1%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>): he 
will not abandon what he has begun. He has called them into &#8220;fellowship&#8221;, union with other believers which is union with Christ.</p>

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<hr>
<strong>John 1:29-42</strong>
<p>John the Baptist has denied that he is any of the figures expected
by Jews to inaugurate a new era: he is neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor
the prophet like Moses; rather he prepares people for the coming of the
Lord. He has also told some religious authorities that one is already
among them who is far more worthy than he.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day&#8221; John acclaims Jesus as &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221;. He is probably
thinking of the fourth Servant Song: there the servant is &#8220;like a lamb
that is led to the slaughter&#8221;. John recognizes that Jesus outranks him
(&#8220;ranks ahead&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">30</a>) 
and &#8220;was&#8221; (existed) before him. In vv.

he recalls his experience of Jesus&#8217; baptism, justifies for what he has
proclaimed. He says: I didn&#8217;t recognize him as Messiah (&#8220;know him&#8221;),
but I now realize that I baptised with water in order that Jesus might
be shown to Jews. The coming of the Spirit showed me that Jesus is the
one chosen by God. I am convinced that he is, and I have told others
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A34" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">34</a>). (Later on, on the lips of 
Martha, &#8220;Son of God&#8221; and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; are synonymous.)</p>

two of John&#8217;s disciples begin to follow Jesus. First, they are curious
about Jesus when John tells them who he is. They follow him,
recognizing that he is an authority (&#8220;Teacher&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>). Jesus invites them to 
&#8220;Come and see&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>),
to investigate what he teaches. &#8220;Staying&#8221; and &#8220;remained&#8221; are technical
terms in this gospel: the two begin to understand the way of life Jesus
offers and expects. V. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+1%3A40" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">40</a> tells us that one of the two is

to Jesus. (The Greek word translated &#8220;Anointed&#8221; is <em>Christos</em>.) Jesus prophesies that Simon will be nicknamed &#8220;Cephas&#8221; (v.

<em>rock</em>. <em>Petros</em>, the Greek word for &#8220;Peter&#8221;, also means <em>rock</em>.</p>
