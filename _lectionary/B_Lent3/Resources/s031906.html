<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Exodus 20:1-17

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Living in God's Promise

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt...”

<P>Questions:
<BR> It’s common to hear the words, “It’s all about relationship,” whether we’re talking about repeat customers or the trust we have in political leaders or how well we get along in our families.  Our endeavors, we say, will be more successful if we tend to our relationships, and yet those same relationships, if we’re not careful, can easily slip into being merely means to an end. Our readings in Lent have followed a path of covenant, of relationship with God, and God’s care in shaping that relationship, including the gift of these “commands” in Exodus, here at the foot of the mountain.  We may think there are many “laws” from God in the Hebrew Scripture, but we are told by scholars that this is the last time God speaks commands to the people; they are so frightened that they ask for Moses as an intermediary from then on.  Walter Brueggemann’s powerful writing on this passage places it at the heart of the exodus narrative, as it gives the people a sense of who they are because of what God has done for them, and continues to do for and with them. Rather than being a short list of legalistic prohibitions and requirements, the commands give shape and expression to the people’s relationship with the God who brought them out of slavery and away from Pharaoh’s oppressive system.  They speak of God’s holiness and of love and justice for our neighbors. In fact, Brueggemann asserts that, for Israel, “holiness and justice always come together.” In this radical new community, rest is a sign of the promise and vision of a community at peace, for the Sabbath is “perhaps Israel’s most stunning counter-cultural notion of justice…Israel asserts that ‘rest’ for self, for neighbor, and even for God is the goal and quintessence of life….a kind of ‘at-homeness’ that precludes hostility, competition, avarice, and insecurity…and anticipates a community of peace, well-being, and joy” (The Covenanted Self: Explorations in Law and Covenant, Fortress Press, page 50).   We live now in a culture that finds “morality” old-fashioned and almost quaint.  And yet, the people hunger for goodness.  Brueggemann challenges us to hear the commands in terms of story, for “Our Story Tells Us What to Do” (Peace, Chalice Press, page 66).  Remembering who we are and where we come from, the places (and the “bricks” of pharaohs) that God has delivered us from, enables us to hear and to re-tell the story in ways that lead us to recognize God’s shalom in remarkable ways, in our own lives and the lives of those around us. Morality, Brueggemann says, “is sorting out the demands and claims that emerge out of the precious moments when life is whole and new” (Peace, Chalice Press, page 69).  Where does your congregation get its sense of “right and wrong,” of morality?  What is the story that tells them what to do?  In what ways have they experienced exodus and, in Christian terms, resurrection?  Are these commandments rules from long ago that should be etched in stone, in our courthouses, for symbolic reasons perhaps more than practical ones, or are they etched deeply into our hearts, where we long for the wholeness and newness that God offers us?  Do you think our society sees these commands as matters of personal, private conduct, or of a public and communal morality that would indeed care for the “widow, the orphan, and the stranger” in our midst?  Rather than declaring our larger society a “Christian” one, do we see ourselves as a small, counter-cultural force, a community that has something to say to the larger forces pressing upon us, the militarism, the materialism, the greed and consumerism that set themselves up as rival gods to the God who brought us up, out of our own experiences of bondage and death?  Brueggemann speaks eloquently of the power of just such a community, long ago: The little community that begins in pain and ends in dancing, that stops its life for Sabbath, that cancels debts for the sake of neighborliness, in the end this community has in its midst the force for life, and is the wave of the future” (Texts that Linger, Words that Explode: Listening to Prophetic Voices, Fortress Press, page 78).

<!-- BEGIN OT READING -->

<P><B>Exodus 20:1-17</B>

<P>Then God spoke all these words:

<P>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.

<P>You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.

<P>You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.

<P>Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.

<P>Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.

<P>You shall not murder.

<P>You shall not commit adultery.

<P>You shall not steal.

<P>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

<P>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

<P><B>Psalm 19</B>

<P>Refrain:
<BR><B>
O God, you are my rock and my redeemer.
</B>

<P>The heavens are telling the glory of
<BR>God;
<BR>and the firmament proclaims God's
<BR>handiwork.

<P>Day to day pours forth speech,
<BR>and night to night declares
<BR>knowledge.

<P>There is no speech, nor are there
<BR>words;
<BR>their voice is not heard;

<P>yet their voice goes out through all
<BR>the earth,
<BR>and their words to the end of the
<BR>world.

<P>In the heavens God has set a tent for
<BR>the sun,
<BR>which comes our like a beloved
<BR>from a wedding canopy, and like an 
<BR>athlete runs its course with joy.

<P>Its rising is from the end of the
<BR>heavens,
<BR>and its circuit to the end of them,
<BR>and nothing is hid from its heat.

<P>The law of God is perfect, reviving
<BR>the soul;
<BR>the decrees of God are sure, making
<BR>wise the simple;

<P>the precepts of God are right,
<BR>rejoicing the heart;
<BR>the commandment of God is clear,
<BR>enlightening the eyes;

<P>the fear of God is pure, enduring forever;
<BR>the ordinances of God are true
<BR>and righteous altogether.

<P>More to be desired are they than
<BR>gold, even much fine gold;
<BR>sweeter also than honey, and
<BR>drippings of the honeycomb.

<P>Moreover by them is your servant
<BR>warned;
<BR>in keeping them there is great
<BR>reward.

<P>But who can detect their errors?
<BR>Clear me from hidden faults.

<P>Keep back your servant also from
<BR>the insolent;
<BR>do not let them have dominion
<BR>over me.

<P>Then I shall be blameless,
<BR>and innocent of great transgression.

<P>Let the words of my mouth and the
<BR>meditation of my heart be acceptable
<BR>to you,
<BR>O God, my rock and my redeemer.

<!-- BEGIN EPISTLE -->

<P><B>1 Corinthians 1:18-25</B>

<P>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,
	<BR>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
	<BR>and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”
<P>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. 

<P>For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.

<!-- BEGIN GOSPEL -->

<P><B>John 2:13-22</B>

<P>The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables. Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!” 

<P>His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?” Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?” But he was speaking of the temple of his body. After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.

<P>Third Sunday in Lent
<BR>March 19, 2006
<BR>Exodus 20:1-17

<B><p>GRAVEN IMAGES</B>

     <P>You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.                      — Exodus 20:4


    <P>When Roy Moore notoriously refused to remove the monumental display of the Ten Commandments he had placed in his courthouse rotunda, the Alabama judge not only defied the federal judiciary.  He also ignored the holy scriptures he so stoutly defended.
    <P>For the King James version got it right the first time: God said to Moses, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image....” Any carved stone idol or object of worship, that is; which is precisely what the now-disgraced judge had done.
    <P>Roy Moore and his followers defended their graven image on the ground that all human law derives from God’s commandments. For legal scholars, that is at best debatable. Indeed, until recently, when such issues as school prayer, abortion, and the teaching of creationism in science classes were raised in the courtroom, the deduction of legal principles from biblical or theological sources had been largely abandoned by lawyers and judges. Many believe that was a good thing.
    <P>In any case, perhaps the best, if not last, word belongs to Walter Harrelson, late of the Vanderbilt University Divinity School.  The Ten Commandments, he wrote, “were not intended to be legalistic in character or in effect; they were to ward off conduct from the community that could be its ruin. Positive law must develop in association with these negatively put demands. Rather than such ‘dos and don’ts’ encouraging oppressive control of a society by its leaders, they are a summons to a life freed to enjoy existence in community.”
    <P>A life freed to enjoy existence in community: not a bad definition of the promise of the Gospel.  And a  thought worthy of serious reflection in this Lenten Season.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
