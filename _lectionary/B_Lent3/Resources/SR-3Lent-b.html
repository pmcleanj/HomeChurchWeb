<h4>Scandal and Folly</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>22 Some people want signs from God that will
amaze them. Others want thoughts and feelings from God to make them
feel good. 23 But we talk about Jesus who died on the cross. The people
who look for God's signs think that's shocking. And, the people who
want good thoughts and feelings think that's worthless. 24 But, to the
people who God called to believe, the sight of Jesus on the cross
clearly shows God's power and wisdom. 25 God's foolishness is far
better than our wisdom. And God's weakness is far stronger than our
strength.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>22 For Jews request signs and Greeks seem
wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ having been crucified, to the Jews, on
the one hand, a scandal, to the Gentiles, on the other hand,
foolishness, 24 but to those called (by God), Jews and Greeks, Christ,
the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God
is wiser than men and the weakness of God (is) stronger than men.</b></p>
<p class="indent">1:23 "to the Gentiles" is literally "to the nations."
Both phrases referred to non-Jews. Since the universal language and
culture at the time were Greek, Paul used the terms "Gentile" and
"Greek" interchangeably.</p>
<p class="indent">1:25 "foolishness" in Greek is literally "moron."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul addressed the community at Corinth that was
torn apart with infighting. Various cliques formed factions represented
by teachers: Paul, Apollos, Peter, even Christ himself. (1:12) In
typical Greek fashion for the time, the Gentile groups appealed to
their teacher for wisdom. The Jewish Christian groups appealed to the
outward charism (i.e., speaking in tongues, prophecy, healing, etc.) of
the their teacher. In these few verses, Paul must have felt he was in
the midst of a cultural war! The practical Jews said, "Show me!" But
philosophic Greeks said, "Enlighten me!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul answered these factions with a greater
principle, a greater vision. Their new faith was more than heavenly
signs or divine insight. Faith was doing God's will. God gave his Son a
mission. Gather everyone and prepare them for the Kingdom. The Church
was established to continue that mission. Those who focused on signs or
wisdom simply wanted to be fed. So, Paul implicitly asked: "When will
you come together and feed others?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul showed the selfish a mirror that could show
shame or glory. That mirror was the image of Christ crucified. While
believers have looked on the crucifix as the sign of God's love and
have meditated on the cross for insight, they should also look upon the
image of the dead Master through pagan eyes. Jesus died a shameful
death, a loser's death. When a Jew became a believer, he or she
scandalized their family and community. Soon they were ejected from
their place and treated as if they never existed. In the popular
culture, Gentiles believers joined a fool's religion. (In fact, the
earliest image of the crucifix was graffiti. It had the picture of a
slave worshiping a crucified man on a cross. But the dead man had the
head of an ass. The inscription read, "Alexander worships his God.")
Whether the cross was shame or glory depended upon one's point of view:
popular culture's or God's.</p>
<p class="bodytext">On the surface, Paul used the image of the crucifix
as the "power of God" (for signs) and the "wisdom of God" (for
enlightenment). But, in the context of First Corinthians, he used the
image as a rallying point for unity. To become one in mind and heart.
To become one in purpose and outreach. After all, God has only one
purpose for the Church, even in his weakness or folly.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>True believers are willing to become "fools for
Christ." When have you risked your reputation for your faith? When have
others criticized you for being a Christian? What happened? How did
your folly make you a better Christian?</i></p>
