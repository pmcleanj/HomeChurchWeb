<h1><strong>Rules and Relationship</strong></h1>


<p>In my previous parish, I lived near Yellowstone National Park. At
the park entrance, the rangers hand out a map and other park
information. Included is an extensive list of park rules and
regulations. The important ones are also posted on signs throughout the
park. <em>Do not feed wildlife. Stay on walkways.&nbsp; Do not toss
objects into geysers or thermal pools. Do not pick the flowers. Keep
off the grass.</em> The rules are designed to protect both the park and
its visitors. With thousands of people visiting the park each year,
rules about such things as where to camp (<em>designated sites only</em>),   where to walk (<em>stay on path</em>) and what not to do (<em>do not remove   any artifacts</em>)
are necessary so that the place is not wrecked by the hordes of
visitors who come to enjoy it. Rules are also necessary to protect park
visitors from each other (<em>People on path below. Do   not throw objects off cliff!</em>) and from their own poor judgement   (<em>Warning! Many visitors have been gored by buffalo. Buffalo are dangerous!   Do not approach!</em>)
However, despite the preponderance of regulations, and the common-sense
nature of many of the rules, not a summer goes by without someone
getting injured or killed because they tried to get to get a close-up
photo of a bison, or fell into a thermal pool, or tried to pass another
car in a no-passing zone and got in a head-on collision. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rules are an integral part of human community. And yet they can be
troublesome. Some rules seem so obvious that they can be remain
unspoken, at least until someone breaks one.&nbsp; Some rules are
clearly necessary, but others are overbearing.&nbsp; Some rules are
useful, and are forged in the crucible of tragic experiences, while
other rules are enacted in order to prevent hypothetical situations
from occurring, and thus can be overly bureaucratic and even
ridiculous.&nbsp; Some rules, although useful when they were enacted,
have become outdated, and are either hopelessly obsolete or need to be
translated into a new context.&nbsp; The hard part is that there aren&#8217;t
any hard and fast rules about when to ignore or change the rules! </p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>Although
these are commonly referred to as &#8220;The Ten Commandments,&#8221; that phrase
does not actually occur in this passage.&nbsp; However, such details
aside, these words from God are designed to protect our relationship
with God and with our neighbors.&nbsp; These commandments establish
boundaries in which all may be safe. They begin with God&#8217;s
self-declaration about God&#8217;s identity and relationship with Israel: &#8220;I
am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt&#8221; (vs.
2). The commandments flow out from that starting point. God says, in
effect, &#8220;This is who I am and this is what I have done for you.
Therefore, this is how you are to live....&#8221; </p>

      <p>In these
words there is both threat and grace. Disobedience has consequences
which are not to be ignored or taken lightly (see verses 5 and
7).&nbsp; The threat of punishment underscores the importance of the
commandments. That threat is specifically attached to the commandments
concerning one&#8217;s relationship with God, which never ceases to amaze my
confirmation classes, who always guess that the *big* threat is
attached to an &#8220;important&#8221; commandment like the one about murder.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Exodus 20:5 ties the threat of multi-generational
punishment to violation of the commandment about idol worship. God&#8217;s
gracious, all-encompassing claim on us ought to leave no room for
apostasy.&nbsp; The text does not mince words: one&#8217;s actions have
consequences, not only for oneself, but also for one&#8217;s children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.&nbsp; While one might think it
unfair of God to blame a person for their great grandparents&#8217; sins, in
a very real sense, we are affected by the choices our parents,
grandparents, and great-grandparents made. For instance, had my
paternal grandfather not died young, my father&#8217;s life would have turned
out differently, and the chain of decisions which led my grandmother to
Bellingham, where my father ultimately met my mother, would not have
happened.&nbsp; The point of this passage is not to focus on the past
and lay blame on one&#8217;s ancestors for one&#8217;s personal problems, but to
raise our awareness that our current actions have consequences &#8211; not
just for ourselves, but for our entire family system. This passage
invites us to consider our actions in light of what it means for our
futures. There is also the promise of blessing for those who stand in
right relationship with God (verse 4), and with their parents (verse
12). That promise (steadfast love to the thousandth generation) far
outweighs the threat (punishment visited upon the third and fourth
generation).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The rationale for commandment to
observe the Sabbath (verses 8-11) grows out of God&#8217;s creative work.
Just as God rested on the seventh day, so too, everyone is to rest
including one&#8217;s children, slaves, foreigners, and livestock.&nbsp; In
contrast, Deuteronomy 5:12-15 connects the command for Sabbath rest to
God&#8217;s redemptive activity in the Exodus. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The rest
of the commandments are stated without threat or rationale. These are
the rules which are the building blocks for human community, for they
protect life, relationship, and property. </p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading </h4>
      <p>Paul
leads the reader in a circular discussion about wisdom and folly. The
wise ones of the world don&#8217;t understand the meaning of the cross
because God has chosen &#8220;foolishness&#8221; instead of wisdom as a means of
revealing God&#8217;s action and purpose in the world. The fact that the
world&#8217;s wisdom cannot comprehend God doesn&#8217;t imply that the Christian
claim about God is to be rejected as nonsense; instead, it means that
God&#8217;s wisdom is greater than human wisdom. The route to understanding
the cross is found neither in human wisdom nor human reason, but in
faithful reliance on God&#8217;s power. The rules of logic and rhetoric won&#8217;t
lead one to faith. Faith comes in the gift of being in relationship
with Christ. &nbsp;</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
	  <p>John&#8217;s
version of Jesus driving the moneychangers out of temple differs
significantly from the three synoptic gospels. Whereas Matthew, Mark,
and Luke place the cleansing of the temple at the end of Jesus&#8217;
ministry, after his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (see Matthew
21:12-13, Mark 11:15-19, Luke 19:45-46), John sets it at the beginning
of Jesus&#8217; ministry. John&#8217;s account relishes the small details,
carefully describing the inventory that is being sold, and the blow-by
blow account of driving out the livestock, pouring out the coins,
overturning tables, and telling the dove-sellers to cease and desist.
In John&#8217;s account, Jesus&#8217; actions are explained by his zeal for his
Father&#8217;s house (a quotation from Psalm 69:9). And, in contrast to the
synoptics&#8217; objections that the commercial activity in the temple
disrupts its purpose of being a &#8220;house of prayer for all nations;&#8221; in
John&#8217;s gospel, Jesus objects to turning &#8220;his Father&#8217;s house&#8221; into a
commercial emporium (see Zechariah 14:21).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In
response to the demand for a sign (verse 18), Jesus challenges them to
destroy the temple and he will raise it in three days (verse 19).&nbsp;
This is a double entendre, typical of the Johannine use of
misunderstanding as a literary device. The characters in the story
don&#8217;t understand. They think Jesus is talking about the Jerusalem
temple, while Jesus is speaking of his own body. This both foreshadows
his death, and also provides a retrospective for the disciples, who
gain understanding (and come to faith) by their future remembrance of
this episode (verse 22).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>For Jesus, the issue
boils down to relationship. Using the temple as a marketplace, although
convenient for worshipers needing to buy animals for sacrifices and
exchange their offering money for temple currency (which, unlike Roman
coinage bearing the likeness of Caesar, lacked any &#8216;graven image&#8217;),
violated the temple&#8217;s purpose as a place devoted solely to worshiping
God. </p>
      <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>Which statement most closely expresses your attitude toward rules?</p>
<ul>
<li>"Rules are meant to be broken"</li>
<li>"There's an exception to every rule."</li>
<li>"It's important to play by the rules."</li>
</ul>
<p>Under what circumstance would each of those statements be true? Under what circumstances would it be false?</p>
<p>2. What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;good rules&#8221; and &#8220;bad rules&#8221;?&nbsp;
How do you know when it is right to ignore or change a rule? On what
basis do you make those decisions?&nbsp; In what ways do rules help
establish and maintain healthy relationships? In what ways do rules get
in the way of healthy relationships? &nbsp;</p>
<p>3.What do you see as the purpose of the 10 commandments?&nbsp; Do
you see them as rigid or flexible? As you hear Exodus 20:1-17 as a word
of God addressed to you, how would you describe God&#8217;s tone of voice? As
you consider the 10 commandments, do you find them to be more of a
burden or a blessing? In what way&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.If Jesus were to show up on your congregation&#8217;s doorstep this
weekend, how would he react to what he found going on there?&nbsp; What
might he want to &#8220;drive out&#8221;? What would he bless?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
