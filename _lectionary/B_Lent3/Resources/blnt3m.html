<B>Exodus</B>
<P>
Exodus is the second book of the Old Testament, and is part of the Pentateuch,
the first five books of the Bible. Jews refer to these books as "The Torah".
At times, they are referred to as "The Law", although "Torah" means <I>teaching</I>.
Exodus centres on the rescue of God's chosen people from captivity in Egypt
and the making of the great covenant, or agreement with God, at Mount Sinai.

<STRONG>Exodus 20:1-17</STRONG>
<P>The giving of the Ten Commandments marks the starting point of Israel as a self-defining community. They form a covenant between God and Israel but, unlike God&#8217;s agreements with Noah and Abraham, here both parties have a stake in it, and 
either can break it. (In the earlier covenants, God acts and promises but the recipients passively receive &#8211; although they do have obligations.)</P>
<P>Having arrived at Mount Sinai, the Israelites clean themselves physically and ritually, but it is Moses and Aaron who ascend the mountain. God speaks to <U>all</U>, to the whole community. But why does God enter into the agreement? In

those who intentionally &#8220;reject&#8221; him, but rewards with compassion those who love him and follow his ways. Those who use God&#8217;s name for a false or evil purpose (e.g. for casting spells, doing magic) will not be <EM>acquitted</EM>

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

Isaiah referring to events that occurred when Assyria was threatening Judah. The king's counsellor (a &#8220;wise&#8221; man, one versed in popular philosophy) advised alliance with Egypt, but Isaiah told the king to do nothing but trust in the 
Lord: God would save Israel and bring to nothing the &#8220;wisdom of the wise&#8221; and the &#8220;discernment&#8221; (intelligence) &#8220;of the discerning&#8221;. From other sources, we know that there were many &#8220;wise&#8221; citizens of 
Corinth, each of whom had their own solutions to the world's problems. The Greek philosopher and the Jewish scribe count as nothing before God, Paul says: God's wisdom is different: you can't &#8220;know&#8221; (v.

<B>John</B>
<P>
John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<STRONG>John 2:13-22</STRONG>
<P>Perhaps John contrasts &#8220;the Passover of the Jews&#8221; with the sacrifice of our &#8220;pascal lamb, Christ&#8221; (1 Corinthians 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+5%3A7" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">5:7</A>). Jesus, as did many Jews, 
goes &#8220;up to Jerusalem&#8221; 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+2%3A13" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true"></A>for the feast. In the forecourt of 
the Temple, he finds merchants selling animals and birds for sacrifices, and money changers exchanging coins bearing idolatrous images for coins used to pay the temple tax. Jesus throws both traders and animals out of the temple precincts, insisting 
that commercial activities (especially shady ones) have no place here (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+2%3A16" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">16</A>). (V.

against the regulation of the Jewish sacrificial system by the religious authorities: it oppressed most people and enriched the traders and money changers.) Note that Jesus claims that God is his <EM>Father</EM> and sees the Temple as worthy of 
respect. The disciples recall Psalm 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Psalms+69%3A9" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">69:9</A> - here a prophecy that 
Jesus&#8217; &#8220;zeal&#8221; (v.

for his (violent) action; his reply (v.

challenging them to replace temple worship with belief in him. Lacking faith, they take it literally (and misunderstand), but John tells us that Jesus is saying that, by his resurrection (&#8220;three days&#8221;) he will become a new <EM>spiritual 
temple</EM>, replacing the Temple. The disciples only understand this after the first Easter. It helps them to believe in Jesus and his message of good news.</P>
