									<h4>Fear and Worry</h4>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>What causes people worry about their security and their future?</i></p>
									<p class="bodytext">Worry,
anxiety, fear. Americans seem to invite anxiety even in the best of
times. Some people not only worry, they wallow in it. Fear becomes a
lifestyle that demands some sort of therapy, some sort of drug, some
sort of insurance. An atmosphere of extreme concern causes some to live
indoors and in the shadows.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">What can
help people break out of fear, anxiety, and worry? A trust in something
greater than themselves. When people lose themselves to fear, they
realize they are not in control. They live in sheer chaos. When they
realize that God is truly in control, and that all they need to do is
to trust God, they can live without anxiety. They can live openly, in
peace.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">In Matthew's gospel, Jesus spoke to his front line, his Apostles, on fear and the need for faith.</p>
									<p class="maroontext"><b>Children's Translation</b></p>
									<p class="maroontext"><b>Jesus told the followers he sent out to serve the people:</b></p>
									<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">26
Don't be afraid of others! For everything you try to cover up will be
uncovered. And all your secrets will be known. 27 What I told you in
the dark, tell everyone in the light. What you heard me whisper in your
ear, shout to everyone from the top of your house. 28 Don't be afraid
of people who kill you. They kill your body, not your spirit. But be
more afraid of God, the one who can destroy your body and spirit in
hell.</font></b></p>
									<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">29
Can't you buy two sparrows for a penny? Yet, one of them will not fall
to the ground unless your Father wishes it. 30 But, all the hairs on
your heads been counted (by your Father). 31 So, don't be afraid.
You're worth so much more than a lot of sparrows!</font></b></p>
									<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">32
I will tell my Father in heaven about anyone who says to other people,
"I belong to Jesus." But, in front of my Father in heaven, I will
reject anyone who says to others, "I reject Jesus."</font></b></p>
									<p class="bluetext"></p>
									<p class="bodytext">Jesus
discussed three sources of fear for the Christian: worry about
self-revelation, fear of persecution, anxiety over personal need. None
of these fears outweigh the responsibility of the Christian to spread
the Good News.</p>
									<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
									<p class="bluetext"><font color="#ee0000"><b>26
So, you should not fear them. For nothing is (now) covered which will
not be uncovered and (now) hidden which will be known. 27 What I say to
you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear (secretly) in you
ear, announce on the roof (tops).</b></font></p>
									<p class="indent">26b
was a proverb in the midst of commands. The proverb referred to daily
existence in an extended family that lived in the same neighbor for
generations. In such a tightly knit community, nothing could be covered
up or kept a secret forever. Indeed, in the time of Jesus, adults
trained children to freely walk into others' apartments and houses so
they could spy, for no one locked their houses up during the day!</p>
									<p class="indent">On
the one hand, people distrust the stranger and those who dodge an
issue. But, since people need privacy, they raised lies, deception, and
counter-rumors to an art form. On the other hand, knowledge of others'
business did have a social benefit. People can trust others who have
nothing to hide.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Jesus instructed his
Apostles to reveal all and to live a transparent life in order to gain
the trust of people. Beyond the issue of trust, however, remained the
issue of symbol. The Apostles proclaimed the ministry of the Messiah,
the coming of the end times. At the final judgement, God would reveal
all secrets and the saints would live in transparent glory. To convince
an audience, the Apostles would need to present themselves as if they
already lived such a transparent life in the Kingdom! [10:27]</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>How hard is it to live a transparent life, a life without secrets? What part of life is "nobody's business?"</i></p>
									<p class="bluetext"><b><font color="#ee0000">28
Do not fear the (ones) killing the body, but not being able to kill the
soul. Fear more the (One) being able to destroy the body and soul in
Gehenna.</font></b></p>
									<p class="indent">10:28 "soul" means
the essence of the self. The verse can be translated: "Don't be afraid
of those who can destroy your body. They cannot destroy the real 'you.'"</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Such
a transparent life would be honest, but it would leave the Apostles
vulnerable. Living honestly cast an unfavorable shadow on those who
have a secret to keep or something to hide. The dishonest could become
jealous and soon rage against the honest. The dishonest would use
guile, ill wit, rumor, and even persecution justify themselves against
the honest. Yes, they could kill the body (both of the individual
Apostles and the Christian community), but they could not kill the
spirit.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Ultimately, the Christian
should live as if the day of judgement had already arrived. They should
live with everything uncovered before God, for God was the only thing
that really mattered. Only he could condemn both body and soul.</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>Why do many Christians worry about what others think of them? How can you help them overcome such anxiety?</i></p>
									<p class="bluetext"><font color="#ee0000"><b>29
Are not two sparrows sold (for a small coin)? And one of them will not
fall onto the ground without (the will of the) Father. 30 But even your
hairs on (your) head, all have been counted. 31 So, do not be afraid.
You have more worth than (a flock of) many sparrows.</b></font></p>
									<p class="indent">10:29
"(for a small coin)" is literally "(for an) assarion." An assarion was
a small copper coin worth one-sixteenth of a denarii, the coin of a
day's wage. If someone earned $100 a day, an assarion would be worth
$6.25.</p>
									<p class="indent">"without (the will of the) Father" is literally "without the Father."</p>
									<p class="bodytext">In
the time of Jesus, "sparrow" was a common term used for many different
types of small birds, not necessarily a particular species. Town
merchants sold small birds in marketplaces as one of the few meat
sources for the poor. The coin (an "assarion") used to pay for two
birds was Roman in origin.</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Jesus used
the analogy of size to emphasize God's providence. Everything in the
world depended upon God's will. The flight of a small bird. And even
something smaller, the hair on one's head. If he directed such things
of small worth, how much more will God care for his people!</p>
									<p class="bodytext">Three
times, Jesus tells his audience not to worry (10:26, 28, 31) Don't
worry to be open about faith, don't worry about powerful opponents,
don't worry about one's fate. All three lay in God's hands.</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>How can you lay your personal daily needs before the Lord? How will such a daily offering help you?</i></p>
									<p class="bluetext"><font color="#ee0000"><b>32
So, anyone who acknowledges me in the presence of men, I will also
acknowledge him in the presence of my Father, the One in heaven. 33
But, whoever should deny me in the presence of men, I will also deny
him in the presence of my Father, the One in heaven.</b></font></p>
									<p class="bodytext">Faith
could have a high cost: loss of privacy, persecution, and a loss of
self-determination. But a single benefit outweighed the cost: an
advocate before God. At the time of Jesus, when some prophets cried out
for God's judgement and the end seemed immanent, people asked
themselves "Where do I stand before God?" The Sadducees hid behind
Temple cult. The Pharisees held to observance of the Law as
justification. But, the Christian took comfort in the words "I belong
to Jesus." Unlike worship ritual or religious duty, the Christian had a
personal mediator, a go-between who could plead the case of the
follower. Jesus would advocate for the faithful, but reject the
apostate.</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>How can I freely share my Christian commitment with others?</i></p>
									<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: Morality and the Passions<br>
										(CCC 1763-1770)</p>
									<p class="indent">"Passions"
are emotions that drive us to action or inaction when a moral dilemma
faces us. Some passions like love focus on the good in life, while
others like fear and hatred help us avert evil.</p>
									<p class="indent">Passions
are morally neutral; their morality depend upon their use. When we use
they for a good end, we make them virtuous. When we use them for a evil
end, we make them immoral. A feeling of love or ecstatic in itself does
not make us good. In the same way, feelings of hatred or inadequacy
does not make us evil or deficient.</p>
									<p class="indent">We
need passions a such as the will to accomplish the moral good. But most
of all, we need the movement of Spirit who empowers us toward the good.</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>Have you ever been challenged as a Christian? Have you ever felt God relieve you of worry or anxiety?</i></p>
									<p class="bodytext">Worry,
anxiety, fear. These emotions result from perceived or real threats.
Matthew's gospel presents an antidote, a way to live through these
threats. Faith in God will lead us through discomfort, conflict, and
persecutions. For God always remains faithful to us. Can we remain
faithful to him?</p>
									<p class="bodytext"><i>List your
worries, rational or not. In your mind, place them before God. Pray for
the strength to focus on the Lord through prayer, in spite of worry. </i></p>
