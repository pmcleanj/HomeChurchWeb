<b>Genesis</b>
</a></small><p>
<small><a name="Genesis">Genesis is the first book of the Bible. It begins with two versions of the 
creation story, neither of them intended to be scientific but telling us why 
we are on earth. In the story of Adam and Eve, it tells us that we are 
responsible, under God, for the care of all creation. It then continues with 
the stories of the patriarchs: Abraham (who enters into a covenant (or treaty) 
with God), Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.

<strong>Genesis 21:8-21</strong>
<p>Isaac has been born to Abraham and Sarah, in their old age, and has
been circumcised, a sign of being one of God&#8217;s people. Sarah has said,
&#8220;God has brought laughter for me&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+21%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>). Now aged three, Isaac is 
weaned: an occasion for a religious feast.

&#8220;the son of Hagar&#8221; (v.

but he is not named in today's reading &#8211; an indication that he ranks
lower than Isaac. (When Sarah was unable to bear Abraham a son, he
exercised the legal option of producing an heir through a slave woman.)
Sarah sees Ishmael &#8220;playing&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+21%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>, or <em>laughing</em>) with 
Isaac (meaning <em>he laughs</em>). She sees a real threat to her own life so she asks Abraham to &#8220;cast out&#8221; (v.

Hagar and Ishmael. Abraham hesitates, for he loves Ishmael and ancient
law forbade such a deed. God says to Abraham: go ahead, do as she asks,
I will solve the problem; your line will continue through Isaac, and
Ishmael will also become father of a nation (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+21%3A12-13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12-13</a>).
Abraham is obedient to God: he provides Hagar with provisions, and
throws her and her son out. When the water is exhausted, Hagar realizes
that death is near (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+21%3A15-16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">15-16</a>). God hears Ishmael's 
cry (Ishmael means <em>God harkens</em>); Hagar sees a well. &#8220;God was with the boy&#8221; (v.

nomad (&#8220;expert with the bow&#8221;), lives in northern Sinai (&#8220;Paran&#8221;, v.

&#8211; all points which indicate his exclusion from God's specific plan. Genesis continues with the story of Isaac.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 86:1-10,16-17</strong>
<p>That the speaker is &#8220;poor and needy&#8221; (two equivalent terms) suggests
that he is a king, for such repetition is found in royal inscriptions
from the ancient Near East. He cries (prays) continually for God to <em>preserve his life</em> 
(v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+86%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>). He presents his very being 
to God (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+86%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>), who is &#8220;good 
and forgiving&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+86%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>) and 
gives love to all who ask. He is confident that God will hear him (vv.

&#8220;teach me your way ... that I may walk in your truth&#8221; (v.

love for him (as seen in rescuing him from grave illness) with his enemies&#8217; attitude towards God: one of <em>insolence</em>, of ignoring God&#8217;s ways. He confesses his faith (v.

in words God spoke to Moses. He seeks God&#8217;s support, considering
himself without any right to ask. (A girl born of a slave had no rights
of any kind.) He prays for a &#8220;sign&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+86%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>) of his continuing esteem in 
God&#8217;s eyes: that this may show his enemies that their cause is hopeless. For us, vv.

<b>Romans</b>
</small><p>
<small>Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

<strong>Romans 6:1b-11</strong>
<p>Paul has written of life before Christ: death was final, and &#8220;where sin increased, grace abounded all the more&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+5%3A20" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:20</a>). He now asks rhetorically: 
are we to go on sinning in order to receive even more grace? (Is this the basis for Christian morality?) His answer is <em>definitely not!</em>, and another question (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>).
Baptism makes the difference for Christians. In baptism, we die to sin.
We are baptised into Christ's death, as well as into his resurrection.
We too are raised from death by the Father, so that we may &#8220;walk&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) in the new life. <em>Walking</em> 
implies conscience-based ethical conduct. There is no room for wanton sin in such a life.</p>
<p>Just as we have been grafted on to Christ in his death, so we too will share with him through a resurrection like his (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>). We know that we ceased to be 
dominated by sin and divine wrath (&#8220;our old self&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) when we were baptised. This 
removed the effects of our waywardness, our <em>enslavement to sin</em>, but makes us ethically responsible for our actions. This is what baptism does (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>). Dying with Christ also includes 
living with him. Because Christ has risen, he will &#8220;never die again&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>) &#8211; this is unique, 
once-for-all-time act, an anticipation of the age to come. And then the answer to the question in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>:
Christ &#8220;died to sin&#8221; in the sense that sinless, he died rather than
disobey the Father, and in the context of a sinful world. He was raised
by the Father (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>) in order that he might live 
&#8220;to God&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>,
as he has always done.) So, as Christ is the model for our lives, and
it is he upon whom our lives are grafted, we too must leave sin behind
and be &#8220;alive to God&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+6%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>) in Christ.</p>

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for <i>Quelle</i>, German for <i>source</i>).
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 60 to 70 AD, possibly for a
largely Jewish audience.

<strong>Matthew 10:24-39</strong>
<p>Jesus continues to prepare the twelve for the continuation of his mission. He is both &#8220;teacher&#8221; and &#8220;master&#8221;. His <em>disciples</em> are students. There is so much to learn that they should never set themselves up as 
authorities independent of him. He has been called &#8220;Beelzebul&#8221;, (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A25" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">25</a>,
the prince of demons); his disciples will be called worse. Do not be
intimidated. At the end of the era, all ungodly and godly behaviour,
now hidden, will be <em>made known</em> (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26</a>). Now is the time to proclaim 
all that Jesus has told his disciples privately (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>). Do not fear your persecutors 
for they can only end your physical life; rather hold God in awe, for he can &#8220;destroy&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A28" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">28</a>) you totally if you do not do 
his will. God cares for the life of even a <em>sparrow</em> (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A29" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">29</a>, sold as food in the market), 
so &#8220;do not be afraid&#8221; (v.

Honest and forthright witness &#8211; and outright refusal to do so &#8211; will have eternal consequences (vv. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A32-33" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">32-33</a>).
At the Last Day, Jesus will testify to the Father for those who have
witnessed faithfully; he will declare those who turn against the gospel
unworthy of life in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Jesus gives a new interpretation to Micah 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Micah+7%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7:6</a>, a verse thought to foretell the 
breakdown of society as the end-times approach (vv.

Spreading the gospel will have unfortunate side-effects. There will be
tension and division (even within families) between those who accept
Jesus&#8217; message, and the demands it makes, and those who oppose his way.
Christians must put loyalty to him above family loyalties (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A37" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">37</a>). Following 
Jesus involves the risk of death (&#8220;cross&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A38" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">38</a>). Finally, a paradox: if one 
aims to preserve one&#8217;s earthly life, one will lose all (&#8220;life&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+10%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">39</a>), but one who dies for Jesus 
will find true life, eternal life.</p>
