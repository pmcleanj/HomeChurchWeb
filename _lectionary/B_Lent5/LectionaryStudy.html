	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;new
	covenant&quot; - I wonder how many times in the scriptures God tries
	to renew a covenant with God's people. How many times would you try
	again with someone who had betrayed, neglected, hurt, or forgotten
	you? </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;I will
	put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I
	will be their God, and they shall be my people.&quot; This is God
	wanting a real relationship with people, for God to be the one to
	whom the people belong. Imagine, if God's law is on our hearts,
	within us, perhaps we can learn better to live by its <I>spirit </I>and
	not by its <I>letter. </I>God is trying a different approach in this
	new covenant - a law of love we carry inside of us. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;they shall know me, from the least
	of them to the greatest&quot; - God is for all - not just for the
	knowledgeable and educated, who have power to teach others - God is
	for all. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I><B>Psalm 51:1-12:</B></I></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ah, a favorite
	psalm. And like Joel, an element of confession. This psalm is one
	I'm mostly likely to use if I'm feeling the need to come before God
	in a confessional mode. Do you have a confessional prayer in church
	every week? We do not, and I think as Protestants, we sometimes get
	nervous about confession, even corporate. But even if we don't share
	sins with a priest, confession is a necessary part of our
	relationship - any healthy relationship, really.</FONT> 
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Where I disagree with the psalmist,
	(thought to be David writing after the sin with Bathsheba) is in his
	claim: &quot;against you, you alone, have I sinned.&quot; Rarely do
	our sins only affect God - that's the worst about them - our sin
	hurts others. David's sin, for instance, resulted in a man's death,
	and a child's death, according to scriptures. </FONT>

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">I don't usually
	think of Jesus as a &quot;high priest.&quot; What priestly functions
	do you see Jesus filling? How is Jesus priest? The author gives his
	answer in verses 7-10. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">:8 - I also don't think of Jesus as one
	who had to &quot;learn&quot; obedience, but as one who simply was
	obedient. But maybe there is more power in thinking of Jesus
	learning to obey God through his faithfulness to God's plan for him.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I><B>John 12:20-33:</B></I></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">:24 - This
	verse is often used in funeral liturgies/readings. We probably don't
	think of grain dying when we plant it, but grain becomes something
	entirely different when it is planted. Are you willing to be
	planted, to be come something entirely different? </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">:25 - Compare
	this verse to Mark 8:35 - Is Jesus saying the same thing in each
	passage? </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial">:27 - &quot;Now
	my soul is troubled.&quot; I think the only other place Jesus makes
	a similar statement is when he is praying in the garden before his
	arrest. I think it can be a brave thing to share when your soul is
	troubled. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">:27-32 - Jesus makes so many &quot;grand
	speeches&quot; in John's gospel, so different than his style as
	recorded in the Synoptic gospels. What do you think John is trying
	to communicate to us about Jesus? </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
