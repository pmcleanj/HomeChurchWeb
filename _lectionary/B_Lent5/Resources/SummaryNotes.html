		<H2 CLASS="western">Commentary on First Reading by <A HREF="http://www.workingpreacher.org/contributor_detail.aspx?author_id=146">Charles
		L. Aaron, Jr.</A></H2>
		<P CLASS="western">In the first chapter of this book six verbs
		define the ministry of Jeremiah: pluck up, pull down, destroy,
		overthrow, build and plant (1:10). 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="western">Throughout much of the book, the prophet has
		plucked up, pulled down, destroyed and overthrown as he accused the
		people of violating the covenant that God had established with them
		(especially chapter 11). Beginning in chapter 30, the so-called
		book of consolations, the prophet builds and plants (31:4). These
		words, whether from the historical prophet or not, were most
		relevant to the dispirited exiles who desperately needed to be
		built up.<BR><BR>Among the consolations were the promises that God
		would relent of anger (30:24) and return the people to their home
		(31:8). God's love and faithfulness will be manifest (31:3). The
		people will experience prosperity (31:5) and joy (31:13). All of
		these are comforting promises to people who need to hear a good
		word. Such promises would be remarkable enough just by themselves.
		However, this particular passage promises even more.<BR><BR>Here,
		Jeremiah promises a new covenant between God and the people. The
		offer of a renewed covenant is itself a manifestation of God's
		forgiveness.&nbsp; These words here push the promise even deeper
		and in a new direction.&nbsp; Through the words of the prophet, God
		promises to write the law on the hearts of the people.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Even
		if God restores the people to the land, enables them to experience
		prosperity and joy and shows love to them again, that will not be
		enough. Something must change within the people themselves. Here
		God promises to heal them from the inside out. God will change not
		only their outward circumstances, but their very hearts. <BR><BR>The
		passage contains some technical language that can be unpacked. A
		covenant is an agreement between two parties. God is in the
		position of determining the conditions of the agreement. Usually a
		covenant involved promises from the superior party in exchange for
		the proper response from the other party. Here God takes
		responsibility even for the response from the people. God will
		empower the people to uphold their end of the agreement.<BR><BR>The
		word for law can also be translated as teaching or instruction. The
		usual translation of law is technically correct, but does not carry
		the sense of grace that the translation &quot;teaching&quot;
		conveys. The &quot;law&quot; teaches the people how to live in
		harmony and stability.<BR><BR>As Augustine suggested, the law
		teaches us how to love. Psalms 19 and 119 reveal the proper
		attitude toward the law. &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect,
		reviving the soul&quot; (Psalm 19:7). Psalm 119 proclaims that the
		law is a delight leading to success, even in competition and
		conflict (Psalm 119:98). Jeremiah recognizes that something deep
		within us resists the law and teaching of God. We embrace the
		foolishness of resistance to God's will. By writing the
		law/teaching on our hearts, God will bypass that resistance,
		enabling us to experience the delight, prosperity, joy and harmony
		that the law provides.<BR><BR>Along with the author of Psalm 51,
		who implored God to create a clean heart within him and put a new,
		upright spirit in him, Jeremiah and the psalmist knew that change
		comes only from the inside out. But, God must take the initiative.
		We are not as wise as the psalmist so we ask for God to work within
		us. The psalmist asked only on his own behalf, whereas the prophet
		envisions God writing the law on the hearts of the whole community.
		Only when the whole community relishes the law/teaching of God can
		everyone live in harmony and peace.<BR><BR>This is the reading for
		the last Sunday in Lent. It may be a time when we are most aware of
		our inability to follow God's teachings and God's will. If we have
		been trying to use Lent as a genuine time to grow in obedience, we
		will realize our weakness and powerlessness to be what God calls us
		to be. If we have let Lent slip by without a thought to our
		spiritual growth, then we know we are unwilling even to make the
		effort. <BR><BR>This promise of God doing for us what we cannot or
		will not do on our own can then become a welcome word of
		refreshment. God will write the law on our hearts. Our growth, our
		sanctification is not all up to us.<BR><BR>We might ask what the
		prophet had in mind for this passage. When did he think that God
		would act in this way? Did he think that God's initiative to write
		the law/teaching on our hearts would be part of the return from
		exile? Did he have any eschatological expectations? Did he simply
		hold out a promise of God's sanctification, knowing our weakness
		and God's power?<BR><BR>We do not have definite answers to those
		questions. We can affirm only that our obedience is God's will for
		us. God will accomplish God's purposes. We claim the gift of the
		resurrection when God will accomplish God's will for us and for all
		creation.<BR><BR>We are most ready to hear these words when our own
		efforts are exhausted. When we are weary of our inner turmoil we
		are ready to hear Jeremiah. When we are weary of broken
		relationships and the uncertainty of trusting others, we are ready
		to hear Jeremiah. When we are weary of our intermittent
		relationship with God, occasionally close but more likely far away,
		we are ready to hear Jeremiah. If we have tried to shake off a bad
		habit or we are tired of trying to improve ourselves, we are ready
		to hear Jeremiah</P>

				<H2 CLASS="western">Commentary on Psalm by <A HREF="http://www.workingpreacher.org/contributor_detail.aspx?author_id=143">Robert
				L. Hubbard, Jr.</A></H2>
				<P CLASS="western">A single voice speaks to us in this text. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">Its words ring of agony, pain, desperation,
				brokenness, and great remorse. The speaker directly addresses God
				himself, but God says nothing. Instead, this text invites us to
				eavesdrop on one side of a two-party conversation with God. <BR><BR>Who
				is speaking? The psalm title identifies the person as David,
				writing sometime after Nathan condemned him for adultery with
				Bathsheba (see 2 Samuel 12:1-14). This is possible, but a later
				editor probably penned the connection between the psalm and that
				seamy episode. Whatever the case, the title at least offers a
				powerful and infamous example of the kind of sin the psalm has in
				mind.<BR><BR>Structurally, the voice opens with heartfelt pleas
				for mercy and cleansing from sin (verses 1-2) and supports them
				with a long confession of sin (verses 3-6). A series of pleas for
				radical renewal (verses 7-12) gives its desperate outcry a
				powerful, closing crescendo.<BR><BR><B>A Black-and-White
				Negative</B><BR><BR>What immediately grabs my attention are the
				striking contrasts the speaker's words paint. Before the digital
				era, cameras shot film, and photos were copied from &quot;negatives&quot;
				- film with the light/dark polarities reversed. Like the negative
				of a snapshot, the psalm pictures everything as starkly black and
				white, the polar opposite of what it should be.</P>

				<P CLASS="western">I imagine dear Pigpen of the &quot;Peanuts&quot;
				cartoons and guys in movies who've just brawled in slimy mud and

				feel grimy, filthy, and in desperate need of a bath, too. Whoever
				the voice is, I know s/he's talking about me!&nbsp; I desperately
				need cleansing and renewed joy, too.<BR><BR><B>Full Disclosure</B><BR><BR>I
				confess that I'm not a big fan of Lent. Give me Christmas and
				Easter and I'm a happy Christian! The reason is that I wasn't
				raised in a Christian clan that observed Lent. Ironically,
				however, every Sunday was like Lent, calling me to &quot;get
				right with God.&quot; I took God very, very seriously, but the
				week-after-week drumbeat gave me a spiritual inferiority
				complex.<BR><BR>Twice a year, I see my doctor for a physical
				checkup. He monitors my vital signs and points me in the
				direction of good health. Today I embrace Lent as an annual
				spiritual checkup to see where I'm at and to renew my
				relationship with God. But, please, annually, not
				weekly!<BR><BR><B>Getting the Color Back in Life</B><BR><BR>The
				stark contrasts drive home another point: the impossibility of
				self-reformation drives me (with the speaker) back to God. I (and
				he) do so for two reasons:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because God is
					the one I've (s/he's) so horribly offended (verse 4), the dear,
					long-time friend with whom I (and s/he) crave reconciliation.</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western">Because only God can do the
					&quot;blotting-out,&quot; &quot;cleansing,&quot; &quot;ignoring,&quot;
					and &quot;purifying,&quot; etc. In computer terms, only God can
					hit the &quot;restore&quot; key.</P>
				</UL>
				<P CLASS="western"><B>Hit &quot;Pause&quot; to Ponder</B><BR><BR>At
				this point my mind hits the &quot;Pause&quot; button to ponder
				what kind of God I (and the psalmist) face. God has said nothing,
				so I search the psalmist's words for a theological straw or two
				to grasp.&nbsp; My eyes drift between two key phrases: &quot;Have
				mercy on me!&quot; (<I>hanani</I>, verse 1) and &quot;Cleanse me&quot;
				(<I>tehatte'eni</I>, verse 7).<BR><BR>The first cry reminds me
				that God is a God of mercy. My mind replays tapes of sinful
				humans like me voicing that truth:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That's what
					Moses tells Israel camped near the Jordan (Deuteronomy 4:31).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That's why a
					guilty David casts his fate in God's (rather than his enemies')
					hands (2 Samuel 24:14).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That fuels the
					climactic cry of hope by the prophet Micah (Micah 7:18-20).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That's why God
					sent Jonah to Nineveh (Jonah 4:2).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That underlies
					Jesus' climactic cry on the cross for forgiveness (Luke 23:34).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western">That drives Paul's dramatic declaration
					about &quot;no condemnation&quot; (Romans 8:1).</P>
				</UL>
				<P CLASS="western">In short, God's ears eagerly scan the world's
				chatter to hear someone cry &quot;Have mercy, O God!&quot;<BR>The
				second cry reminds me that God is a God of restoration. &quot;Cleanse&quot;
				(verse 7) puns on the root <I>hata'</I> (&quot;to sin&quot;) and
				its multiple appearances in the psalm. In verse 4, the voice
				confesses &quot;Against you... have I sinned&quot; (<I>hata'</I>
				basic stem), but in verse 7 it pleads &quot;Cleanse me&quot;
				(<I>hata'</I> intensive stem). The pun works like the English
				words &quot;contaminate&quot; and &quot;decontaminate.&quot; The
				biblical speaker pleads: &quot;I've sinned, so please de-sin
				me.&quot;<BR><BR>That de-sinning has huge results:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stains and
					grime are &quot;blotted out&quot; - no longer visible, and no
					longer offensive.</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grime is
					gone, replaced by vivid color - bright snow-like &quot;whiteness&quot;
					(verse 7b).</P>
					<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God need no

				<P CLASS="western"><A NAME="left1"></A>this is the first Sunday
				this year where we encounter Hebrews in the lectionary. It's a
				good idea, then, to remind ourselves about some basic issues of
				introduction.<SUP>1</SUP>&nbsp; <BR><BR>In spite of the fact that
				the King James Version ascribes Hebrews to Paul, it was almost
				certainly not written by him. Indeed, the identity of the author
				is a puzzle about which no consensus exists (this lack of
				consensus is no modern invention; it goes back to the early
				centuries of the church). <BR><BR>Hebrews seems to have been
				written sometime in the last third of the first century A.D., and
				while it is often called &quot;The Epistle to the Hebrews,&quot;
				it is not, in fact, a letter. Instead it is a sermon - its
				unknown-to-us author calls it a &quot;word of exhortation&quot;
				(13:22). <BR><BR>It looks like the author might have had a
				particular community in his sights when writing this sermon (see
				13:22-25), but it's not at all clear where that community was
				located (Palestine and Rome are the most prominent alternatives).
				What does seem clear is that the original audience had suffered
				some persecution (10:32), and some members either had or were
				considering turning their backs on the faith (see 6:4-6). This
				portrait of the original community, suffering in some way and in
				danger of wavering in their faith, may provide a point of contact
				with our own communities.<BR><BR>The Greek of Hebrews is
				particularly fine. The sentences can be long and complex with
				lots of grammatical subordination. Because English has a harder
				time than Greek in dealing with this complexity, most English
				translations are forced to obscure the complexity of the Greek by
				dividing its long sentences into shorter ones. This makes for a
				more readable translation; but it can get in the way of
				interpretation. <BR><BR>The complexity of the Greek of Hebrews
				mirrors the complexity of its argument, which is intensely
				exegetical and beautifully non-linear. In other words, it
				interprets passages from the Old Testament in sometimes thrilling
				and often mystifying ways, and its topics are treated in multiple
				places. The final effect is less like connect-the-dots and more
				like an intricate tapestry. It's important, therefore, to situate
				our passage within a larger context.<BR><BR>Hebrews 5:5-10 is the
				second half of a larger unit that begins at 4:14. This larger
				passage looks backward to passages earlier in Hebrews. It expands
				on the idea of a &quot;merciful high priest,&quot; introduced in
				2:17. And the quotation from Psalm 2:7, &quot;You are my Son,
				today I have begotten you,&quot; reprises the first Old Testament
				quote in the book (1:5). <BR><BR>In Hebrews 4:14-5:10, Christ is
				compared to the high priests from the Old Testament and shown to
				be <I>like them</I>. The high priest makes atonement for sin
				(5:1), is able to sympathize with the people because he shares
				their weaknesses (5:2-3), and becomes a high priest by being
				called by God (5:4). Christ is <I>like</I> the high priests in
				all these ways. He was appointed by God (5:5-6). He sympathizes
				with our weakness (4:15). And, presumably by making atonement
				(see Hebrews 9), he gives us access to mercy and grace from God,
				eternal salvation (4:16; 5:9). The only difference between Jesus
				and the high priests is sin. Jesus is without it (4:15) but they
				have to make atonement for their own sin (5:3).<BR><BR>The
				passage also looks forward, especially by referring to
				Melchizedek in 5:6, 10. The author of Hebrews doesn't do much
				with Melchizedek here. Indeed, the quotation of Psalm 110:4 in
				Hebrews 5:6 serves as a proof text supporting the claim that
				Jesus was appointed high priest by God and did not thrust himself
				forward on his own account. But this little seed, &quot;You are a
				priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek,&quot;
				grows out of all proportion in chapter 7 when Hebrews <I>contrasts</I>
				Jesus to the Aaronic high priesthood and finds Christ <I>superior</I>
				to Aaron. <BR><BR>But we're getting ahead of ourselves. At this
				point in the argument, Christ is more <I>like</I> the high priest
				than <I>unlike</I>. Contrasts, both to the high priest and to the
				whole system of sacrifice, will follow in later
				chapters.<BR><BR>Perhaps the most significant characteristic of
				this particular passage - and what makes it particularly apt for
				the fifth Sunday in Lent - is its emphasis on the humanity of
				Jesus. Verses 7-10 in Greek are a relative clause, a clause that
				begins with the word &quot;who.&quot; The person to whom the
				&quot;who&quot; refers is &quot;Christ&quot; in verse 5. In other
				words, verses 7-10 describe the Christ who did not glorify
				himself in becoming high priest, but was instead appointed to
				that position by God. <BR><BR>These verses are a single sentence
				in Greek (note that the NRSV has it divided into two) with two
				main verbs: &quot;learned&quot; in verse 8, and &quot;became&quot;
				in verse 9. Jesus, the eternal Son of God, &quot;learned
				obedience through what he suffered,&quot; and as a consequence
				&quot;became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey
				him.&quot; Jesus Christ, whom Christians would later call the
				Second Person of the Trinity, &quot;learned obedience through
				what he suffered!&quot; This is how God works in the world
				through Christ: not by overpowering his enemies with force and
				victory, but by suffering.<BR><BR>As Lent approaches its climax
				in Holy Week, the story of Jesus descends into suffering of the
				most intense kind: betrayal by friends, conviction by an unjust
				court, torture and execution by the cruelest of methods. Christ
				truly did learn obedience through what he suffered. And in so
				doing he &quot;became the source of eternal salvation for all who
				obey him.&quot; This is the heart of the Gospel. And the author
				of Hebrews knew it.</P>

				<P CLASS="western">Matters of life and death have a way of
				focusing one's attention. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western">It has not been long since Lazarus, still
				wrapped in grave cloths and smelling four days dead, stumbled out
				of the tomb and into the waiting arms of his sisters and friends.
				Now that life is getting back to normal (can life ever be normal
				after somebody is raised from the dead?), one might expect the
				focus to turn to the impending feast of Passover. However, even
				that greatest of festivals cannot hold a candle to the Light of
				the World, who has, after all, just brought his friend from death
				to life with only a heavenward glance and the strength of his
				voice. <BR><BR>That is precisely what troubles the Pharisees.
				They and the rest of the religious establishment are powerless
				against this Galilean man who claims to have come from the Father
				in heaven.<BR><BR>Already many of the Jews are believing in him.
				Before too long, the Pharisees fear, <I>everyone</I> will follow
				after him, causing the Romans to come and destroy their temple
				and the nation (John 11:45-48) and strip them of their authority.
				Their worst fears are confirmed when the crowds who had been at
				Lazarus' tomb begin to testify. &quot;Look,&quot; the Pharisees
				exclaim, like the representatives of a failed ad campaign, &quot;the
				world has gone after him!&quot; (John 12:19).<BR><BR><B>We want
				to see Jesus</B><BR>In our pericope the world is focused on Jesus
				to such an extent that even some Greeks - could they be among the
				sheep who are not from the fold? (10:16) - are anxious to lay
				eyes on him. They engage in a little first-century social
				networking with Philip, the disciple with the Greek name, a
				person whom Jesus had &quot;friended&quot; near the start of his
				earthly ministry (1:43). And it is no wonder they want to see
				Jesus. After all, he has been inviting folks to &quot;come and
				see&quot; from the very beginning (1:39). <BR><BR>Plus, there is
				the matter of all those signs, of which the raising of Lazarus is
				only the most recent. It is easy to imagine how seeing water
				turned to wine or a man given his sight would lead people to
				believe in and follow One who can do such things (see 4:48; 6:30;
				11:45). Seeing is believing in this Gospel (6:14, 30; 19:35;
				20:27), so when the Greeks ask to see Jesus, they are, perhaps,
				expressing their desire to believe. Whether they are successful
				in meeting Jesus we are not told, but Jesus' response to their
				query refocuses the terms of the discussion. <BR><BR>No longer is
				it enough to come and see Jesus; from &quot;this hour&quot;
				forward his followers are invited to come and <I>be</I> with
				Jesus.<BR><BR><B>Whoever serves me must follow me</B><BR>At the
				beginning of his ministry, Jesus invites his disciples to &quot;follow
				me&quot; (1:43), and he promises the &quot;light of life&quot; to
				those who do follow (8:12). However, on more than one occasion,
				he tells some of &quot;the Jews&quot; that they cannot come where
				he is going (7:34; 8:21). Later during this Passover festival, he
				says the same thing to his disciples (13:33). Nonetheless, it is
				clear that a time will come when they <I>will</I> be able to
				follow him (13:36). Indeed, he says, he will go first &quot;and
				prepare a place for you,&quot; and then &quot;come again and take
				you to myself, so that where I am, there you may also be.&quot;
				(14:3).<BR><BR>Making it possible for his followers to abide
				together with him seems to be a core purpose of Jesus' ministry,
				as he prays to God that &quot;I desire that those also, whom you
				have given me, may be with me where I am&quot; (17:24).&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<BR><BR><B>Where I am, there will my servant be also</B><BR>Where
				is Jesus? He is with the Father (1:1; 14:11), and he dwells among
				us (1:14; 14:23). He is leading his followers to eternal life as
				he moves toward the hour of his death (12:32-33). Before much
				longer he will be &quot;lifted up&quot; on the cross (12:32, 34;
				8:28) where he will lay down his life for his friends (15:13).
				Even as a grain of wheat falls to the earth in order to fulfill
				its true purpose, Jesus is lifted up from the earth in order to
				fulfill his, so that he may draw all people to himself. (12:24,
				32). It is there, at the cross, that we will see his glory
				(17:24). <BR><BR><B>The hour has come</B><BR>Following Jesus is a
				matter of life and death. Or, to put it another way, life and
				death matter to those who follow Jesus.<BR><BR>During this season
				of Lent we follow him all the way to Golgotha, all the way to the
				cross, where we will stand beneath it, together with those
				followers who asked at the beginning of his ministry, &quot;Where
				are you staying?&quot; (1:38). It is there, in the face of the
				world's many ways of death (e.g., poverty, economic collapse,
				hunger, sickness, war) that we are drawn even closer to Jesus. It
				is there, in the light of the stark reality of life at its end
				that we begin to catch a glimpse of life at its fullest. <BR><BR>Jesus
				promises, &quot;When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw
				all people to myself&quot; (12:32). It is for such a time as this
				that Jesus has brought us to this hour. There is nothing like
				impending death to focus our attention.</P>

				</TABLE>There are many stories in the Old Testament about
				covenant, from Noah and the rainbow through Abraham and Sarah and
				their many descendants (including us) to Moses and the people at
				the foot of Mt. Sinai. In this week's beautiful reading, the
				prophet Jeremiah speaks of a covenant written not in rainbow or
				stone, not external, but written deep inside, on the very hearts
				of the people.<BR><BR>Rescue and release ... restoration and
				return.... Jeremiah speaks of God's promises to the people of
				Israel while they are still in captivity, still in exile, steeped
				in loss and grief that have broken their hearts and their
				spirits, too. Jerusalem, their great city, has been destroyed and
				their conqueror Babylon has carried away their leaders to the
				far-off capital of its powerful empire. By this 31st chapter,
				Jeremiah is no longer scolding the people for their sin and their
				lack of faithfulness to God. Instead, he brings the people a new
				message from God, good news, a word of comfort and hope. God has
				had compassion on the people; God's heart has been touched by
				their suffering, and God forgives them.<BR><BR>In this time of
				exile God makes sweeping promises to the people of Israel,
				promises of restoration and return and, most importantly, of
				relationship, too. Once again, as in so many covenant stories
				before this one, God promises to be in relationship with the
				people--like God's promises to Noah, to Abraham and Sarah, and to
				Moses and the people at Sinai--God promises to be a presence with
				the people, abiding with them, and promises that they will even
				belong to each other: God says, I will be your God, and you ...
				you will be my people.<BR><BR>Even though they have broken the
				covenant God made with them back there in the desert, at Sinai
				with the Ten Commandments, God is using words like &quot;new&quot;
				and &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;covenant&quot; once again. The
				great scholar of the Old Testament, Walter Brueggemann, calls
				this the &quot;core memory&quot; of Israel about God: that God
				will do today, in this bad circumstance, what God has done in the
				past. God will give a new covenant, a new relationship, a new
				creation. God doesn't do these things merely out of some kind of
				stubborn faithfulness but out of deep, wounded love and profound
				grief that have moved God beyond anger to tender caring. It's a
				thing of the heart, really: God decides this time that the law
				will be written not on stones, on something external, but inside,
				deep inside the people, written on their hearts.<BR><BR>There's a
				thought-provoking translation question in verse 32, when either
				&quot;husband&quot; or &quot;master&quot; could be used, as in &quot;a
				covenant that they broke, though I was their husband&quot; or
				&quot;though I was their master.&quot; There have been many times
				in human history where the distinction between the two has not
				been great, but most of us resist equating the two. In any case,
				neither word defines or adequately describes God.<BR><BR><STRONG>God
				as a loving but frustrated parent</STRONG><BR><BR>It seems to me
				that the feeling of this part of the Book of Jeremiah, the Book
				of Consolation as it's called, reminds us much more of God as a
				parent. As a parent (and former child/teenager) myself, I can
				really relate to how frustrated God must have felt when the
				people kept messing up. I also understand the whole thing about
				God being really mad and then being moved suddenly and deeply to
				love and compassion when God remembers how much God loves the
				people. For example, in this same 31st chapter of Jeremiah, there
				are exquisite lines that remind us of a mother's love: &quot;Is
				Ephraim [another name for Israel] my dear son? Is he the child I
				delight in? As often as I speak against him, I still remember
				him. Therefore I am deeply moved for him; I will surely have
				mercy on him&quot; (v. 21).<BR><BR>Isn't it interesting how often
				we contrast the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New,
				with the former being harsh and punishing and angry, and the
				latter being a much &quot;kinder and gentler&quot; God? And yet,
				we've just established in this text (as in many others) that God
				has great love and compassion for the people of Israel. The
				mystery, however, is much richer, much more complex than
				that.<BR><BR><STRONG>&quot;Core testimony&quot; v.
				&quot;counter-testimony&quot;<BR></STRONG><BR>Here we are, deep
				in Lent, approaching Holy Week. Remember that &quot;core
				testimony&quot; in the Old Testament about God's love and
				faithfulness? Brueggemann says that the core testimony is in
				tension with a &quot;counter-testimony&quot; of Israel's
				abandonment, exile, loss, and suffering, suffering that they
				attribute to God's judgment on them. Core testimony,
				counter-testimony. Brueggemann says that many people think that
				Christianity has moved &quot;beyond this tension to affirm a
				complete identification of God's power with God's love&quot;; in
				other words, we're all about the kinder, gentler God who is all
				love and not so angry and unpleasant. We tend to base this claim
				on the crucifixion of Jesus, when, as he puts it, &quot;God's own
				life embraces the abandonment of broken covenant.&quot; So, we
				Christians, then, start with the God of the Old Testament who is
				compassionate and merciful and that's where we end, too, on
				Easter Sunday, with
				victory-and-new-life-and-everything-is-just-going-to-be-fine-now.
				The trouble is, if we emphasize Easter Sunday and forget about,
				or deny Good Friday, we are claiming, Brueggemann says, &quot;an
				easy victory that does not look full in the face at Friday and
				its terrible truth.&quot;<BR><BR>And so, he says, we look again.
				We see that the Good Friday/Easter Sunday experience of
				reconciliation in our Christian faith is anticipated in the Old
				Testament in these very stories of exile and return, of captivity
				and rescue and release and restoration. The people of Israel knew
				what it was to suffer, to feel abandoned, to feel lost. And they
				also knew what both suffering and healing felt like, what it felt
				like to be forgiven, what it felt like to be lost, and then
				found, what it felt like to be exiled, and what it felt like to
				come home.<BR><BR><STRONG>The same God in both Testaments</STRONG><BR><BR>What
				Brueggemann is pointing out, then, is that the core testimony,
				about God's love and mercy, and the counter-testimony, about
				abandonment and judgment, are in both the Old and the New
				Testaments. The faith of Israel and the Easter affirmation of the
				church, he says, are both grounded in the belief that the God who
				judges is the God who brings home to wellbeing. We do love to say
				that we're an Easter people, but maybe, in light of this tension
				between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, we ought to take another
				look at what lies between them, another look at Holy
				Saturday.<BR><BR>Holy Saturday is the day that gets skipped over
				in our Holy Week observances; it was the empty day, when I was
				growing up, after the sadness of Good Friday but before the joy
				of Easter Sunday. Holy Saturday has been called &quot;the longest
				of days,&quot; a day of waiting, a not-yet, in-between time that
				in many ways describes our own lives. We know about Good Friday
				and the cross, about sorrow and death. All humankind knows about
				suffering, brutality, and injustice, about tragic endings, about
				death, all of which are part of the human condition. We
				Christians also know about Easter Sunday and the promise, the
				hint of resurrection for the rest of us, because Jesus is risen
				from the dead. This &quot;Sunday experience&quot; is all about
				hope.<BR><BR>Our lives are not all about Good Friday or all about
				Easter Sunday. We know suffering and abandonment, exile and loss,
				and we face death, our own and the deaths of those we love. We
				know ourselves as sinners, and our lives as broken. Yet we also
				taste forgiveness, we taste hope, and we taste new life, we catch
				sight of it here and there, get word of it, listen and wait and
				hope. We remember that we are dust, and to dust we shall return,
				and yet we know ourselves also as bound for glory ... pain and
				hope, dying and rising again ... all humankind waiting, waiting,
				here in the unresolved, waiting ... and we understand a little
				more why faith is best described as trust.<BR><BR>Brueggemann
				thinks about all of this and finds the unresolved in the New
				Testament just as much as in the Old. He observes that, as the
				Old Testament ends with the words, &quot;Let us go up,&quot; our
				New Testament ends with the prayer, &quot;Come, Lord Jesus!&quot;
				When we remember, as Jesus commanded us to, we say, &quot;Christ
				has died, Christ is risen, and Christ will come again.&quot; Here
				we are, living our lives in that in-between, Holy
				Saturday-feeling time, the longest day indeed.<BR><STRONG><BR>Living
				in the in-between time</STRONG><BR><BR>And so we turn again to
				God, the God of both the Old Testament and the New, with our
				broken spirits and our sins, our homesickness and loneliness, our
				hunger for justice for a suffering world, our lost vision and
				lost hope, the very fabric of our hearts torn open, and we listen
				for that Stillspeaking God to address us with words of comfort
				and consolation, words of rescue and release, of restoration and
				homecoming. We are captives, in many ways, of very different
				sorts of empires today, empires of materialism, militarism, and
				greed. And yet, paradoxically, we walk in freedom, too, as people
				of a covenant written deep on our hearts; we walk in freedom in
				this in-between time, responding to the call to do justice, to
				love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God, to love God with
				our whole being and our neighbor as ourselves.<BR><BR>Jeremiah
				addresses the people's suffering with words of comfort and hope,
				not just long ago but today as well. We live in a transitional
				time, somewhere beyond &quot;post-modern&quot; but not yet called
				anything, and the times are &quot;a-changing&quot; so fast that
				we'll have moved on to another &quot;new age&quot; before this
				period has even been named. We live, they say, in uncertain
				times. But what time, we might ask, has ever been
				&quot;certain&quot;?<BR><BR>&quot;Covenant&quot; has been
				described as something that each party enters for the sake of the
				other. Not for one's own protection or rights, but for the sake
				of the other. We know that's true of God, but is it true of us?
				Parker Palmer says that the &quot;true&quot; covenant &quot;means
				the acceptance of weighty obligations to a Lord who demands that
				we 'do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.'&quot;
				The church's acceptance of this true covenant, he says, would
				&quot;serve as a channel of reconciliation in a world in love
				with divisions.... The church would proclaim not its mastery over
				the world but its servanthood--to God, to humankind, and to the
				vision of a peaceable kingdom.&quot; Would the world say that we
				are faithful partners in this covenant?<BR><BR><STRONG><IMG SRC="http://i.ucc.org/Portals/0/red%20square%208x8.gif" NAME="graphics11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 BORDER=0>

				<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>Jeremiah 31:31-34</STRONG><BR>The
				Jeremiah passage brings to a conclusion the series of reflections
				on covenants that have occupied the First Testament readings
				during the Lenten season. God&rsquo;s promise to deal with sin
				not by destroying it but by creatively transforming it&mdash;given
				to Noah, amplified in Abraham, codified by Moses, and tested in
				the wilderness&mdash;is transformed once more in Jeremiah&rsquo;s
				vision of a covenant written in faithful people&rsquo;s hearts.
				This new covenant will not be imposed on the people from without,
				but will arise spontaneously from within, grounded in an
				intuitive knowledge of God: &ldquo;No longer shall they teach one
				another, or say to each other, &lsquo;Know the LORD,&rsquo;&rdquo;
				Jeremiah foretells, &ldquo;for they shall all know me, from the
				least of them to the greatest, says the LORD.&rdquo; This new
				covenant will bring a new degree of intimacy with God: where the
				Mosaic covenant was filtered through a metaphor of God as the
				&ldquo;husband&rdquo; of the people (vs 32), the new covenant
				will bring direct relationship: &ldquo;I will be their God, and
				they shall be my people&rdquo; (vs 33). And the intimate
				knowledge of God granted in the new covenant will be moral as
				well as intellectual, a redisposition of the will as much as a
				renewal of the understanding, inasmuch as the heart-covenant will
				originate in God&rsquo;s gracious forgiveness of iniquity and
				sin. The new covenant, therefore, will complete the movement
				begun with the covenant with Noah: God&rsquo;s way of dealing
				with sin will not be destruction, but forgiveness and intimate
				relationship that will transform sinners <EM>from within</EM>
				toward greater satisfaction of God&rsquo;s aims and ideals for
				the world.</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>Psalm 51:1-12</STRONG><BR>The psalm
				selection echoes the theme of transformation-from-within sounded
				in Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecy of a new covenant. The psalmist
				acknowledges sin and separation from God: &ldquo;I know my
				transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you
				alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight&rdquo;;
				the psalmist even seems to feel such sin is not incidental, but
				is constitutive of his very being: &ldquo;Indeed, I was born
				guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.&rdquo; The only
				possible remedy for such sin is transformation from within: &ldquo;You
				desire truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my
				secret heart.&rdquo; The poem uses language of purgation and
				washing, but in the end it is more intimate images that convey
				the central meaning: &ldquo;Create in me a clean heart, O God,
				and put a new and right spirit within me... do not take your holy
				spirit from me.&rdquo; The longing for a transformed life
				expressed in the psalm serves as a devotional complement to the
				prophetic promise in the Jeremiah passage.</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>Hebrews 5:5-10</STRONG><BR>The passage
				is part of a larger section of the Letter to the Hebrews in which
				Jesus is named as the great high priest of the new covenant. It
				seems chosen for this Sunday largely in connection with the brief
				mention of Jesus&rsquo; soul being &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; in the
				Gospel. Here the &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; in Jesus&rsquo; soul is
				described as &ldquo;loud cries and tears&rdquo; with which Jesus
				&ldquo;offered up prayers and supplications&rdquo; in fulfillment
				of his priestly role. What is unique about Jesus as priest,
				according to the epistler, is that he is both priest and victim,
				both offer<EM>er</EM> and offer<EM>ing</EM>: &ldquo;When Christ
				came as a high priest of the good things that have come... he
				entered into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and
				calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal
				redemption&rdquo; (9:11-12). That means that Jesus&rsquo;
				&ldquo;suffering&rdquo; as priest is both expiatory, connected to
				his role as sacrificial victim, and exemplary, connected to his
				own intimate relationship with God as Son. Jesus suffered death
				on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice for sins, of course; but
				more importantly, in the epistler&rsquo;s view, it was through
				this suffering Jesus &ldquo;learned obedience&rdquo; and
				&ldquo;reverent submission&rdquo; and so was &ldquo;made
				perfect.&rdquo; And having been made perfect, Jesus can now
				invite into that same intimate, saving relationship with God &ldquo;all
				who obey him.&rdquo; That is, Jesus in his &ldquo;obedience&rdquo;
				and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; willingly conforms himself to God&rsquo;s
				aims for him, and in so doing provides a model that others can
				feel and follow in conforming their own lives to divine aims as
				well. This sort of &ldquo;obedience&rdquo; is not a simple
				accession to an external and heteronomous authority, such as the
				&ldquo;covenant with the ancestors&rdquo; in the Jeremiah
				passage; but this &ldquo;obedience&rdquo; is the result of
				internalizing divine aims and seeing one&rsquo;s personal aims in
				relation to them; it is a discovery of autonomy-in-relationship
				with God; it is the &ldquo;service that is perfect freedom.&rdquo;
				Jesus&rsquo; priestly service, including his self-offering in
				suffering, is therefore the exemplary fulfillment of the promise
				of the new covenant written in the heart. 
				</P>
				<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>John 12:20-33</STRONG><BR>The Gospel
				passage assigned for this day is a sort of &ldquo;hinge&rdquo;
				between the end of Lent and the beginning of Passiontide next
				week. Jesus and his disciples have come to Jerusalem for the
				Passover when some Greek-speaking Jews, also in town for the
				festival, come to Philip, himself from a Greek-speaking region,
				and ask to see Jesus. When Jesus is told of their request, he
				responds &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be
				glorified.&rdquo; We saw last week that in John&rsquo;s
				vocabulary Jesus&rsquo; being &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; includes
				both Crucifixion and Resurrection, and it is that sense of
				&ldquo;glory&rdquo; which informs Jesus&rsquo; discourse in the
				following verses. Two sayings are paired: &ldquo;Unless a grain
				of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single
				grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Those
				who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in
				this world will keep it for eternal life.&rdquo;
				Process-relational interpretation can draw some specific meanings
				from these sayings. In process thought, the universe is composed
				of moments of feeling which arise from an impulse from God, unify
				in themselves all sorts of shades and nuances of feeling derived
				from the world, become what they are, and then perish. In
				perishing, each moment yields up its particular feeling of the
				universe, so that the feeling can be felt by new moments yet to
				arise. Unless the moment perishes, it cannot bear fruit as a
				constitutive contributor to new moments. From a process
				perspective, dying-and-arising is a fact of life in the universe,
				a reflection of the way all things are and the way all things
				become. What is unique about Jesus&rsquo; passion and
				resurrection is not simply the pattern of dying-and-arising, but
				the way his <EM>whole person</EM> is taken up into that pattern,
				the way his entire self-constitution is attuned to the successive
				satisfaction of ever-richer divine aims. This utter devotion is
				the pattern of Jesus&rsquo; life, and so is the defining
				characteristic which Jesus makes available to be felt and
				followed in the self-constitution of moments of experience in the
				lives of those who follow him. That is why Jesus says: &ldquo;Whoever
				serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant
				be also.&rdquo; Although our devotion to divine aims is not so
				whole as Jesus&rsquo;, we do in fact experience perishing and
				transition in the moments of our lives, and so we can even now
				follow Jesus in the way that leads to larger life. &ldquo;Coming
				to this hour,&rdquo; being &ldquo;lifted up&rdquo; to reveal this
				mystery of dying-and-arising as a <EM>personal</EM> possibility
				for larger life in relationship with God, is the heart and
				purpose of Jesus&rsquo; mission; this is why Jesus will not pray
				&ldquo;save me from this hour,&rdquo; even though he is
				&ldquo;troubled&rdquo; by the knowledge of the suffering that
				awaits him; instead, Jesus prays that his own dying-and-arising
				will glorify God&rsquo;s name, that is, that it will be accepted
				by witnesses as the pattern of God&rsquo;s aims for the lifting
				up of all people. Today&rsquo;s Gospel passage thus serves to sum
				up the themes of Jesus&rsquo; ministry given to us in Lent, and
				to turn our attention ahead to the Passion and Resurrection
				stories of Palm Sunday and Easter.

					<P CLASS="western">In the older liturgical cycles, this Sunday
					marked the beginning of <B>Passiontide</B>. During this solemn
					period, veils of purple cloth or plain white linen were once
					placed over religious symbols that celebrated the victory of
					Christ. In many cases, even plain crosses and those with the
					image of the Crucified One on them, were also covered as the
					significance of the veiling was lost. While many parishes
					continue to veil their crosses from this weekend, contemporary
					practice treats Palm Sunday as &quot;Passion Sunday,&quot; with
					red as the liturgical color. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">As we get closer to Easter there is

					</P>
					<UL>
						<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Jeremiah 31</B> is a passage that

					<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Unless_a_grain_of_wheat_falls_..."></A>
					Unless a grain of wheat falls ... 
					</H2>
					<P CLASS="western">In keeping with the ancient observance of
					this day as the beginning of Passiontide, today's readings begin
					to focus much more directly on the imminent liturgical
					commemoration of the suffering and death of Jesus. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">GJohn treats the crucifixion as a moment of
					triumph, rather than a tragic turn of events. This will be &quot;the
					hour&quot; -- an important theme in GJohn: 2:4; 7:30; 8:20;
					12:23,27; 13:1; and 17:1. This will be the moment of victory
					since a Jesus exalted on the cross will draw everyone to
					himself. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">There is no sense here of the scandal of the
					cross, that Paul felt so strongly. Despite the presence of the
					&quot;Greeks&quot; in the episode, this is insider talk. Unlike
					Paul who knew the difficulty of seeking to sustain theological
					discourse with either Jews or Greeks when the question of Jesus'
					death was raised, GJohn seems to be talking to its own
					constituency here. We might well wonder whether they seriously
					imagined themselves in dialogue with outsiders, or whether their
					monologues and narratives are mostly for their own benefit. A
					kind of theological whistling in the dark, perhaps? 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">In a happy turn of events, even if written
					primarily for their own internal needs, GJohn has generated
					numerous expressions that have come to encapsulate core elements
					of Christian faith:

					<P CLASS="western">Another of the great Johannine word pictures
					is to be found in this passage: the seed that falls (seemingly
					dead) into the ground and then bears much fruit. This image is
					taken up in the hymn, <I>Now the Green Blade Rises</I>, by John
					M.C. Crum (1872-1958): 
					</P>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>Now the green blade rises from the buried

					<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">The saying about losing or retaining one's
					life (vs. 25) reflects traditions that are also found in the
					Synoptic Gospels: see <A HREF="http://wiki.faithfutures.org/index.php/063_Saving_Ones_Life">063
					Saving Ones Life</A>. This can be a timely reminder that while
					GJohn has a distinctive perspective on Jesus and Christianity,
					it is not entirely cut off from the early Jesus traditions. John
					may well preserve authentic snippets of Jesus' sayings even if
					they are now embedded in a longer discourse created by the
					author or his sources. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">The final part of the passage (vss. 27ff) has
					echoes of the Gethsemane prayer vigil prior to his arrest. When
					GJohn deals with the Gethsemane scene, we have a calm and
					confident Jesus reviewing his divine origins with his Father,
					and interceding for those later generations of Christians who
					would come to believe as a result of the preaching of the
					disciples. The conflicted and agonizing Jesus of the Synoptic
					Gospels has no place in GJohn, except for this episode here. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">The incident then develops as something of a
					parallel to the Baptism and Transfiguration accounts. The
					heavenly voice assures Jesus that all is well, but this time the
					witnesses are not simply John the Baptist or even the inner
					circle of Peter, James and John. Instead, there is a crowd of
					bystanders who hear the divine voice, although only Jesus is
					said to have understood its message. 
					</P>
					<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="A_New_Covenant.3F"></A>A New
					Covenant? 
					</H2>
					<P CLASS="western">The OT reading concludes the series of
					covenant passages that has been a feature of the Lenten series: 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">Lent 1: Noahic covenant between God and &quot;all
					flesh upon the earth&quot; <BR>Lent 2: Abrahamic covenant<BR>Lent
					3: Mosaic covenant from Mt Sinai<BR>Lent 4: Covenant failure:
					punishment and restoration (Numbers 21:4-9)<BR>Lent 5: The &quot;new
					covenant&quot; 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western"><BR>The idea of a &quot;new covenant&quot;
					was to be especially significant in early Christianity, and
					eventually provided the name for the Christian set of writings
					within the Bible. Our focus, however, is better directed at the
					significance of this development in the Jeremiah tradition. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">The &quot;historical Jeremiah&quot; appears
					to have lived through the implementation (and eventual failure)
					of the so-called deuteronomistic reforms that were introduced in
					the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of Josiah. For details,
					see 2 Kings 22-23. These reforms were inspired by the kind of
					traditions now found in Deuteronomy, with some scholars
					suggesting that the &quot;book of the Law&quot; found in the
					Temple during renovations to remove pagan symbols (such as the
					bronze serpent that featured in last week's readings) was more
					or less what we now have in Deut 12-26. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">In supporting the reform agenda of Josiah
					(see Jer 11:1-17), Jeremiah seems to have fallen foul of the
					rural priests such as those from his home town of Anathoth (see
					11:21-23). With the suppression of sacrifices outside the
					Temple, the rural clergy were deprived of both income and
					status. In the end the reforms failed and the southern kingdom
					was defeated by the Babylonians. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">What is especially significant about this
					passage in Jeremiah 31 is the way it assumes and transposes the
					older covenant traditions. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">Jeremiah had seen for himself that religious
					renewal was not a matter subject to official mandate, but rather
					something that had to come from within. He dreams of a time when
					the divine Torah will be inscribed on the hearts of people,
					rather than remaining an external influence. As part of that
					dream for a new kind of relationship with God and with one
					another, Jeremiah imagines a time when there is no need of
					priest or teacher, since everyone will know God directly. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">It is a measure of Jeremiah's spiritual
					stature and maturity that he could even contemplate such a
					situation. Not many religious leaders since then have been able
					to embrace that vision of an autonomous laity. The idea of a
					&quot;brokerless kingdom&quot; is central to Jesus' vision of
					the divine commonwealth, but it put him into direct conflict
					with the religious authorities of his time. That was also the
					experience of Jeremiah, whose story seems to end with him being
					abducted by a group of refugees fleeing Jerusalem for safety in
					Egypt (see Jer 43:5-7). 
					</P>
					<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Jesus_in_Hebrews:_A_priest_like_Melchizedek.3F"></A>
					Jesus in Hebrews: A priest like Melchizedek? 
					</H2>
					<P CLASS="western">Hebrews is one of the most unusual documents
					in the NT. It consciously reinterprets Jesus in terms drawn from
					Jewish Temple ritual, and describes him as a priest. This is a
					revealing development, as it shows us how far from historical
					reality early Christians were willing to move in their desire to
					explore the religious meaning of Jesus. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">More authentic Jesus traditions show him to
					have been something of a critic of the Temple and its related
					system of purity codes. He was executed partly because of his
					known criticisms of the Temple, including an ambiguous threat to
					destroy it and replace it with the &quot;true&quot; Temple
					expected to descend from heaven at the end of time. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">Rather than presenting Jesus in his true
					colors as an apocalyptic prophet critical of the Temple
					establishment, or as a charismatic holy man renowned for his
					witty sayings and his skills as a healer/exorcist, Hebrews
					portrays Jesus as the mythical Melchizedek. This figure first
					appears in the story of Abraham (Genesis 14) as a local
					(&quot;pagan&quot;) priest who accepts Abraham's offerings upon
					his safe return from a military campaign. His name occurs in
					Psalm 110, in an even more obscure reference that is then taken
					up by the author of this letter. 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">For ancient texts that mention this figure,
					see the <A HREF="http://wiki.faithfutures.org/index.php/Melchizedek">Melchizedek</A>
					page 
					</P>
					<P CLASS="western">Since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
					we now know that there was continuing speculation about this
					Melchizedek figure in Jewish priestly circles, including those
					such as the Qumran covenant community that was estranged from
					the Temple because of a dispute about calendar calculations, and
					other issues. In these circles, Melchizedek (= &quot;king of
					righteousness,&quot; or &quot;the just king&quot;) is an angel
					of light, and is sometimes opposed to an evil power known as
					Melchiresha (&quot;king of evil,&quot; or &quot;the evil king&quot;).
										</P>
					<P CLASS="western">With the insights into esoteric Jewish
					speculation provided by the Dead Sea Scrolls, we can now
					appreciate how Hebrews represents a way of developing a
					Christology that is inspired by the special interests of the
					ancient priestly circles in Jerusalem. Like Christians of other
					times and places, the writer of Hebrews has imagined Jesus in
					the guise of the things most precious to him. We all like to
					imagine Jesus as being like us.

						as the rejected and crucified Son of Man has popped up again
						and again in our lectionary readings, from Advent through Lent
						and of course, on through Holy Week when we &lsquo;celebrate&rsquo;
						the death and resurrection of Jesus. The death of Jesus is not
						a theme imposed upon the text. It permeates the text and is the
						hermeneutic by which the text gives itself to be understood. We
						cannot emphasize this enough. </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>It
						is commonplace to read the gospels through the same royal
						ideology with which we regard the gods of mythology. In this
						view, Jesus is no more than a god stretched to the &ldquo;Nth&rdquo;
						value. Jesus is stronger, mightier, more powerful and
						demonstrates that power as Judge, Jury and Executioner at the
						eschaton. Therefore, we must live in fear and have a healthy
						respect for the moral judgments of this God. </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
						gospels do not move in this direction. The first thing the
						gospels do is point us to a dying and forgiving Jesus. He is
						the one who announces the character of the Creator, a character
						so different from the gods of religion. This abba abounds in
						love, overflows with joy for his children and gives them all
						good gifts. This God, the maker of heaven and earth is, for
						Jesus, the wonderful life giving God. Sin, death and the devil
						are only his business in relation to his redemptive work on our
						behalf. In him there is no shadow of turning, in him there is
						no darkness at all. In short, God does not have a shadow side.</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>With
						apologies to our Calvinist friends, we question any notion that
						separates the revelation of the Father from the person of Jesus
						(as in the so-called extra Calvinisticum). We also note the
						problem of Luther&rsquo;s &lsquo;deus absconditus (hidden God).
						This is the derived Platonic god that has haunted Christianity
						from the second century. </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>[An
						issue that faced Luther and Calvin was the looming authority of
						Augustine and his doctrine of election. No matter which way you
						slice it, the dualism that has permeated this doctrine and its
						influence has created havoc for the Reformers and their heirs,
						indeed all in the West. Little wonder that our God feels, looks
						and acts just like all the other gods.]<BR>While there is
						certainly mystery and wonder in the Creator abba, there are no
						secrets, no hidden agendas. Everything is revealed. And what is
						revealed? That our God can kick the you know what out of the
						other gods, as in the story of Elijah and the priests of Ba&rsquo;al?
						If that is the God that Jesus reveals, then why did Jesus not
						call down legions of angels at his arrest? If this is so, why
						did God not deliver Jesus from the clutches of the angry mob
						and their rulers? If this is so, then why, when God raised
						Jesus from the dead, did Jesus not come back and smite his
						enemies? Why in the world would he appear to his disciples
						announcing &ldquo;Peace&rsquo;, the very message he announced
						before he died? No, this retaliatory god is not the abba of
						Jesus, nor the God in whom we believe.</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Some
						might say &ldquo;Jesus&rsquo; role as judge won&rsquo;t come
						until the End.&rdquo; But if Jesus is &lsquo;the same
						yesterday, today and forever,&rsquo; at what point will we
						finally realize that this &ldquo;Judge Jesus&rdquo; is as two
						faced as Janus? When will we discern that all of our
						christological and theological problems occur when we insist on
						seeing Jesus through the lens of the gods of religion rather
						than seeing the gods of religion and their violence exposed in
						the cross?</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
						are we being shown in the gospel? We are shown our own
						propensity for mimetic conflict and its resolution through
						scapegoating violence, and God&rsquo;s transformation of this
						mechanism for our salvation. Some may object and say that this
						does not speak to their situation. They&rsquo;re not violent,
						they were not there when Jesus died. These folks believe that
						they would never have harmed Jesus, they would have listened
						and obeyed. But the proof in the pudding is in the fact that we
						continue to treat others just like we would treat Jesus. We all
						have our scapegoats; people we would prefer to see removed from
						the planet. We have all tasted hate. </FONT></FONT>

						the rulers. (Those who can reasonably see themselves in the
						victim probably don&rsquo;t have internet access.) As we have
						pointed out previously, this way of reading the gospels has
						been aptly described as a &lsquo;repentant reading.&rsquo;
						(Hamerton-Kelly, The Gospel and the Sacred). Using this

					<DIV ID="historicalcultural" DIR="LTR">
						<P CLASS="western"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="historical-cultural" --><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Today
						we call upon three authors for their insights into our text. </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Is
						today&rsquo;s text a bit like the Gethsemane story of the
						Synoptics? Raymond Brown offers additional evidence for the
						historical credibility of the Fourth Gospel. Regarding this
						text Brown says, &ldquo;We need not jump to the conclusion that
						John presents us with a dismembered form of the Synoptic agony
						scene. It is quite probable that Jesus underwent an experience
						of agony in the face of death as described in the Synoptic
						scene, for this is not the type of incident the primitive
						Church would invent about its glorified master. Yet, since
						there were no witnesses to report the prayer of Jesus during
						the agony (the disciples were asleep at a distance), the
						tendency would be to fill in the skeletal framework of the
						Gethsemane scene with prayers and sayings uttered by Jesus at
						other times. Therefore, the Johannine picture where such
						prayers and sayings are scattered may actually be closer to the
						original situation than the more organized Synoptic scene.&rdquo;
						(Brown, The Gospel according to John) </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Our
						point in citing Brown is two-fold. First we believe that the
						Synoptic tradition is shaped by the apocalyptic orientation of
						the early Church. Kasemann suggests that &lsquo;apocalyptic is
						the mother of early Christianity,&rdquo; and we are inclined to
						agree (New Testament Questions for Today) But, Jesus was not
						the apocalyptist that scholarship of the last 100 years has
						tried to make him out to be. Apocalyptic is language that Jesus
						employs, but he uses it as a meta-map and is constantly out of
						step with what the general populace and the ruling authorities
						believe regarding apocalyptic events. Therefore, the Johannine
						portrait of Jesus shares much with those portraits of Jesus
						that debunk the &lsquo;apocalyptic Jesus&rsquo;, e.g., Marcus
						Borg&rsquo;s Jesus: A New Vision or Raymund Schwager&rsquo;s
						Jesus Of Nazareth: How He Understood His Life. Neither of these
						authors use the Johannine Gospel as they both write within the
						bounds of the modern critical consensus that only the Synoptics
						may be used to discern the historical Jesus. Given this, it is
						all the more important to note the conjunction between the
						portrait of Jesus in John and some contemporary work on Jesus,
						for as we have observed all along, both John and Mark share the
						same core perspective.</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>We
						do not often reflect on the experience of Jesus&rsquo;
						rejection and suffering. It will always be difficult to
						understand Jesus&rsquo; &lsquo;agony&rsquo; as long as we
						continue reading the gospel from the perspective of the one
						that persecutes, the one who lashes out. Brown&rsquo;s
						observation that Jesus had a &lsquo;real experience of agony&rsquo;
						makes simple sense. Anyone who has undergone tremendous loss
						knows the soul-searching questions that are asked during this
						time of crisis. Jesus&rsquo; response here and in the
						Synoptics, even if heavily edited and mediated through layers
						of tradition, indicates a real person struggling with real
						issues and questions.</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>With
						regard to the prayer itself, we turn to B.F. Westcott: &ldquo;If
						then the words be taken as a prayer for deliverance it is
						important to notice the exact form in which it is expressed.
						The petition is for deliverance out of and not for deliverance
						from the crisis of trial. So that the sense appears to be
						&lsquo;bring me safely out of the conflict&rsquo; (Heb 5:7),
						and not simply &lsquo;keep me from entering into it.&rsquo;
						Thus the words are the true answer to the preceding question.
						&lsquo;In whatever way it may be thy will to try me, save me
						out of the deep of affliction.&rsquo; There is complete trust
						even in the depth of sorrow. (St. John).</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Finally,
						we quote F.F. Bruce with gratitude for his insight:</FONT></FONT></P>
						<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-right: 0.79in">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In
						its final reaction to him, the world would pass judgment on
						itself and reveal its true character: who then would stand for
						him and who would be against him? But the world&rsquo;s
						judgment on Jesus, directed by the sinister spirit-ruler
						(archon) of the present order, would be overruled in a higher
						court; that spirit-ruler himself would be dislodged, for
						universal authority and judgment have been vested by the Father
						in the Son (John 3:35; 5:19-29), and the present order is about
						to be replaced by the eternal dominion of life and truth (17:2;
						18:37f). It is from the cross of Jesus that the true light
						shines brightest; men declare themselves to be sons of light or
						sons of darkness according as they come to that light or avoid
						it, and this is the &lsquo;krisis&rsquo; (cf. 3:19-21, 12:45F).
						The &lsquo;archon&rsquo; of this world is the adversary of the
						Son, but finds no accusation to bring against him (cf. 14:30).
						He is the adversary also of those who believe in the Son, but
						against his accusations they are to receive the powerful aid of
						the Paraclete, whose presence will be to them the evidence that
						&lsquo;the ruler of this world has been judged&rsquo; (16:11).
						That ruler&rsquo;s dethronement, then is effected by the death
						and resurrection of the Son and confirmed by the coming of the
						Spirit.&rdquo; (The Gospel of John)</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

						you must refrain from violence. <BR>To preach the cross of the

						satanic way, the way judged in the cross of Jesus. The death of
						Jesus did not solve any problems for the religious authorities.
						In a scant thirty years they would find their authority crushed
						by the Romans. What the death of Jesus did do was produce a
						movement that would learn to live together. And for all of
						their disagreements, they would learn to love one another and
						care for one another and in many cases, be exiled or executed
						for their faith in this anti-god (remember that the most
						leveled charge against the early Christians was that they were
						atheists).<BR>The world can no longer afford for the Church to
						hide the Gospel under a bushel. The gospels are encouraging us
						all of the time to reconsider what it is we think we have

						</FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>When
						we approach God, we do not approach a God who is distant or

						observer.&nbsp; Nor is our God remote, so far out there that
						human life, human choices, human interactions, human relations
						do not matter to her/him.&nbsp; Our God has taken on our flesh
						and blood, lived in poverty and marginalization, was killed as
						a common criminal.&nbsp; Our God knows the struggles, pains and
						heartaches as well as the joys, elations and jubilations of

						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Christ&rsquo;s
						mediatory work was not something he conjured up one day.&nbsp;
						He did not say, &ldquo;I think I will function as a high
						priest, as one who has the right to enter the presence of
						divinity and atone for sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rather he was called
						to that task by the One who sent him, thus our author cites
						Psalm 2:7 as an indication that Jesus&rsquo; priestly work was
						a vocation given him by God.&nbsp; In all he does, he does as a
						fulfillment of God&rsquo;s will not his own and this includes
						his intercession on our behalf.&nbsp; This is significant for
						it affirms that Jesus&rsquo; work for us is not to be seen as

						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>More
						so, our author alludes to the Gethsemane story as paradigmatic
						for what it meant for Jesus to experience the fullness of life
						in the fact that he did not want to die.&nbsp; Like us, he
						desired not to take the path that awaits each human.&nbsp;
						Unlike us, the text does not say he feared death (which we do,
						as those bound over to the darkness of mistrust and anxiety
						about our relation to the eternal, cf, Heb 2:14-15).&nbsp;
						Rather, death would not have been his choice.&nbsp; But it was
						either death or holy war, there was no other way out.&nbsp; He
						could have called legions of angels and brought about an
						eschatological climax to his ministry that would have played
						right into the hands of the evil one or he could take the path

						because we killed him, we wanted Jesus to die.&nbsp; He gave
						his life to us and for us.</FONT></FONT></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook L, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Our
						author concludes by saying that Jesus&rsquo; priesthood is thus
						different from the priesthood of the sacrificial system, the
						Aaronic priesthood.&nbsp; This priesthood was invested with
						life-taking, while Jesus&rsquo; priesthood was about
						life-giving (or as our author puts it &ldquo;he offered
						himself.&rdquo;).&nbsp; The writer of Hebrews avoids for the
						most part language related to the sacrificial life taking of
						another (&theta;&upsilon;&omega; &theta;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;
						and it&rsquo;s cognates) and opts for the language of

						&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&phi;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;,
						&delta;&iota;&alpha;&phi;&epsilon;&rho;&omega;).&nbsp; This
						linguistic shift is all important in this epistle for it
						underscores that while sacrificial language is used, it is used
						to subvert the sacrificial process.&nbsp; By comparing Jesus to
						Melchizedek (which is amplified in 7:1-10), our author intends
						us to understand that Jesus&rsquo; relation to the mechanism of

						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>JEREMIAH 31:31-34.</STRONG>
						Jeremiah&rsquo;s ministry from about 627 to 580 BC covered one
						of the most critical periods of Israel&rsquo;s history, just
						before the exile in Babylon. He warned of the catastrophe about
						to befall the nation because they had failed to live as God
						intended. His words were not entirely without hope. He looked
						forward to a &ldquo;new covenant&rdquo; - a relationship of the
						heart, not on stone tablets like the Law of Moses. People would
						do intuitively what God requires of them. No one would need
						instruction or an intermediary because everyone would &ldquo;know
						the Lord.&rdquo;</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>PSALM 51:1-12.</STRONG> In the same
						spirit of repentance and renewal, this psalm pleads for
						forgiveness and voices the longing of a faithful soul for a new
						relationship with God.</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>HEBREWS 5:5-10</STRONG>. &nbsp;
						Hebrews is not a letter, but a theological essay written to
						encourage Jewish Christians enduring persecution, perhaps even
						rejection by their own families. It attempts to answer whether
						it was worth holding on to their faith in Christ. The writer
						assures the faithful that Jesus understands what they are going
						through. He also suffered at the hands of his contemporaries.
						Through suffering in obedience to God, he opened the way to God
						for all. The image of Jesus as the high priest comes from the

						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>JOHN 12:20-33.</STRONG> A group of

						established. His crucifixion would draw the whole world into
						this new relationship with God.</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>A MORE COMPLETE ANALYSIS.</STRONG></P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>JEREMIAH 31:31-34.</STRONG> Jeremiah
						was a member of a priestly family from the village of Anathoth,
						a short distance north of Jerusalem. His prophetic ministry
						from about 627 to 580 BCE covered one of the most critical
						periods of Israel&rsquo;s history, just before the exile in
						Babylon. There are also five chapters of the book (40-44) which
						describe activities of the prophet after the fall of Jerusalem
						in 586 BCE. Two significant events marked the history of
						period: the break up of the great Assyrian empire and the rise
						of the Babylonian power; and the resurgence of religious
						nationalism in Judah during the reign of King Josiah,
						culminating in 621 BCE with the centralizing of worship in the
						temple in Jerusalem. After the death of Josiah in the battle of
						Megiddo (609 BCE), a succession of weak monarchs with
						anti-Babylonian policies brought about the surrender of
						Jerusalem in 597 BCE and the exile of the leaders of Judean
						society. A further anti-Babylonian revolt ended in the
						destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 587/586 BCE.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Jeremiah warned of the catastrophe about to
						befall the nation because they had failed to live as God
						intended. His words were not entirely without hope. They look
						beyond the national disaster to a new spiritual revival. This
						theme can be found especially in chapters 30-32, frequently
						referred to a &ldquo;the book of consolation.&rdquo; The
						lectionary reading consists of a prose exposition of that hope
						amid a collection of poetic oracles, some of which reflect the
						oracles of both the earlier prophet Hosea (31:1-6) and the
						Jeremiah&rsquo;s contemporary, Second Isaiah (31:10-14). 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">In this passage Jeremiah looked forward to a
						&ldquo;new covenant&rdquo; - a relationship of the heart, not
						on stone tablets like the Law of Moses. People would do
						intuitively what Yahweh requires of them. No one would need
						instruction or an intermediary because everyone would &ldquo;know
						the Lord.&rdquo; According to Jeremiah, the heart of the
						covenant forged in Sinai was an intimate, personal relationship
						with Yahweh, as close as that of husband and wife (vs. 32). For
						Jeremiah, the destruction of the temple symbolized the apostasy
						which ended the Sinai covenant. A new relationship had become
						necessary, a covenant written &ldquo;on their hearts.&rdquo;</P>
						<P CLASS="western">As with all ancient peoples, the heart was
						the seat of all psychic life, the centre of the emotions, the
						intellect, and especially, the will and moral life. Thus, for
						the Hebrews it became the point of contact with God. This
						&ldquo;innermost spring of human personality is directly open
						to God and subject to his influence,&rdquo; wrote R.C Dentan,
						professor of Old Testament at General Seminary, New York, in
						his article on the heart in <EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible
						Dictionary</EM>, (vol. 2, 550). But the heart is also prone to
						evil and isolation from God. Both Old and New Testaments
						present us with numerous passages of both response and
						rejection of spiritual realities by the human heart. The phrase
						&ldquo;hardening of the heart&rdquo; describes the drifting
						away from God so evident in the moral and spiritual decline of
						any age.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Jeremiah&rsquo;s hope for a covenant written
						on the heart has an eschatological element in that he sees it
						as a future rather than an immediate event. It will also come
						about, not by human initiative, but by God&rsquo;s grace and
						with divine forgiveness for the apostasy and sin of the past.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">&nbsp;</P>
						<P CLASS="western">&nbsp;</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>PSALM 51:1-12.</STRONG> In the same
						spirit of repentance and renewal, this psalm pleads for
						forgiveness and voices the longing of a faithful soul for a new
						relationship with God.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The superscript of the psalm relates it to
						King David when Nathan condemned him for his adulterous assault
						on Bathsheba. At best, this is a poetic attribution made long
						after the story of the sin of Israel&rsquo;s greatest romantic
						hero had become common currency. It is now believed to be the
						product of a Levitical compiler or editor of the Psalter in the
						post-exilic period. One scholarly viewpoint regards vs. 4 as
						evidence that it was not a Davidic composition because
						Bathsheba, Uriah and Joab were also sinned against by David&rsquo;s
						duplicitous actions.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The powerful message of this penitential
						psalm is by no means diminished by this exegesis. The psalmist
						pours out his guilt and shame in most memorable words. His
						sense of sin is much more profound than is found in many psalms
						of lament which express complaints against enemies and plead
						for deliverance from afflictions. Here is someone who has been
						animated by the teachings of the great prophets who denied the
						worth of animal sacrifices and emphasized a spiritual reaction
						to personal affliction. One of the most profound moral insights
						is the consciousness that sin is not only against one&rsquo;s
						fellow human beings, but against God. We have here a somewhat
						truncated attitude which does not recognize the injury to the
						former relationship, but focuses almost exclusively on the
						latter. He desperately wants to get right with God, rather than
						restore whatever human relationships his sin may have broken.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Many people find vs. 5 a problem. Careful
						analysis, however, does not cast it as acondemnation of one&rsquo;s
						parentage. The penitent, not the mother, is shamed and
						disgraced by whatever actions lie behind this vivid expression
						of sin. A similar attitude is found in Ps. 58:3 and in the
						later Jewish concept of evil inclination in the apocryphal book
						of Ecclesiasticus 15:11-15.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">On the other hand, the psalm contains a
						highly developed spiritual sense of what sin does to our
						relationship to God. The plea for a clean heart and a new and
						right spirit (vs. 10) has few equals in either testament. So
						also the prayer not to be cast out of God&rsquo;s presence or
						deprived of the spirit of holiness implores the continuation of
						the state of grace in which life must be steadfastly lived.
						Finally, the plea for restoration of a willing spirit (vs. 12)
						brings the moral implications of grace to the fore almost as
						clearly as do the Gospels and the Pauline epistles.</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>HEBREWS 5:5-10.</STRONG> This is not
						really a letter in the usual sense, but more of a theological
						sermon or essay written to encourage Jewish Christians under
						some unstated threat, perhaps persecution, or rejection by
						their own families and community. It attempts to answer whether
						or not it was worth holding on to their faith in Christ.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Scholarly debate as to who wrote this essay
						and to whom it was written persists as vigorously today as a
						century or more ago. No one can be precise in answering those
						questions, only uncertain and speculative at best. The content
						of the document, however, defines the theological relation
						between the old covenant and the new, drawing upon the Greek
						version of the Hebrew scriptures rather than any particular
						historical setting. On the basis of who the author and the
						recipients believed Jesus to be, they can strengthen their
						faith and make their witness in the face of whatever threat may
						endanger them.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The image of Jesus as the high priest in
						this passage comes from the custom of the Jewish high priest
						offering a sacrifice on the Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement,
						which renewed Israel&rsquo;s covenant with God. In the mind of
						the author, this is certainly the role which Jesus Christ
						fulfilled, not for Jews alone, but once and for all. The
						quotation in vs. 5 comes from Psalm 2:7 which the apostolic
						tradition regarded as a messianic reference. In vss. 6 and 10,
						the more obscure references to Melchizedek draw on Psalm 110:4
						and a story in Genesis 14:17-20. In the latter perciope, Abram
						in his wanderings in Canaan and conflicts with neighboring
						kingdoms received the blessing of Melchizedek, the king and
						high priest of Salem (later Jerusalem). This referred to the
						apostolic tradition that Jesus, as the Messiah/Christ was both
						king of kings and God&rsquo;s high priest. In such a role, he
						could be Lord for both Gentiles and Jews.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The significant message of this reading,
						however, is in vss. 7-9. It emphasizes both Jesus&rsquo; own
						human nature and his divine mission as the Son of God. It also
						summarizes the Passion narrative of the Gospels by recalling
						the story of Jesus&rsquo; at prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane
						in particular, his suffering and death on the cross. The author
						assumed that his audience would make the connection
						immediately. He is also saying that this showed how he
						obediently submitted himself to the will of God, and so became
						the means of our salvation. Jesus is thus both the perfect
						priest and the perfect sacrifice. What is more, as Christ, the
						Son of God, he now reigns in glory.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The passage precedes a lengthy exhortation
						to give attention to this difficult doctrine (5:11-6:20)
						because it is the foundation for their life in the world in
						very trying circumstances. As such it provides a very
						appropriate complement to the gospel reading.</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>JOHN 12:20-33.</STRONG> A group of
						Greeks came seeking Jesus. John then recorded how Jesus
						predicted his own death and resurrection, and made a deeper
						analysis of what this meant: It is God&rsquo;s way of giving
						eternal life to all who believe. Through his sacrifice, like a
						seed planted to grow and bring forth much fruit, a new
						relationship with God would be established. His crucifixion
						would become God&rsquo;s way of drawing the whole world into
						this new relationship. 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">It would not have been unusual for Greeks
						(i.e. Gentiles) to seek out Jesus in Galilee, but this meeting
						occurred in Jerusalem &ldquo;at the festival,&rdquo; one of the
						Jewish high holy days. We are not told why they asked to see
						Jesus, but many Gentiles were attracted to Judaism for its
						rigorous moral standards in an amoral civilization. As Paul
						later discovered, it was the covenant symbol of circumcision
						which made Gentiles hold back from a total commitment to the
						Jewish tradition. Writing in the 90s CE, many decades after
						Paul&rsquo;s Gentile mission, John appears to use this pericope
						as a means of including them in the Christian community based
						on faith in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, the
						Christ/Messiah for all of humanity, not for Jews alone.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Throughout his gospel narrative, John has
						Jesus use the word &ldquo;glorify&rdquo; in reference not only
						to his death but also to his resurrection. Perhaps by the end
						of the 1st century early Christian art had already begun to
						portray the crucifixion in more attractive ways than it must
						have been experienced. Or perhaps knowledge of the resurrection
						had already caused the dark horror of that scene to have
						diminished before the brightness of faith in the risen Lord.
						The tradition of the seed that dies to give new life (vs. 24)
						obviously had been a strong apostolic tradition because Paul
						hadalso used it in his letter to the Corinthians, as had Jesus
						in his parable of the seed and sower. Here John tied it to
						Jesus&rsquo; teaching about service also found in the other
						gospels.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">More difficult to understand, however, are
						the subsequent words John attributed to Jesus. One commentary
						gives this pericope the title of &ldquo;The Agony and the
						Voice.&rdquo; (W.F. Howard. <EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible</EM>,
						vol. 8, 664). Howard also notes that this passage in John
						replaces the synoptic narrative of the agony in Gethsemane, but
						closely resembles Mark 14:33-35. The voice of reassurance (vs.
						28) is similar to the voice in Mark 9:7 at the Transfiguration.
						Three different interpretations are given to the voice: by some
						of the disbelievers in the crowd who thought they had heard
						thunder. Others said it was an angel, possibly recalling two
						stories from Genesis 21:17 and 22:11 when God spoke to Hagar
						and Abraham in crucial situations.. The final word, however,
						came from Jesus. The hour of crisis had come when people must
						decide between walking in the light or the darkness
						(vss.35-36). For some reason the reading excludes this
						interpretation.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">This whole passage focuses on the meaning
						and cost of discipleship. Without ever naming the crucifixion,
						it holds up the cross as the symbol of the sacrifice that
						discipleship entails. More than likely John wrote for a Gentile
						audience, so he used commonly recognizable metaphors such as a
						fruitful seed of wheat and contrasting light and darkness to
						explain in a positive manner, just what any Christian might
						expect in making such a commitment at the end of the 1st
						century. In commonwith the other gospels, he wove into this
						pericope elements of the apostolic tradition of the words Jesus
						himself had used. John also tied these to his theme of the
						mighty works of Jesus glorifying God. The effect is to lift the
						whole experience of discipleship from the ordinary mundane
						level of suffering and sacrifice to the sanctified holiness of
						accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</P>

						Elves&rsquo;</B></A> review of Orthodox Christian belief
						leading to Palm Sunday, Holy Week, and the celebration of
						Easter. Jesus&rsquo;s last public dialogue in John&rsquo;s
						Gospel is confirmed, or explained, in the portion plucked from
						the anonymous letter to the &ldquo;Hebrews.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s
						Jesus says, &ldquo;Whoever serves me must follow me, for
						wherever I am, my servant must be there also . . . if I&rsquo;m
						elevated from the earth, I&rsquo;ll take everyone with me.&rdquo;
						Whoever wrote the letter to the &ldquo;Hebrew&rdquo; community
						in Rome says, &ldquo;he [Jesus] became the source of eternal
						salvation for all who obey him . . .&rdquo; This leader&rsquo;s
						interpretation of Jesus&rsquo;s death and resurrection is that
						Jesus did not claim the power and the glory of high-priesthood.
						That was bestowed upon him by God himself &ndash; just like it
						was bestowed upon Melchizedek.<BR><BR>Both the Gospel of John
						and the Letter to the Hebrews are products of the leadership of
						communities in the late 1st to early 2nd Centuries who were
						struggling with the developing legend surrounding the death of
						Jesus. John&rsquo;s community may have been more involved with
						the separation from Judaism of followers of the emerging
						Christian way. Depending on the timing of the Gospel, John&rsquo;s
						community may also have been dealing with a double whammy: not
						only were they separating from traditional Judaism; traditional
						Judaism was also redefining itself without the stabilizing
						influence of the Temple in Jerusalem. The recipients of the
						letter to the Hebrews were more likely to have been dealing
						with persecution on the part of Romans of the emerging
						Christian religion.<BR><BR>The subject matter in the letter to
						the Hebrews might seem to be similar to the situation Jeremiah
						was writing about: Both were addressed to communities on the
						edge of exile, who were in danger of unraveling and giving up
						on God&rsquo;s rule (Jews in destroyed 6th Century b.c.e.
						Jerusalem), or the promise of Jesus&rsquo;s return (persecuted
						Christians in 1st Century Rome). The similarities end there.
						The writer of Hebrews was enamored with the legend of the
						mysterious high priest Melchizidek, who (so far as scholars
						have been able to discover) had no parents, and never died. His
						only claim to legitimacy appears to be that he was not from the
						lineage of Aaron &ndash; who constructed the golden calf,
						thereby being the first to break God&rsquo;s Covenant with
						Moses. Once more, anti-Semitism appears like a faint watermark
						behind the printed words.<BR><BR>It seems a mighty stretch of
						imagination to pick an obscure reference from <A HREF="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=105008463"><B>Genesis
						14:18 and Psalm 110:4 </B></A>upon which to hang an argument
						about the divinity of Jesus as the Christ. But of such is
						orthodoxy often made. We will get to do it again in October for
						Proper 24.<BR><BR>The only scripture worth taking seriously in
						this group of readings is Jeremiah 31:31-34: &ldquo;The New
						Covenant.&rdquo; Of course the prophet Jeremiah, left behind in
						Jerusalem while most of the Jewish population was exiled to
						Babylon in the 6th Century b.c.e., was not talking about Jesus
						&ndash; who was born 600 or so years later. He was talking
						about a new Covenant with God that would be honored by
						faithfulness to God&rsquo;s justice on the part of the people.
						The &ldquo;new covenant&rdquo; would not depend on Temple
						worship, but on individual response to God&rsquo;s law. &ldquo;I
						will put my law within them,&rdquo; Jeremiah reports, &ldquo;and
						I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and
						they shall be my people.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jeremiah was not worried
						about orthodox rules for worship. Nor was he talking about some
						god-like priest-king who came from nowhere and lives forever as
						high priest to an amalgamation of the Canaanite deity El Elyon
						and Yahweh (&ldquo;the order of Melchizedek&rdquo;). Jeremiah
						was trying to assure that Judaism would survive. That could
						only happen if each individual person were to take on the
						responsibility to act in accordance with God&rsquo;s law. The
						Psalm Jeremiah would sing is Psalm 119: &ldquo;I treasure the
						word in my heart, so that I may not sin against you. . . . I
						delight in the way of your decrees as much as in all riches. .
						. . I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your
						word.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jeremiah&rsquo;s situation may have been
						similar to Third Millennium Christianity, which <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Christianity-Must-Change-Die/dp/0060675365"><B>John
						Shelby Spong</B></A> suggests will have to either change or
						die. Should exiles from Christian Orthodoxy reclaim the myth of
						a dying-rising god for a post-modern world? Or does sustainable
						life on 21st Century Planet Earth depend more on teasing out
						the story of Jesus&rsquo;s life and teachings from two
						millennia of misquotation and misinterpretation?<BR><BR>From
						inside his own Jewish tradition, Jesus taught that the law of
						the Universe (God&rsquo;s law) is distributive
						justice-compassion. God&rsquo;s law (the rules of the universal
						order) shows no partiality. The rain falls on the just and the
						unjust. The sun shines, the winds blow, the earth turns.
						Because human consciousness can choose to live outside the
						realm of distributive justice-compassion, Jesus also taught a
						radical abandonment of self-interest (&ldquo;Love your
						enemies.&rdquo;) Instead of unjust systems bringing war,
						famine, disease, and death (Empire), humans can choose
						non-violence, justice-compassion, and peace (Covenant). The
						downside, as Jews and Gentiles alike have learned through
						experience, is that choosing Covenant often gets people
						killed.<BR><BR>John&rsquo;s Jesus says, &ldquo;Those who love
						their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world
						will keep it for eternal life.&rdquo; Some Christians have
						interpreted this to mean not only salvation from hell in the
						next life, but indifference to injustice in this life. &ldquo;I
						know I&rsquo;m going to heaven because I believe in Jesus,&rdquo;
						a co-worker once told me. &ldquo;Why should I care what happens
						to anyone else?&rdquo; I submit that this is the kind of
						Christian who long ago abandoned Jesus to his fate. As the
						writer of Matthew&rsquo;s gospel suggests in his apocalyptic
						description of <A HREF="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=105008529"><B>the
						final judgment</B></A>, the ones who will inherit the kingdom
						of God are the ones who feed the hungry, clothe the naked,
						extend hospitality to the stranger, visit prisoners &ndash; in
						short, those who abandon their own self-interest in the service
						of justice-compassion. These are the ones who accompany Jesus
						on his final walk to crucifixion and death. These are the ones
						in whom and with whom Jesus rises into incarnation.<BR><BR><B><A HREF="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=105008584">Luke&rsquo;s
						version</A> </B>of the saying does not include allusions to
						&ldquo;life in this world&rdquo; versus &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo;
						Luke&rsquo;s Jesus says, &ldquo;Whoever tries to hang on to
						life will forfeit it, but whoever forfeits life will preserve
						it.&rdquo; When the Orthodox Christian interpretive gloss is
						removed, the conundrum that contains the truth is revealed. In
						the context of Jesus&rsquo;s life and death, and prophetic
						Jewish tradition, in the service of distributive
						justice-compassion, whoever hangs onto life under the rules of
						Empire will end up selling out to the systems of injustice.
						King Saul comes to mind. Even the great King David learned that
						lesson the hard way. So did <A HREF="http://www.gaiarising.org/blog.3.25.07.html"><B>Judas</B></A>.
						But whoever gives up the safety of imperial control lives
						already in God&rsquo;s realm of distributive
						justice-compassion.<BR><BR>Jeremiah&rsquo;s task was to
						convince the people that what mattered to the God of Abraham,
						Isaac, and Jacob was justice. Under Jeremiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;new
						covenant,&rdquo; wherever they happened to be, and under
						whatever conditions, if the people lived in accordance with
						God&rsquo;s justice, God would restore them to the land, and
						with it, the Temple. For post-modern, 21st Century exiles from
						Christian orthodoxy, whenever anyone radically abandons
						self-interest in the service of distributive
						justice-compassion, the &ldquo;new covenant&rdquo; is
						established; a <A HREF="http://www.gaiarising.org/holyweek2007.html"><I><B>kenotic

						is no need for a &ldquo;high priest on the order of

						One could almost call this Sunday&rsquo;s Gospel lesson, &ldquo;The
						Last Temptation of Christ&rdquo;!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Pharisees, in John 12:19
						say to each other, &ldquo;You see, we can do nothing!&nbsp; The
						whole world has gone after him!&rdquo;&nbsp; That statement of
						intense frustration by those who would stifle Jesus&rsquo;
						popularity would be literally fulfilled in the Gospel lesson
						for the lectionary for this Sunday &ndash; Passion Sunday.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This lesson begins with the
						words, &ldquo;Now among those who went up to worship at the
						festival were some Greeks.&nbsp; They came to Philip, who was
						from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, we wish
						to see Jesus&rdquo; (12:20-21)&rdquo;.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Greek word here translated
						&ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; is crucial to the understanding of the
						import of this story.&nbsp; It is the Greek word that should be
						best translated &ldquo;Gentile&rdquo;.&nbsp; It is <I>not </I>the
						Greek word for Jews who spoke Greek or lived in Gentile
						countries, nor does the world mean Greeks who were Jewish
						proselytes.&nbsp; It means &ldquo;pagans&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo;
						&ndash; those outside the influence of the Promised People, and
						therefore in the eyes of the Judeans of that day, those
						rejected by God.&nbsp; These &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; presumably
						have not come to Jerusalem to participate in the Passover
						festival, but specifically and intentionally to meet with &ldquo;the
						Son of Man&rdquo;.&nbsp; Thus, it is these &ldquo;non-Jewish
						Gentiles&rdquo; who come to Philip and ask to speak with
						Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is intriguing to note that
						the two disciples to whom they go to gain entry to Jesus have
						Greek names &ndash; Philip and Andrew.&nbsp; Did these Greeks
						feel they would make more headway by going to apparently
						Greek-influenced disciples?&nbsp; We do not know.&nbsp; But the
						very placing of this story at this point in the Johannine
						narrative serves to illustrate clearly the truth of the
						Pharisees&rsquo; comment, &ldquo;Look, the whole <I>world</I>
						has gone after him&rdquo;, for now even non-Jewish Gentiles are
						seeking Jesus out!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The text does not tell us
						whether or not these Gentiles got to see Jesus!&nbsp; But what
						did happen was a response by Jesus to their request, brought to
						him by Andrew and Philip &ndash; a response that seems
						thoroughly inappropriate!&nbsp; To their request that he visit
						with these Gentiles, Jesus responds:</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;The hour has come for
						the Son of Man to be glorified.&nbsp; Very truly, I tell you,
						unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it
						remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much
						fruit.&nbsp; Those who love their life lose it, and those who
						hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.&nbsp;
						Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my
						servant be also.&nbsp; Whoever serves me, the Father with
						honor&rdquo; (12:23b-26).</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This is a strange response to
						a simple request by Gentiles to speak to Jesus!&nbsp; But if
						one puts this story in the larger context, then one can being
						to perceive Jesus&rsquo; anxiety and his consequent reaction.&nbsp;
												</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>These Gentiles were coming to
						ask Jesus to leave the dangers of Jerusalem and the coming
						inevitable final confrontation with the Jerusalem clergy
						aristocracy.&nbsp; Rather, they wanted Jesus to return with
						them into Gentile territory beyond Judean influence or
						authority.&nbsp; There, Jesus could be safe, and would be free
						and even welcomed to teach and heal as he so obviously felt
						led.&nbsp; It is intriguing that the synoptic gospels&rsquo;
						report that Jesus spent significant time (some would estimate
						around one-third of his time) in Gentile territory beyond the
						borders of Galilee.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thus, in these Gentiles&rsquo;
						offer lay the way out of the death that would otherwise
						inevitably await Jesus if he continued his attack of the
						Judeans &ndash; and that, quite soon!&nbsp; Should he accept
						the offer?&nbsp; Would he accept the offer?&nbsp; Could he not
						now &ldquo;save face&rdquo; while rapidly de-escalating his
						conflict with the Jewish clerical aristocracy, doing so by
						accepting the request of a people who wanted him to teach and
						heal in their country and were open to having their society
						shaped into the kingdom of God?&nbsp; It must have been
						terribly, terribly tempting &ndash; especially to a young man
						who really was dreading the thought of dying (cf. Luke
						22:41-46).&nbsp; It was, in reality, the last temptation of
						Christ!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jesus rejects their offer of
						escape.&nbsp; Using the metaphor of wheat, Jesus states that it
						is only through his dying that humanity will live.&nbsp; It is
						only through his crucifixion that those committed to him will
						be birthed into a new community.&nbsp; If he becomes fixated
						upon preserving his life, Jesus observes, then all will be lost
						&ndash; the kingdom, the world, humanity &ndash; and even his
						own soul.&nbsp; On the other hand, if he is willing to face
						into his own death, then all humanity will be redeemed.&nbsp;
						This is Jesus&rsquo; answer to his last temptation.&nbsp; To
						take the easy way out would be to be disobedient to that
						heavenly vision and call that God had given to him, not just at
						the beginning of his ministry, but at the very beginning of
						time (John 1:1-14).</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is at this point that Jesus
						then utters one of the most poignant lines that appear in
						scripture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now my soul is troubled.&nbsp; And what
						shall I say &ndash; &lsquo;Father, save me from this hour&rsquo;?&nbsp;
						No, it is for this very reason that I have come to this hour.&nbsp;
						Father, glorify your name!&rdquo; (12:27).</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This is one of the few places
						in John when you truly see into the inner anguish of the man
						himself.&nbsp; Here you see Jesus in the very raw!&nbsp; He is
						a young man &ndash; 33 years old.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t want
						to die!&nbsp; He wants to go on living, serving others,
						building a community, healing the broken, making humanity new
						again.&nbsp; Here is the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; With all
						his heart, he wants to cry out, &ldquo;Father, save me from

						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But he will not utter such a
						cry.&nbsp; Jesus will stay the course.&nbsp; He will play out
						the drama that lies before him.&nbsp; HE <I>MUST</I> DIE!&nbsp;
						For unless he dies, there is to be no redemption of humanity.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So Jesus makes the decision to
						stay in unyielding confrontation with the political, economic
						and religious powers of both Israel and of Rome until they do
						their worst and destroy him.&nbsp; To die is his purpose in
						life.&nbsp; So he calls upon God to sustain him in what he must
						now do.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The text tells us that God
						responds verbally to Jesus.&nbsp; Some can&rsquo;t perceive the
						words.&nbsp; But Jesus can.&nbsp; And Jesus now knows that God
						reassures him that God will see Jesus through what Jesus must
						do!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jesus then turns to the crowd
						and says something utterly stunning.&nbsp; &ldquo;This voice
						has come for your sake, not for mine.&nbsp; Now is the judgment
						of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.&nbsp;
						And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people
						to myself&rdquo; (as: 30-32).</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jesus&rsquo; death, he is
						saying, will drive out &ldquo;the ruler of this world&rdquo;.&nbsp;
						The conventional interpretation today of the phrase &ldquo;ruler
						of the world&rdquo; is that this is a reference to Satan.&nbsp;
						However, that must be seriously questioned.&nbsp; First, the
						term &ldquo;ruler of this world&rdquo; as a reference to Satan
						is never used in the rabbinical literature contemporaneous with
						Jesus, nor would that term ever be used by first century rabbis
						for Satan &ndash; precisely because they believed with all
						their being that <I>Yahweh</I> was the ruler of the world!&nbsp;
						Second, it is not used in the Gospel of John as a reference for
						Satan; indeed, the only other places it occurs (John 3:1, 7:26,
						48; 14:30), it is clearly a reference to someone other than
						Satan.&nbsp; Third, for this to be a reference to Satan would
						alter the whole meaning and thrust of John 11:1&mdash;12:50,
						which pits the struggle as not between God and Satan, but
						between Jesus and the Judeans.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So who is the &ldquo;ruler of
						this world&rdquo;?&nbsp; It is the Jewish religious aristocracy
						&ndash; the consistent usage of the world &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;
						throughout the Gospel of John (3:1; 7:26, 48; 14:30).&nbsp; It
						is the Sanhedrin &ndash; the Jewish &ldquo;congress&rdquo; of
						priests, Pharisees and Sadducees -- who have done everything
						possible to &ldquo;drive out&rdquo; Jesus and his community of
						faith.&nbsp; So they will be judged by the Lord of history, and
						will therefore discover that it is, instead, they who will be
						&ldquo;driven out&rdquo;.&nbsp; Jesus, on the other hand, will
						be &ldquo;lifted up from the earth&rdquo; (i.e., will be
						crucified), and thus, by dying on behalf of the world, &ldquo;will
						draw all people to myself&rdquo;!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Consequently, it comes down to
						an eternal choice, Jesus says.&nbsp; The choice is not simply
						between whether Jesus will take the &ldquo;easy way out&rdquo;
						or to act out his obedience to a God who calls him to a cross.&nbsp;
						The choice is ours, as well.&nbsp; Jesus says, &ldquo;If you
						walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going.&nbsp;
						While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may
						become children of light&rdquo; (12:35b-36).</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Each person can choose
						darkness or light, the ruler of this world or Jesus.&nbsp; The
						choice is before you &ndash; to continue to be a part of the
						present division of power which will oppress, exploit and seek
						to control you (but, because you are use to it, seems most
						secure and stable) or to become a part of the &ldquo;beloved
						community&rdquo; of the Crucified One who is in society to
						return it to God&rsquo;s intentions for society?&nbsp; The
						choice is now before Israel, just as it was placed before them
						by Moses in the book of the Hebrew Bible which best presented
						that vision of God&rsquo;s intentions for human society: &ldquo;See,
						I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and
						adversity. . . . Choose life, so that you and your descendants
						may live, loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding
						fast to him&rdquo; (Deut. 30:15, 19b-20a). 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>And the choice is before each
						of us this Passion Sunday, as well.&nbsp; Do we follow the
						&ldquo;ruler of this world&rdquo;?&nbsp; Do we embrace their
						political, economic and ethical values of lust for control,
						oppression, greed and exploitation, of domination and of
						control?&nbsp; Do we embrace the temptation to &ldquo;take the
						easy way out&rdquo; in order to live in security, stability and
						apparent peace, in order to do the teaching and healing we so
						love to do?&nbsp; Or do we choose to join with the Christ and
						his beloved community to obediently work for God&rsquo;s
						intentions for humanity, even if that means receiving the wrath
						of those &ldquo;rulers of the world&rdquo;?&nbsp; You see, it
						is our Passion Sunday, as well! 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Jeremiah 31:31-34</B></U>
						is the prophet&rsquo;s magnificent prophecy, &ldquo;The days
						are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with
						the house of Israel and the house of Judah.&nbsp; It will not
						be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I
						took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt &ndash;
						a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says
						the Lord.&nbsp; But this is the covenant that I will make with
						the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put
						my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I
						will be their God, and they shall be my people.&nbsp; No longer
						shall they teach one another, or say to each other, &ldquo;Know
						the Lord&rdquo;, for they shall all know me, from the least of
						them to the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their
						iniquity, and remember their sin no more&rdquo;.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This passage of scripture is
						often interpreted by Christians to be a prediction by Jeremiah
						of God&rsquo;s intentions to replace God&rsquo;s covenant with
						Israel with a covenant with a people who would take Israel&rsquo;s
						place &ndash; the Christian church.&nbsp; The author of the
						Gospel of John argues that Jesus had come to create God&rsquo;s
						society through the beloved community, made necessary by the
						obvious failure of the &ldquo;Judeans&rdquo; to do so.&nbsp;
						But it is difficult to argue that this was what Jeremiah had in
						mind when he wrote this famous prophecy.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>When one reads this passage in
						its full context, it is obvious that what Jeremiah intends to
						communicate is that God will act to bring about a renewed
						relationship between Israel and God&rsquo;s Self.&nbsp; God
						will do so by creating a new covenant with Israel that will be
						different than the one made on Mount Sinai (Exod. 19&mdash;Numbers
						11).&nbsp; That will occur, not because the original covenant
						was inadequate or wrong, but because Israel had refused to obey
						it.&nbsp; And they had refused to obey it because their natural
						(i.e., sinful) inclination was to lust for power rather than
						for justice, to build their own fortunes rather than to
						equitably share their wealth, and to seek their own good rather
						than to yearn after relationship with God.&nbsp; Therefore,
						what God is about to do, Jeremiah proclaimed, is that he will
						begin a profound work in the hearts of the people of Israel so
						that, more than anything else, they would want to &ldquo;know
						the Lord&rdquo; and thus live in a way most conducive to
						fostering that relationship (that is, with political justice
						and an equitable distribution of wealth, so that humanity&rsquo;s
						need to dominate and to hoard would be eliminated).&nbsp; It is
						Israel&rsquo;s sins that caused the nation to collapse.&nbsp;
						But it will be God&rsquo;s forgiveness that will restore them
						back to the shalom of God and of each other.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The true importance of this
						passage, however, is not simply in its prophecy of a coming new
						covenant, but of Jeremiah&rsquo;s perception that God&rsquo;s
						work is always in the &ldquo;not-yet&rdquo;.&nbsp; Walter
						Brueggemann makes an excellent distinction between the division
						of the world into &ldquo;kings&rdquo; and &ldquo;prophets&rdquo;,
						&ldquo;technicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;poets&rdquo;.<!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><A HREF="http://www.piut.org/lent5B.htm#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>[1]<!--[endif]--></FONT></FONT></A>&nbsp;
						Kings and technicians are concerned with what is, with the
						management and control of the resources of life and even of
						life itself.&nbsp; Prophets and poets, on the other hand,
						center their lives in the conviction that &ldquo;something
						enormous is about to break in on us&rdquo; and thus create

						With my whole heart I seek you; do not let me stray from your

						may not sin against you&rdquo; (vss. 9-11). 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Psalm 119 is both the longest
						psalm in the Hebrew Psalter and a psalm that honors and
						celebrates the Law of Moses.&nbsp; The author of the Psalm
						obviously wants to make God&rsquo;s Law the governing and
						shaping influence upon his life.&nbsp; The psalm is an acrostic
						with each of its sections beginning with a Hebrew letter.&nbsp;
						Thus, it is divided into 22 stanzas (the number of letters in
						the Hebrew alphabet), with each stanza being eight verses.&nbsp;
						The stanza that makes up today&rsquo;s Psalter lesson begins
						with the letter <I>bet</I> (or &ldquo;B&rdquo;).&nbsp; 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The key to the understanding
						of this stanza is verse 11: &ldquo;I treasure your word in my
						heart, so that I may not sin against you&rdquo;.&nbsp; The
						Hebrew word translated &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; actually means
						&ldquo;hide&rdquo; or &ldquo;store up&rdquo;.&nbsp; Literally,
						in translation from the Hebrew, it reads &ldquo;The
						commandments from his lips &ndash; I have certainly not veered
						from them; in my bosom I have treasured the words from his
						mouth&rdquo;.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In other words, the author is
						saying that, if we are to live a truly fulfilled and rich life,
						we ought to immerse ourselves in the study and devotion of
						scripture (the Law).&nbsp; We are to commit it to memory, to
						submerge our psyche in it, to make it our necessary food and
						drink.&nbsp; We are to treasure it (vs. 11), to learn from it
						(vs. 12), to teach it (vs. 13), to delight in it (vs. 14), to
						meditate upon it (vs. 15), and to never allow ourselves to
						forget it (vs. 16).&nbsp; If we so inundate and submerge
						ourselves in the scriptures, so that it becomes bone of our
						bone and flesh or our flesh, then we will keep our way pure, we
						will center our heart upon Yahweh and we will not stray from

												</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><U><B>Hebrews 5:5-10</B></U>
						is the closely reasoned argument by this unknown Christian
						author that examines what it was about Jesus&rsquo; death that
						made it redemptive.&nbsp; He begins by presenting an argument
						from the Hebrew Bible that supports his contention that Jesus
						was appointed by God to be the world&rsquo;s high priest.&nbsp;
						The author of Hebrews quotes Psalm 2:7 (&ldquo;You are my Son,
						today I have begotten you&rdquo;) and 110:4 (&ldquo;You are a
						priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek&rdquo;).&nbsp;
						The introduction of the figure of Melchizedek is crucial to the
						author&rsquo;s argument.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Melchizedek is mentioned only
						in Genesis 14:18-20 and Psalm 110 in the Hebrew Bible, and only
						in Hebrews (5:6, 10; 6:20; 7:1, 10-11, 15, 17) in the New
						Testament.&nbsp; He was the king of Salem (the predecessor city
						to Jerusalem) in Genesis as well as a &ldquo;priest of God Most
						High&rdquo; (Gen. 14:18b).&nbsp; His importance is emphasized
						by the fact that Abram (later, changed to Abraham) submits
						himself to the authority of Melchizedek and does obeisance &ndash;
						something Abram&rsquo;s status requires of no other monarch he
						meets!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Why is Melchizedek so
						honored?&nbsp; Psalm 110 presents the argument that Melchizedek
						is both the ideal king who is superior even to David, and the
						ideal priest who mediates directly between God&rsquo;s people
						and God (I Kings 8; Ps. 132:9-10).&nbsp; That priesthood is
						eternal (Ps. 110:4a), and therefore transcends both the Aaronic
						and Levitical priesthoods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being both the king of
						justice and of shalom and as an eternal priest, Melchizedek is
						the best &ldquo;type&rdquo; of the Son of God &ndash; whose
						royal, holy, high priesthood transcends all other political,
						economic and religious orders!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>That is precisely the argument
						the author of Hebrews builds in this passage.&nbsp; Jesus, that
						author argues, is God&rsquo;s eternal high priest as typified
						in Melchizedek.&nbsp; Jesus is the divine king greater than
						David, God&rsquo;s son who, by being God&rsquo;s son, is
						qualified both to be the high priest who makes the sacrifice
						for sin and at the same time the sacrifice itself that will
						atone for the sins of Israel and of the world.&nbsp; 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But how does Jesus make
						atonement for the world&rsquo;s sins?&nbsp; He does so, Hebrews
						states, through his suffering.&nbsp; He prayed fervently for
						deliverance from death (cf. John 20:27) because, as an
						authentic human being, he no more sought death than any of us
						world.&nbsp; He &ldquo;offered up prayers and supplications,
						with loud cries and tears&rdquo; (5:7).&nbsp; His prayer was
						answered by God, not by his avoiding of death but through his
						resurrection from the dead!</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The author of Hebrews then
						moves on to an intriguing wordplay with which he identifies the
						redemptive element in Christ&rsquo;s sacrificial death.&nbsp;
						He writes, &ldquo;Although he was a Son, Jesus learned
						obedience through what he suffered&rdquo; (5:8).&nbsp; The
						Greek word translated &ldquo;learned&rdquo; is <I>emathen</I>
						and the word &ldquo;suffered&rdquo; is <I>epathen</I>.&nbsp;
						Jesus&rsquo; <I>learned </I>obedience (his natural inclination
						as a human was to survive; he had to <I>learn </I>to obey God&rsquo;s
						call to him against all logic and survival instincts) cancelled
						the disobedience of Adam (who represents the entire human race,
						Rom. 5:19) and thus qualifies Jesus to act as God&rsquo;s
						eternal high priest (Heb. 2:17; 4:15).&nbsp; It was his
						obedience (cf. John 12) that actually brought about the
						atonement of humanity because, through that learned obedience,
						he fulfilled God&rsquo;s redemptive plan for humanity.&nbsp;
						Thus, &ldquo;he became the source of eternal salvation for all
						who obey him&rdquo; (5:9) by being in his actions and
						obedience, &ldquo;a high priest according to the order of
						Melchizedek&rdquo; (vs. 10).&nbsp; That was the significance of
						what Jesus did when he decided to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo;
						in John 12:20-33.&nbsp;

						<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="rdg1"></A>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 'hour' is a biblical term which is
						repeatedly mentioned in John's gospel. John's gospel is a long
						and profound meditation on 'the hour' written as a drama in
						which everything is oriented to the final outcome - the
						encounter of the power of Jesus, based on love with the unjust
						power rejecting Him. <BR>The drama ends on the cross and
						finally in the victory over the cross and death - the
						resurrection.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">&nbsp;</P>
						<H2 CLASS="western"><!--The Readings-->the first reading:</H2>
						<P CLASS="western">The prophet Jeremiah looked toward a new
						community reconciled to God. The new community will &quot;know
						God&quot; and will lead lives completely attuned to God's
						intentions as voiced in the Torah.<BR>They are fully and
						completely forgiven - a community no longer immobilised by the
						residue of their past failure to obey!</P>
						<H2 CLASS="western"><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b024lent5rdg1.html">JEREMIAH
						31 : 31 - 34</A></H2>
						<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="psalm"></A>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hebrew scriptures do not reflect much
						upon any 'perfect' or 'finished' community. But Jeremiah, who
						could speak so poignantly about the judgement and end of old
						Israel (Jr.4:19-26 &amp; 7:27-34), anticipates a people fully
						turned to YHWH in a glad, joyous communion; &quot;Now I shall
						watch over them to build and to plant,YHWH declares&quot;
						(Jr.31:32b NJB).<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremiah speaks about
						YHWH's new age. This is not talk about any institutional
						community structure, bureaucracy, hierarchy or ideology. The
						reference is to a community as a slice of humanity that is
						committed to and participates in God's resolve for a new
						world.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The newness does not depend upon
						old Israel - but it includes it (J.31:31-32). And the new
						covenant community will be characterised by a full inner
						obedience to the Torah (Jr.31:33) and a new attitude of utter
						forgiveness towards each other within the community, made
						possible by YHWH's first having mercy on them (Jr.31:34).<BR>&nbsp;
						&nbsp; &nbsp;The text affirms and anticipates that God has in
						mind and in heart, a new economy of heaven and Earth. The new
						heaven and Earth will be quite unlike the present! It is a
						future economy that is neither mortgaged to the present, nor
						derived from the present.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is an
						intellectual scandal for modernists who believe that there will
						be no new pieces of reality given, and believe that there will
						be no new pieces of reality given, and that all that remains is
						to manage well what is and what will be and that all that is
						left to do is to secure as much of reality for oneself as one
						can!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremiah anticipates about a
						Torah-shaped community which replaces the old social reality,
						but his speech it isn't the final word! It is YHWH's freedom
						that is at work in Hebrew society. A new people is promised and
						a new political reality is given - the old disobedient past
						mentioned in last Sunday's first reading (2 Ch.36:14-23) is
						over-ridden. YHWH has moved on!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The
						Hebrew people in their imagination are now authorised to move
						on as well - waiting, listening, hoping, and anticipating the
						newness that will bring all creation under YHWH's rule; the
						land, animals and this people (Jr.31:32)! All will form a
						chorus of praise to God!<BR><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b124.html#top"><IMG SRC="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/top.gif" NAME="graphics12" ALT="topgif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=2 WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b124.html#top"><BR>top</A></P>

						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The speakers demand from the holy One what
						they cannot do for themselves; restore their personhood - with
						a 'clean heart' (v.10a). It means the ability to make a new
						beginning and having the capacity for new living!.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp;The plea for 'a new spirit' (v.10b) also asks for the
						chance to begin again. The 'wind' to govern is gladly given by
						YHWH (Is.11:2) but it is never possessed as of right! It is
						always held in trust.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The speakers place
						themselves at the complete disposal of YHWH and ask for a
						re-issue of gifts that make the good life possible. The act of
						deep repentance assumes a stance in which the gift of power for
						governing, might be given again. The original psalmist might
						have had in mind the experience of David. David lost YHWH's
						authorising power-to-rule when he acted unthinkably against
						Uriah and Bathsheba. Yet a deeply disoriented life can begin
						again!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;David was guilty of pride against
						YHWH. He imagined he was autonomous; that he could live his
						life without reference to YHWH and YHWH's commandments. Where
						there is serious disorder in our lives responsibility must be

						<H2 CLASS="western">the second reading:</H2>
						<P CLASS="western">The letter to the Hebrews is written to
						Christians who wanted to interpret Christianity as a sect
						within Hebrew religion. The writer, using the mysterious figure
						of Melchizedek, argues for a priesthood that is qualitatively
						superior to the Aaronic priesthood of Hebrew worship.</P>
						<H2 CLASS="western"><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b024lent5rdg2.html">HEBREWS
						5 : 7 - 9</A></H2>
						<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="rdg3"></A>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier in the passage the writer describes
						the characteristics of the Aaronic high priest (vv.1-4). The
						cultic priest offered sacrifices for sins, empathised with the
						weaknesses of the people and exhibited humility in light of
						being appointed by God.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the writer
						applies the same characteristics of cultic priesthood to Christ
						becomes, &quot;the source of eternal salvation&quot; (v.9 NJB).
						The priesthood of Christ, the writer argues, is realised in the
						once-for-all sacrifice that Jesus offered for sin and the
						cultic practices of the Aaronic priesthood are merely shadows
						of this offering!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old cultic
						practices are no longer valid for Christ is designated by God
						(vv.5-6,10). The writer links the title 'Son' with high-priest
						(Ps.2:7 &amp; Ps.110:4). Combining Hebrew apocalyptic 'Son of
						man' images with the language of Platonic mysticism, the writer
						interprets Jesus as the high priest established by God. 'Son'
						is a title that entails ideas of obedience and intimacy. There
						are about Christ's priesthood these qualities that clearly make
						it superior to the line of the mysterious Melchizedek.<BR>&nbsp;
						&nbsp; &nbsp;By 'obedience' to the Word (the Torah of YHWH),
						Jesus identifies with human weakness (v.8). The divine
						high-priest is not immune to suffering but learns from it -
						suffering is his tutor. Suffering is a necessary ingredient in
						faithfulness to God. The reader is encouraged. Jesus our high
						priest is our companion who empathises with our pain and
						prevents our sufferings from leading to despair.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp;Christ has been 'perfected' through suffering (v.9a)! By
						facing mortality and learning obedience in what he suffered -
						Christ is validated by God and becomes what the Aaronic
						priesthood could never be; - the source of ultimate life for
						all (v.9b)! In the final chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews
						the writer exhorts readers to take on the priestly mantle
						themselves. They are invited, &quot;to suffer outside the gate&quot;
						as Jesus did, and continually &quot;to offer unending
						sacrifices of praise to God&quot; (Hb.13:12-15 NJB)!<BR><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b124.html#top"><IMG SRC="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/top.gif" NAME="graphics14" ALT="topgif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=2 WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b124.html#top"><BR>top</A></P>

						<H2 CLASS="western">the Gospel:</H2>
						<P CLASS="western">Greek-speakers, who had come to Jerusalem
						for Passover, ask to see Jesus. Jesus' response to their
						request is expressed in terms of God's new covenant - a
						covenant that includes everyone.</P>
						<H2 CLASS="western"><A HREF="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/bfletch/b024lent5rdg3.html">JOHN
						12 : 20 - 33</A></H2>
						<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp;Facing His own imminent death, Jesus thinks in terms of
						God's covenant plan for the salvation of all humanity (v.24),
						when replying to the request of some Greek-speaking Hebrew
						worshippers who were in Jerusalem for the Passover
						(vv.20-22).<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One view of death is to
						understand it as a putting an end to further achievement. When
						dead a person can't do anything more! Or another view of death
						is that can be an achievement in itself. For example, a heroic
						death can redeem a worthless life!! Or a person's death can
						focus the achievement of a life-time. St.Paul says the death of
						Jesus was for others (Rm.4:25). That underlines the self-giving
						of Jesus was dominant in His life!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In
						the Hebrew scriptures, God's 'glory' (v.28) is any triumph of
						God over oppression. When the Hebrew people crossed the Reed
						Sea freeing themselves from Egypt, the scriptures say they saw
						God's 'glory' in the demise of the Egyptians (Ex.14:31 &amp;
						15:21). That 'glory of God' is YHWH's appearance in history.
						The God of the Hebrew scriptures is essentially liberating! Now
						the gospel writer says that this liberation comes through
						Jesus' hour of arrest, beating, ridicule, crucifixion, death
						and burial (v.23)!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jesus was 'glorified'
						in His suffering and death! Living and loving are similar
						actions. To live truly, is to give our life to others! To try
						to save our life selfishly - is not living! It is death
						'without glory' as the gospel writer would say!<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp;Jesus 'worked' for the Father's 'glory' (v.26b). His
						death is freely offered and is the completion of that work
						according to the writer (vv.27-28) in that Jesus'
						'glorification' reveals the greatness of the Father's love for
						people.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jesus is the vehicle of God's
						judgement (vv.29-33). Whenever the prophets announced a
						liberation of the people (and the punishment of the oppressors)
						they described God as &quot;coming among the clouds&quot; to
						make a judgement (J,.2:2 &amp; Zp.1:15).<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp;Jesus is saying that He is the messiah and that He is
						establishing justice on Earth. The allusion is to the book of
						Daniel (Dn.7:24) where a mysterious person, &quot;like a human
						one&quot;, is described. This mysterious one comes, &quot;among
						the clouds of heaven&quot; to rule over all the Earth!</P>

							large-print version for MS Word</A> <BR><BR>Phillips Brooks,
							author of &ldquo;O little town of Bethlehem,&rdquo; and
							briefly Bishop of Massachusetts, was also responsible for one
							of the masterpieces of American nineteenth-century church
							architecture: Trinity Church in Boston&rsquo;s Copley Square.
							Brooks played a very direct role in Trinity&rsquo;s design.
							However, there is one feature of Brooks&rsquo; design that is
							visible only to those who preach in Trinity church. Brooks had
							these words carved on the inside of Trinity&rsquo;s pulpit:
							&ldquo;Sir, we would see Jesus.&rdquo; 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">They are, of course, the words that &ldquo;some
							Greeks&rdquo; spoke to Philip when both they and Jesus and his
							disciples were on their way to Jerusalem. The Greeks were more
							than likely non-Jews who were fascinated by Judaism&rsquo;s
							antiquity and its profound ethical teaching. They were known
							as &ldquo;God-fearers,&rdquo; and they were numerous in the
							first century. Many of these &ldquo;God-fearers&rdquo; would
							have converted to Judaism had it not been for the requirement
							of circumcision. Along with Jesus and his disciples, the
							&ldquo;God-fearers&rdquo; were on their way to celebrate
							Passover in Jerusalem. But Jesus was also on his way to
							suffer, die on the cross, and be raised again.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">When Philip reported to Jesus that the
							Greeks had asked to see him, Jesus exclaimed, &ldquo;The hour
							has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&rdquo; This is a
							major turning point in John&rsquo;s gospel. Scholars tell us
							that John is divided into the &ldquo;book of signs&rdquo; and
							the &ldquo;book of glory.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;book of signs&rdquo;
							(the first part of John) Jesus performs seven miracles that
							John refers to as signs. They begin when Jesus turns water
							into wine at the wedding feast at Cana and culminate with
							Jesus&rsquo; greatest miracle: raising Lazarus from the dead.
							Throughout the &ldquo;book of signs&rdquo; Jesus makes
							enigmatic references to his &ldquo;hour&rdquo; or &ldquo;time&rdquo;
							and says that it has not yet come. When his mother tells him
							that the revelers at the wedding feast have run out of wine,
							he says, &ldquo;My hour has not yet come.&rdquo; In John 7:8,
							Jesus tells his disciples that he will not go to Jerusalem for
							the Feast of Booths because his &ldquo;time has not yet fully
							come.&rdquo; 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">But when the Greeks asked to see Jesus, he
							knew that the hour had come for him to be glorified. As Jesus
							amplifies his enigmatic comment about the hour of his
							glorification having come, we realize that Jesus&rsquo; idea
							of glory and our idea of glory are radically different. For
							Jesus, to be glorified was to embrace the cross, the epitome
							of suffering: 
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the
							earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it
							dies, it bears much fruit. &hellip; Now my soul is troubled.
							And what should I say &ndash; &lsquo;Father, save me from this
							hour&rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to
							this hour. &hellip; And I, when I am lifted up from the earth,
							will draw all people to myself.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<P CLASS="western">Because non-Jews such as the Greeks were
							seeking to meet Jesus, he knew that his mission was no longer
							restricted to Israel but had become universal. It was time for
							him to be lifted up &ndash; that is, crucified &ndash; so that
							all people could be drawn to him.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">For us glory is about having more: more
							money, more prestige, more power. For Jesus, glory was about
							giving more, and he demonstrates this throughout John&rsquo;s
							gospel, but nowhere more vividly than in the final chapters.
							Jesus gives himself to his friends by washing their feet. Then
							he gives himself to the world by dying on the cross.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">It is the completion of the great arc of
							self-emptying that began with the opening verses of John. The
							cosmic Word by which God spoke creation into being descends
							from on high and is clothed with flesh, &ldquo;and we beheld
							his glory.&rdquo; The Word Incarnate heals the sick, feeds the
							multitude, raises the dead, and finally completes his task by
							dying on the cross, and only then resumes the glory that is
							rightfully his.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Sir, we would see Jesus.&rdquo;
							Phillips Brooks knew that everyone who steps into a pulpit and
							presumes to preach the gospel needs to think about those
							words, because the great temptation of preaching is to give
							our hearers something other than Jesus. &ldquo;We would see
							Jesus,&rdquo; our listeners plead, and we give them our
							learning, comments on the day&rsquo;s news, a witty joke or
							two, but too often there is little of Jesus in our preaching. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">But it is not only preachers who do this.
							All around us are people who want to see Jesus. Do they see
							him in us? Do they see the Servant-Lord who washed the feet of
							his friends? Do they see the prophet who cleansed the Temple?
							Do they see the healer who made the blind to see? If we are to
							let people see Jesus in us, then we must go ourselves and sit
							at his feet, let him heal us, feed upon his body broken for
							us, and above all stand at the cross and wonder as the Word
							that spoke out of the void lapses into silence and death.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">A few years ago, a rabbi at a large Reform
							synagogue published an editorial in the local newspaper on
							Christmas Day. He said, &ldquo;I like Christmas, and I like
							Christians. My only problem with both is that they need more
							Jesus.&rdquo;</P>
							<P CLASS="western">Precisely. Sometimes those who are outside
							the circle of the church can see and name our problems far
							better than we can. We all need a lot more Jesus. It&rsquo;s
							not only a problem for preachers; it&rsquo;s a problem for
							every one of us who are called by the name of Christian. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Sir, we would see Jesus,&rdquo; the
							Greeks said to Philip. We, too, need to see Jesus, so that
							when others want to see Jesus, they can see him in us. As the
							old spiritual puts it: 
							</P>
							<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>In the morning when I rise,<BR>Give me

						<P CLASS="western">Revd Kristin Ofstad, Minister, Thurso United
						Reformed Church</P>
						<H3>Telling the time correctly</H3>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Timing matters. We know it,
						and Ecclesiastes 3 expresses it very eloquently for us:</P>
						<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">&lsquo;For everything
						there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven: a
						time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time
						to pluck up what is planted; a time to kill, and a time to
						heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up &hellip;..&rsquo;.</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Timing is crucial for the
						Jesus we meet in John&rsquo;s gospel. When his mother persuades
						him to solve the wine problem at Cana, he does so reluctantly
						because &lsquo;my hour has not yet come&rsquo; (2:4).&nbsp; As
						his reputation grows, he manages to dodge those who try to
						arrest him &lsquo;because his hour had not yet come&rsquo;
						(7:30 and 8:20). He speaks of &lsquo;the hour that is coming&rsquo;
						several times (4:21,23; 5:25,28; 16:25,32). Therefore, when in
						today&rsquo;s text he finally says that &lsquo;the hour has
						come&rsquo;, we should realise that we have reached the
						absolutely pivotal point in the whole story. The writer of the
						story has also ensured that it is Jesus himself who is in
						control of his own fate. He states it clearly in 10:15-18:</P>
						<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">I lay down my life for
						the sheep. I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold.
						I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So
						there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the
						Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it
						up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own
						accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take
						it up again. I have received this command from my Father.</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><A NAME="more-542"></A>In
						today&rsquo;s text we hear Jesus say, &lsquo;Now my soul is
						troubled. And what should I say - Father, save me from this
						hour? No, it is for this reason I have come to this hour&rsquo;.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Jesus we encounter today
						shows great focus and a profound grasp of timing. His moment
						has come, because the Greeks have asked to see him. His
						salvation is for everyone, everywhere, and he has waited and
						waited for the &lsquo;other sheep&rsquo; to turn up and
						acknowledge that he is for them, too. The dodging game, the
						hiding can stop. He can step out onto the world stage and lay
						down his life in order to save the world. He is about to step
						into the glory of fulfilling the purpose of his life - to do
						his Father&rsquo;s will unequivocally, without hesitation. The
						little parable about the seed having to die before the fruit
						can happen is like a key that unlocks the mystery.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What do I mean by that?&nbsp;
						I am saying that we should understand that the purpose of
						creation is to teach us about the God of redemption, and also
						to teach us about the purpose of our existence. Everything in
						creation is an illustration, a visual parable, of death and
						resurrection. Life cannot happen without the dying and rising.
						And so it is with us. New life, rebirth, transformation cannot
						happen in our lives without our letting go of that which holds
						us back. In creation new life cannot happen if the seed is not
						planted. Jesus is not only the once-and-only Word made flesh.
						He is also the one who shows us the purpose of our lives,
						namely to live in the knowledge that we exist in order &lsquo;to
						make the reality of God present&rsquo;. For this we need to be
						focussed and alert at all times in order to fulfil the meaning
						and purpose of our lives, i.e. to grasp those moments when we
						can say, along with Jesus, &lsquo;the hour has come&rsquo;.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We tend to speak of our
						journeying in individual terms, but it is essential that we
						talk of the local church and its calling to be a living
						interpretation of the good news of God&rsquo;s love. Even more
						than individuals, local congregations are constantly being
						called to set out for God&rsquo;s country and to give God&rsquo;s
						Word flesh - to make the reality of God present in <EM>their</EM>
						neighbourhood, <EM>their</EM> town, <EM>their</EM> time in
						history. That is what the church exists for; it has no other
						meaning or purpose than making the reality of God present here
						and now.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>When do we ever hear from a
						local church these words: &lsquo;The hour has come for us to
						fulfil that for which we were called. <EM>Now</EM> is the
						moment we have been waiting for, when God requires of us
						something extraordinary, now is the moment when we must find
						the courage to die from the past and become a new creation!&rsquo;</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>When this does happen, a local
						church can be and do amazing things which blaze with the glory
						of God present. Neighbourhoods transformed. Communities built.
						Debts rescinded. Children given opportunity. The hungry fed.
						Beauty rediscovered. Even more astonishing things happen when
						local churches from different traditions get together to do
						God&rsquo;s new thing for their neighbourhood or their town.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We must constantly be on the
						alert and prepared for our moment, so that we do not miss it.
						Jesus immediately knew that his hour had come when the Greeks
						asked to see him. So should it be with us, the church on the
						street corner, in the deprived neighbourhood, in the town
						centre or in the rural village. Always, there is the
						possibility that God can and will do wonderful, glorious,
						life-giving work in and through his people. In the words of our
						epistle text today:</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>For we are what he has made
						us, created in Christ for good works, which God prepared
						beforehand to be our way of life. (Ephesians 2:10)</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Diogenes Allen, in an incisive
						essay on the missional challenge of late postmodern western
						culture, suggested that Christopher Fry had captured our
						situation well in his play <EM>A Sleep of Prisoners. </EM>Allen
						introduced the quotation with these comments:</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We remain captives within a
						mental framework that has actually been broken. We are like
						prisoners who could walk out of a prison because all that would
						enclose us has been burst open, but we remain inside because we
						are asleep. Christopher Fry, however, tells us that this is the
						time to wake up.</P>
						<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in">&ldquo;The

						<H1 CLASS="western">The Hour Has Come</H1>
						<P CLASS="western">MARCH&nbsp;31, 2003 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Fifth Sunday of Lent (B), April 6, 2003<BR>&ldquo;I
						will draw everyone to myself&rdquo; (Jn 12:32) 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">T he season of Lent is drawing to its
						conclusion. The hour has come. We may think that the hour
						referred to in John&rsquo;s Gospel is the hour of Jesus&rsquo;
						death. It is, but the author gives that dreaded hour a most
						unexpected meaning. He claims that the hour of Jesus&rsquo;
						death is really the hour of his glorification. He further
						insists that Jesus is glorified, not as a martyr, but as the
						source of new life for us. We hear this so often that we might
						fail to realize the paradox here: Jesus&rsquo; death brings us
						new life. What does this mean? The readings for today provide
						us with an answer.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Through the prophet Jeremiah, God announces
						a new covenant. This does not mean that the other covenants
						have been abrogated. We are still creatures of the earth (Gn
						9), who cling to God&rsquo;s promises (Gn 22), who are subject
						to God&rsquo;s law (Ex 20), and who are embraced by God&rsquo;s
						mercy (Jer 31). This new covenant will be something quite
						different, something extraordinary. Written on our hearts, it
						will effect an interior transformation.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The evils of today, those we witness and
						those of which we are a part, require much more than simple
						external change. If we are honest, we will admit that we need
						radical interior transformation. Our self-absorption and
						unbridled pursuit of personal satisfaction, our arrogant sense
						of superiority, the hatred and desire for revenge that eat at
						our hearts can be remedied only at their roots. We are
						certainly in need of a new covenant commitment.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The technical covenant formula, &ldquo;I
						will be their God and they will be my people,&rdquo; is
						comparable to the marriage formula, &ldquo;I do take you as my
						spouse.&rdquo; This language bespeaks loving intimacy. These
						words should make us step back in total amazement, for they
						imply that in the face of human infidelity, God establishes a
						covenant of the heart. Perhaps the failure of so many human
						commitments between couples, within families, at the workplace
						and even among nations clouds our eyes to the reality of God&rsquo;s
						unbounded love. This is a remarkable covenant. When will it be
						established? &ldquo;The days are coming, says the Lord.&rdquo;</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The sentiments of Psalm 51 might well be our
						response to God&rsquo;s astounding offer of loving commitment:
						&ldquo;Have mercy on me...wipe out my offense...create a clean
						heart in me.&rdquo; Today we might say: Help me to accept what
						I find bothersome in others; heal me of my stubbornness, my
						selfishness and my pride; cleanse me of hatred for people of
						cultures that are foreign to me and of nations that might pose
						a threat.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">God announces that the days are coming when
						all of this will happen. Deep down in our hearts, can we
						believe this? Are we doing anything to bring it about? But even
						in the face of doubt, God declares: The days are coming.</P>

						<P CLASS="western">As we turn to the Gospel, we hear Jesus say,
						&ldquo;The hour has come.&rdquo; True, it is the hour of his
						death, but it is also the hour of his glorification. While this
						glorification may refer in part to the unique relationship that
						he enjoys with God (&ldquo;a voice came from heaven&rdquo;),
						the reading suggests that it also has something to do with the
						new life that will spring from his death. Jesus&rsquo;
						obedience to his destiny, mentioned in both the Gospel and the
						reading from Hebrews, opens the doors of life for us. In this
						he is glorified.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">To whom will this new life be offered? The
						words in Jeremiah are addressed to both Israel and Judah, the
						two kingdoms that made up the entire nation. God calls these
						separated people to &ldquo;be my people.&rdquo; The Gospel
						teaches us that this new covenant is not merely meant for the
						Jewish people. Greeks, representatives of the entire world,
						came to see Jesus. In other words, all women and men of
						integrity are to be invited to this covenant. Jesus declares:
						&ldquo;I will draw everyone to myself.&rdquo;</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Today we hear of a new covenant, a clean
						heart, a grain of wheat pregnant with fruitfulness. These are
						all poetic ways of describing the new way of living into which
						we can step if we so choose. The disarray of so much of our
						lives makes us realize that we must choose a different way of
						living. But radical transformation does not come without a
						price. For our sake, Jesus suffered dearly, and he insists:
						&ldquo;Whoever serves me must follow me.&rdquo; And there is
						the rub!</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Now that our Lenten journey is almost over,
						what have we learned from the readings of this season? In what
						ways are we willing to change? Whom are we willing to help? To
						forgive? To what extent are we willing to die to our own
						selfishness so that the fruits of the new covenant can be
						brought forward? The hour of decision has come.</P>
						<P CLASS="western"><STRONG>Praying with Scripture</STRONG></P>
						<P CLASS="western">&bull; Read the psalm prayerfully, asking
						God for a clean heart and a steadfast spirit.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">&bull; Choose one or two ways in which you
						can live a renewed life.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">&bull; Pray for the grace to be faithful to
						your new insights, regardless of the price they may exact.</P>

						<H1 CLASS="western">What Would Jesus Do?</H1>
						<P CLASS="western">APRIL&nbsp;1, 2000 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Fifth Sunday of Lent (B), April 9,
						2000<BR>&quot;Give me back the joy of your salvation and a
						willing spirit sustain in me&quot; (Ps. 51:14) 
						</P>
						<P CLASS="western">In these last two weeks of Lent, the
						readings draw our eyes to the crucified one, with a focus on
						what God has done for us. The promise of the new covenant
						embodies the aging Jeremiah&rsquo;s spiritual testament to an
						exiled people: that even though they have sinned in the past,
						&quot;I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&quot;
						It will be written on the hearts of the people, and their
						acceptance will not be taught but will arise from their deep
						experience of forgiveness, &quot;for I will forgive their evil
						doing and remember their sin no more.&quot; Though the term
						&quot;new covenant&quot; appears only here in the Old
						Testament, at the Last Supper Jesus will describe his
						self-offering as a new covenant (Lk. 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25).</P>
						<P CLASS="western">Today&rsquo;s Gospel concludes John&rsquo;s
						presentation of the public ministry of Jesus and provides the
						bridge to the story of his final days. The Greeks who would
						like &quot;to see&quot; Jesus underscore the universal
						dimension of the lifting up and glorification of the Son of
						Man, when &quot;I will draw everyone to myself.&quot; Having
						witnessed both the sadness of death and God&rsquo;s triumph
						over it (described in the preceding story of Lazarus) and
						having reached the hour of his imminent death, Jesus now speaks
						of the paradox of life through death. As the springtime
						festival of Passover nears, Jesus points to the mystery of the
						grain of wheat, which after seeming to lie dead in the soil now
						springs up throughout the land to sustain life. This dying and
						rising provides a paradigm for discipleship. Whoever loves his
						life will lose it, and whoever hates it will gain eternal life.
						These words seem jarring to an age aware of the dangers of
						self-loathing and lack of self-esteem. &quot;Loving life&quot;
						in John does not refer to the proper sense of dignity and joy
						that one should have as a graced person; it means a preference
						for &quot;the world&quot; and human glory that can blind a
						person to God&rsquo;s love. Hatred of one&rsquo;s life means
						rejection of the claims of the &quot;world&quot; and
						willingness to serve and follow Jesus. This becomes explicit in
						the next saying, &quot;whoever serves me, must follow me.&quot;</P>
						<P CLASS="western">This cost of losing one&rsquo;s life touches
						Jesus himself as he speaks, in the Synoptic Gospels&rsquo;
						accounts of the events in Gethsemane, from the depths of his
						troubled soul, &quot;Father, save me from this hour,&quot;
						while accepting that it was for the glory of his Father that he
						has come to the hour of his passion. As at his baptism in Mark,
						the barrier between heaven and earth is bridged, and a heavenly
						voice accepts Jesus&rsquo; offering, which Jesus then says was
						&quot;for your sake,&quot; since by his death the power of evil
						will be broken.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The reading from the Letter to the Hebrews
						plays a similar symphony about the Passion in a different key.
						It speaks of Jesus &quot;in the days of his flesh,&quot; a
						biblical expression for the sphere of weakness and suffering to
						which Christ was subject, as he prayed to the one who could
						save him from death. This does not mean avoiding physical death
						but rescue from the power and realm of death. In Hebrews Jesus
						is a compassionate high priest, who shares flesh and blood with
						God&rsquo;s sons and daughters, and who was himself tested
						through what he suffered so he could help others equally tested
						(2:14-16). Today&rsquo;s reading says that Jesus &quot;learned
						obedience&quot; from what he suffered. Biblical obedience is
						not primarily following the will of another, but a &quot;deep
						listening&quot;&mdash;in the case of Jesus, not only to his
						Father, but, as the compassionate one, to the sufferings of his
						brothers and sisters. His life and suffering were a school of
						deep listening and compassion. This is the Jesus whose loving
						service and enduring presence we celebrate over the next two
						weeks.</P>
						<P CLASS="western">The readings lead us into the deepest
						mysteries of Christian faith: the allure of &quot;the world,&quot;
						the inevitability of death and suffering, even the call to
						embrace it, along with the ringing paradox that loss of human
						life is the gain of eternal life; that we have a compassionate
						high priest, whose soul was also troubled as he faced the abyss
						of death, but whose death was an enduring covenant of
						forgiveness inscribed with the promise that &quot;where I am,
						there also will my servant be.&quot;

							<P CLASS="western"><EM>Now among those who went up to worship
							at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was
							from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &quot;Sir, we wish
							to see Jesus.&quot; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew
							and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &quot;The
							hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly,
							I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and
							dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears
							much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who
							hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
							Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will
							my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.
							&quot;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say-&lsquo;Father,
							save me from this hour'? No, it is for this reason that I have
							come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&quot; Then a
							voice came from heaven, &quot;I have glorified it, and I will
							glorify it again.&quot; The crowd standing there heard it and
							said that it was thunder. Others said, &quot;An angel has
							spoken to him.&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;This voice has come
							for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this
							world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I,
							when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to
							myself.&quot; He said this to indicate the kind of death he
							was to die.&nbsp; (NRSV)</EM></P>
							<P CLASS="western">CHECKING THE NAME ON THE TENT</P>
							<P CLASS="western">This week is the annual South by Southwest
							(SXSW) festival in Austin. Hundreds of thousands of people
							come from around the U.S. and some from around the world to
							experience the newest bands and the trendiest sounds on the
							planet. Some of the musicians are hoping to be heard by
							agents. Some of them want to hear the sounds being created by
							colleagues unknown to them. Many spectators love to go because
							they want to be where a crowd is. Some hope to meet a partner
							or have a one-night-stand. Some go simply because it's Spring
							Break and they have to be somewhere. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">In the midst of these crowds there will be
							many lost souls. They may not have started out that way, but
							as the days of the event mooch along, they realize that they
							didn't find what they were looking for. Or that those they
							thought were their friends didn't turn out to be friends. Or
							even more problematic, in the midst of the all the music and
							the noise, the sound and the fury, they may realize they don't
							know what this is all about-or whether their life has any
							meaning at all for them</P>
							<P CLASS="western">This problem is not only discovered at
							SXSW. All around the United States, and around the world, for
							that matter, people are discovering that the big band sound
							and the promise of superficial affluence has led to a rather
							scary uncertainty in the market square. Those who were riding
							the waves of confidence are now finding that something was
							missing in the promise that said that if you followed the
							crowd you would find what the crowd was looking for. However,
							this what's called the &quot;lemming's surprise.&quot; When we
							all chase one another over the cliff, we find that neither the
							crowd nor its leader knew what lay ahead.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">A recent article <EM>in USA.Today</EM>
							explored the false hope that uncertain times lift up through
							palm readers, soothsayers, fortunetellers, tarot card analysts
							and astrologers. When people have no sure foundation, and they
							are uncertain about what the future holds, they turn to those
							who promise to offer the gaze of Nostradamus or the wisdom of
							the Oracle at Delphi. In Austin, where I live, a women who
							tells fortunes has been able to erect a very impressive
							limestone house on Highway 35 as one approaches the urban
							center. High fences around the mansion attest to some
							treasures inside. One can only wonder who the desperate people
							are who have made her rich.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">And similarly, if one could set up tents
							midst the throngs of those gathered for SXSW or many another
							street festival or Renaissance Fair, he/she might discover
							many who peek inside the tent to find answers for their
							besetting questions-- whether about meaning or money, destiny
							or purpose. It's worth asking, when you yourself have
							uncertainty or even despair, into which tents do you peek for
							answers? And, should you be looking right now, is there
							something here in this tent, this <EM>domus ecclesiae</EM>,
							this house of God, which can address your concerns?</P>
							<P CLASS="western">I think that something like this was going
							on in today's Gospel lesson. Mobs of people were gathered in
							Jerusalem for the Passover Feast, largely a family festival.
							If you had no family in Jerusalem, it was uncertain what you
							would be doing when the families assembled at table. The noise
							and smells were overwhelming. People were buying and selling
							preparations. Natives of other countries were present as
							merchants. Some were bewildered, wondering what this could
							mean to them. Among them were a couple of Greeks, or at least
							Greek-speaking Jews, and they were thinking about checking out
							the Jesus tent. In any case, they found a Greek-speaker by the
							name of Philip and said, &quot;We'd like to talk to Jesus.&quot;
							Unsure that he could just usher them into the tent, Philip
							checked with another Greek-speaking friend, Andrew. They
							talked it over and both of them went to tell Jesus that he had
							visitors. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">Jesus brings them in the tent (you realize
							that I'm dramatizing a little bit) and takes their hands in
							his. They are looking for answers and he has what they are
							looking for. He tells that that if a grain of wheat doesn't
							get buried in the ground and die, it just lies on the surface
							and is useless. But if it dies, and only then, it bears much
							fruit. If all you're interested in doing is saving your
							life-acquiring possessions, establishing reputations, becoming
							important, you will lose your life. You will end up with
							something that is useless. But if you concern yourself with
							the needs of others, you will fill your life with meaning and
							keep it forever.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">These Greeks had gone into the right tent.
							One can only wonder what later became of them. Did they hear
							these words and follow them, or did they say, &quot;Let's
							check out the Tarot Card tent?&quot; This is the challenge
							humans have always faced. You don't have to be a Bernard
							Madoff to want it all. We are greedy little gremlins from our
							youth. I have always believed that original sin is a valid
							theological concept. You don't have to be reasonable and
							educated to want it your way, to want what seems to fulfill
							you most. You just need to human. It is the nature of
							humanness to want to be at the center of attention, to want to
							lead rather than to follow, to claim my rights before the
							rights of others.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">This is why Jesus is different. This is why
							he points us away from ourselves, difficult as that may be-and
							different as it is from the style of religious phonies who
							preach self-aggrandizement, or the Gospel of Success.&nbsp;
							This is why the Lenten story has been a story about dying to
							one's self for five weeks now. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">Ultimately, the Lenten story is about
							crucifixion, the time when those who refused to hear the story
							put an end to the storyteller, at least so they thought. All
							along, however, Jesus has been showing people how to care for
							maligned and mistreated, alienated and disenfranchised (big
							words all). What troubled Jesus most of all was that people
							were being shoved aside in the name of God, in the name of
							religion. It was the religious leaders who created the
							barriers to acceptance for the poor, the lame, the blind, the
							leper. When he tried to show them that the heart of being a
							child of God was to be a lover of God's children, they said
							they had had enough and they crucified him. The very dying to
							one's self that Jesus had been lifting up all along as the
							basis for real life became objectified on Calvary. Can we ever
							make sense of this? 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">Some of this is familiar territory and some
							of this is hard to follow. Yet scary as this tent may be to
							some who are afraid to come to the church and hear the Gospel,
							Jesus is here today to tell us when it looks like all is lost
							or like we can't possibly make sense of a life which doesn't
							bargain to make us a winner, we are on the threshold of
							opportunity. He himself had to struggle with this. He says,
							&quot;Should I say, &lsquo;Father, save me from this hour?'
							No, giving myself for the sake of others is precisely the
							reason why I came to this hour.&quot; As St. Francis put it in
							his famous prayer, &quot;It is in giving that we receive, and
							it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.&quot; 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">How many are those who have looked at a
							challenge and said, &quot;This is too big for me. If I do
							this, I won't be able to have that.&quot; And the bargain
							means that you settle for something for yourself and in the
							end get nothing at all. Or maybe a prison cell. Mr. Madoff
							knows the answer here.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">By contrast, when Mother Theresa was faced
							with the first leper, I wonder what she wanted to say. There
							was surely a human voice in her that was dying to speak. And
							there was also a voice from Jesus dying to be heard in its own
							way. We know this very well as we are confronted with
							challenges and opportunities, with the need to define
							ourselves and to affirm the faith that is within us.</P>
							<P CLASS="western">In the midst of life's fairs and festivals,
							Passovers and Palm Sundays, there are many tents with names on
							them bidding for our attention. Sometimes we aren't sure what
							we're looking for. We don't know if life is meaningful or at a
							dead end. But before we do anything crazy, before we walk
							boldly into a tent we know nothing about, we ought to check
							name on it first. 
							</P>
							<P CLASS="western">Jesus is inside only one of them. And
							Philip and Andrew are with him, not to mention two Greeks. And
							there are hours to spend and a life to discover when we learn
							how to plant a seed and let it die before it rises.</P>

						You'd Like to See Jesus?</STRONG> </FONT></FONT>
						</P>
						<DIV ID="Section7" DIR="LTR">
							<P CLASS="western">Like the Greeks in the Gospel, I think most
							of us would like to get a glimpse or more of this Jesus, they
							were so interested in.&nbsp; I believe that many &quot;pilgrims&quot;
							go to Palestine and visit the sites where it is known that
							Jesus visited.&nbsp; Perhaps in walking where he walked and
							seeing what he saw, Jesus will become more real to them.&nbsp;
							They will be able to visualize him better, at least in their
							minds' eye and in their hearts. What kind of Jesus do you
							think they see?=C 2&nbsp; Some artists rendering of what he
							thinks Jesus looked like?&nbsp; Some picture painted of Jesus
							holding a lamb in his arms?&nbsp; Perhaps a Jesus who welcomes
							children, picks them up and blesses them? And then there is
							the question:&nbsp; what kind of Jesus do you see?&nbsp; Have
							you perhaps come here to this place called a church to catch a
							glimpse of this person who performed miracles, healings, was
							master of the wind and wave, loved prostitutes and terrorists
							(Zealots), and so many more, perhaps even you?&nbsp; Are you
							and I looking to see a Jesus who will somehow in some
							extraordinary way see us through to the happy land of good
							economics, full employment, big 401(k)s and the good life?&nbsp;
							Do we come to see a Jesus who somehow takes away the bruises
							that we experience as men and women in this world: separation
							in divorce, children going nuts on us, people betraying us,
							having a personality warped by an upbringing that left us with
							thoughts of self-loathing and then anger? So you'd like to see
							Jesus?&nbsp; What is Jesus' reply to Philip and Andrew who
							made this request to Jesus?&nbsp; Remember that these two were
							the first to bring people to Jesus-their brothers to Jesus.&nbsp;
							Now they bring more to Jesus. You will find in the answer
							Jesus gives a whole different perspective of Jesus, a vision
							of him that centers first of all on his mission in this world,
							then on his humanity and ours, and finally on the decision we
							are going to have to make about this picture of Jesus. Jesus
							begins by saying: &quot;The hour has come for the Son of Man
							to be glorified.&quot;&nbsp; Jesus without a doubt is this Son
							of Man who is at the same time the Son of the Most High God.&nbsp;
							His time of glory has come.&nbsp;&nbsp; Glory is one of those
							words we have a hard time defining.&nbsp; I like to think of
							it as the true revelation of showing what and who a person
							is.&nbsp; You will get a true picture of Jesus in the &quot;hour&quot;
							he is talking about. What is that hour?&nbsp; It is the hour
							of the cross.&nbsp; There on Calvary's mountain you will see
							Jesus for what he truly is.&nbsp; We who come here so
							regularly&nbsp; are not shocked by the cross of Jesus
							anymore.&nbsp; We become used to thinking of him being
							crucified and then dying there.&nbsp; &quot;So?&quot; as our
							former vice president said in response to being asked about
							the soldiers killed in Iraq. The place of the cross of Jesus
							was not a nice place to be.&nbsp; It smelled putridly of
							blood, feces and urine.&nbsp; It was place of inhuman torture
							of a human being.&nbsp; It was a place where death and decay
							was expected and hoped for. And &quot;the hour has come for
							the Son of Man to be glorified&quot; there. There you see who
							he truly is. In pain above pain, in physical distress beyond
							anything we can imagine or even are permitted to experience
							today. There is the true picture of who this Jesus is. The
							words ring out: 9 CFather, forgive them.&nbsp; They don't know
							what they are doing.&quot;&nbsp; Who the soldiers?&nbsp; No,
							you and I.&nbsp; We don't know what we are doing.&nbsp; We
							hurt others, lie, deceive, torture others with words and
							more.&nbsp; We drop bombs on people as if it is our right and
							our duty.&nbsp; We use drugs creating devastation in every
							city and open warfare in many border towns.&nbsp; Do you and I
							really think we know what we are doing?&nbsp; Do we need a
							Father's forgiveness? Who is this Jesus who says that and so
							much more.&nbsp; He is on a mission of his Father, who because
							of Jesus and the Holy Spirit is also our heavenly Father now.&nbsp;
							His Father loves the whole world, every last man, woman, boy
							and girl and baby-every last one! We can hardly love our
							family and often don't.&nbsp; But this Father loves us even
							when we are dead to him, enemies of him, blind-have no vision
							of him at all as God a nd Lord of all.&nbsp; He loves and
							wants us to see him, have an intimate relationship with him
							and love to talk with him in prayer, praise and thanksgiving.
							But the rot of sin, the termite ridden house we think is so
							wonderful, the clothes we hide in which stink like the bottom
							of an outhouse must be removed, taken away, destroyed, and
							every enemy and the prince of this world, devil must be driven
							out for us to be restored to the presence of this Father of
							our Lord Jesus Christ. See Jesus as the One who loves his
							Father, goes on the mission to destroy our sin and our
							pretence to goodness so that we might through Jesus see, yes,
							see, behold, get the sight of our loving heavenly Father.
							Jesus falls like a seed into the ground so that as he dies,
							many more like him, pure, loved by the Father, might be
							produced.&nbsp; This is his glory!&nbsp; This is who Jesus is!
							As Jesus promises, where he is, there his servants will be
							also.&nbsp; He loses his life so that many might be rescued
							from an incorrect, fatal picture of who he is.&nbsp; He
							removes the cataracts of our evil.&nbsp; Behold, Jesus dying
							on the cross because he loves the Father and the Father loves
							him and he loves us so much! You don't see this Jesus, you
							haven't got any idea who Jesus really is! It is in the mission
							of Jesus that God is glorified, seen for who he truly is.&nbsp;
							This mission of Jesus was not easy.&nbsp; He was not dancing
							through the tulips to do this for us.&nbsp; His heart was
							troubled.&nbsp; It's hard to imagine, to think that this
							person Jesus was ever troubled.&nbsp; But it was.&nbsp; Ah, no
							one has seen the trouble I've experienced we say.&nbsp; Jesus
							who even knew how everything was going to turn out, didn't see
							what lay ahead of him as being a cake walk.&nbsp; He knew what
							death was about.&nbsp; It was God leaving forever what he had
							created and walking away to leave what was left to fend for
							itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cries of Jesus from the cross of &quot;My
							God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; were real.&nbsp;
							His cries were the ones of&nbsp; experiencing what living
							without God's loving care and preservation of life and hope.&nbsp;
							It killed him! You have to see this Jesus or you will have
							missed seeing him at all. Jesus tells those who were around
							him that he was the light but that the light would be
							overtaken by darkness.&nbsp; He tells us to walk in the light
							because in the darkness of self-conceived thoughts about God,
							life, and the future is walking in total darkness. &quot;Thy
							Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my way&quot; said the
							poet writer of ancient days.&nbsp; The John who wrote the
							words of our Gospel for today says Jesus is the Word.&nbsp;
							Jesus is the lamp.&nbsp; He is the sun of righteousness with
							healing for all our wounds&nbsp; caused by sin and
							iniquities.&nbsp;20He is one who causes no shadows or darkness
							in our lives.&nbsp; I want you to trust Jesus as the light.&nbsp;
							Without Jesus making your every day a bright vision of his
							love and care, you will succumb to the darkness where there is
							only weeping and gnashing of teeth in despair.&nbsp; Trust
							Jesus; he will lead you always.&nbsp; I beg of you during this
							Lenten time to give yourselves anew to Jesus so that you may
							becomes sons and daughters who give light to others. All too
							often others get less than a clear picture of Jesus because in
							our brokenness we reflect a distorted Jesus.&nbsp; Today while
							you are in the light, renew your trust in Jesus and be the
							light of the world which you can and will be as you see this
							Jesus of the cross, the grave and the resurrection. What does
							Jesus see in you?&nbsp; Enough of God's creation to want to be
							in you and with you.&nbsp; So come to the Sacrament, rejoicing
							that Jesus sees you clearly now, although we may only see him
							dimly.&nbsp; But the time will come of which the Sacrament is
							a foretaste when we shall see him clearly face to face. So
							you'd like to see Jesus?&nbsp; Did you get a little glimpse of
							him today?&nbsp; Amen.</P>
