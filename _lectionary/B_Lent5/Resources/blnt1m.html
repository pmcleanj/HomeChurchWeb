<B>Genesis</B>
<P>
Genesis is the first book of the Bible. It begins with two versions of the 
creation story, neither of them intended to be scientific but telling us why 
we are on earth. In the story of Adam and Eve, it tells us that we are 
responsible, under God, for the care of all creation. It then continues with 
the stories of the patriarchs: Abraham (who enters into a covenant (or treaty) 
with God), Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Peter</B>
<P>
An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<B>Mark</B>
<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

start new lives in God. Jesus, too, is baptised by John &#8211; Mark does not tell us why. The opening of the heavens symbolizes the start of a new mode of communication between God and humankind. Perhaps &#8220;like a dove&#8221; (v.
