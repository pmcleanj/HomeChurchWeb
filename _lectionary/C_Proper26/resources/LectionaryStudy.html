<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Right now, our &ldquo;40
Days of Purpose&rdquo; campaign is in full swing. Most of us are
involved in small-group studies focussing on the 40 days of purpose,
and our Readings in church are the ones recommended for the campaign.
It's an appropriate time to consider the role that Scripture readings
play in our Church's worship life and in our own lives.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Following a Lectionary gives
us a disciplined pattern of Scripture reading: it prevents &ldquo;Scripture
hopping&rdquo;, and the use of truncated out-of-context readings, and
avoiding difficult readings. The 40-Days readings are chosen for a
specific focus. During these weeks when those are the only readings
we will be getting in Worship, it is even more important to continue
our regular pattern of readings through personal and group Bible
study.</P>

working on during prayers and hymns! Everyone has a pew-work folder.
You can put your pew-work in your folder at the end of church or at
the start of next week's study. If you miss a week we'll put your
pew-work in your folder for you to take later.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
