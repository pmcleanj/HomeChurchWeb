<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<li>he is sending upon them &#8220;what my Father promised&#8221;.</li>

Bethany (near Jerusalem) and &#8220;was carried up into heaven&#8221;; then they &#8220;returned to Jerusalem&#8221;.</p>
<p>Acts backtracks: vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+1%3A3-5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3-5</a>

many days from now&#8221; they will receive the Holy Spirit &#8211; at Pentecost,
the fiftieth day since Easter. Together in Jerusalem, the disciples
ask: what will happen in this new era?: <em>either</em>: when will you restore independence to Israel? <em>or </em>is the end of time at hand? Jesus answers (v.

ascension, a clearly <em>visible</em> event set in a <em>historical</em> context. (Note the five words about <em>seeing</em>.)
The &#8220;cloud&#8221; in Elijah&#8217;s ascension and in Jesus&#8217; is a sign of God&#8217;s
presence. But the event goes beyond the physical; it needs
interpretation by &#8220;two men ...&#8221;, messengers from God: Jesus&#8217; return
will be a divine intervention in human affairs. Bethany and the Mount
of Olives (&#8220;Olivet&#8221;, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+1%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>) are adjacent and close to 
Jerusalem. The eleven disciples possibly return to the site of the Last Supper, &#8220;the room upstairs&#8221; (v.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<p>Difficult to interpret, this psalm seems to have accompanied a
liturgy (drama) in the Temple depicting the movement of the Israelites

<em>snippets</em>, each a few verses long, commemorating God&#8217;s championship of Israel. V.

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<strong>1 Peter 4:12-14;5:6-11</strong>
<p>In the final verses of the letter, the author exhorts his readers
(who are being persecuted at least to the extent of being made to feel
inferior) to accept their &#8220;ordeal&#8221; as something to be expected and as
testing their mettle. Christ is not just an example of
suffering-for-doing-good; they are to rejoice that in suffering they
actually share in his sufferings. This is preparation for union with
him when he comes again (&#8220;when his glory is revealed&#8221;, <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+4%3A13" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4:13</a>). They are indeed fortunate 
(&#8220;blessed&#8221;, <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+4%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4:14</a>)
that the Spirit, the source of oneness with God (&#8220;glory&#8221;) is with them.
For a Christian, to suffer for doing good is not a &#8220;disgrace&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+4%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4:16</a>). Their suffering is in fact 
the start of end-time judgement. How much worse off will be those who do not &#8220;obey&#8221;

entrust yourselves to God.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, the author addresses fellow &#8220;elders&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+5%3A1" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:1</a>) as one who shares in the 
certain hope of Christ&#8217;s return. He exhorts the leaders to: </p>
<ls>
<li>care for the faithful, </li>
<li>oversee them in doctrine and discipline, </li>
<li>treat them as equals, and </li>
<li>be examples to them.</li>
</ls>
<p> All the faithful must make effort to &#8220;humble yourselves&#8221;

before God, who is always the great deliverer and to whom you owe
obedience (&#8220;mighty hand&#8221;), so that in God&#8217;s time (&#8220;due time&#8221;) you will
be brought into full union with him.

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
