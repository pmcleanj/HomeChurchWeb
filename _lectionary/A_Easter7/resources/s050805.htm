<br>The Ascension account may be familiar but not always accessible to
many of us in the church. The occurrences of the past weeks have been
nothing less than astounding to the disciples (and to us, we hope), yet
the question posed by them betrays an equally astounding lack of vision
on their part. They are still hemmed in by the littleness of their
aspirations and expectations, longing for the restoration of the
Davidic monarchy and the glory of ancient Israel, the throwing off of
Roman oppression and the raising up of their own nationalistic glory.
And yet, we know that they stand on Mount Olivet, where Jesus was
arrested and taken to his death. They seem to be trying to make sense
of all that happened, beginning that dreadful night, by thinking in
terms that seemed possible, even though they had witnessed the
impossible right before their eyes. Their categories have been messed
up, and they aren&#8217;t able yet to think in fresh new ways.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Jesus
responds by re-directing their expectations and expanding their
horizons: he promises the Holy Spirit, and a ministry to the whole
world. Today, we hear many evangelists focus their preaching on
end-times, not on the work that the Spirit empowers us to do, here on
earth. But &#8220;the ends of the earth, not the end of the world, is the
theme of this book&#8221; (Michael E. Williams, The Storyteller&#8217;s Companion
to the Bible, Volume 12). It&#8217;s not enough to think in terms of our own
interests and hopes, the interests and hopes of our own people, no, now
Jesus opens up their hearts and minds to the Spirit that will come upon
them and give them power they have never known before so that they can
carry this good news to every corner of the earth, to every one of
God&#8217;s precious children. As in the Easter account, two men in white ask
them why they are just standing there, when there is so much to be
done. Transformation is in store, and it is not without a purpose, for
the world lies in waiting for this good news.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
earliest disciples, standing there on Mount Olivet, still trying to
make sense of everything that was happening to them, share with the
community of First Peter &#8211; and with us, today &#8211; the experience of
questioning and of needing to trust. The First Peter community was
experiencing persecution of some kind, suffering in any case, and they
are exhorted to trust God and to endure and to persist, knowing
themselves as blessed. Fear seizes us all at one time or another, yet
the writer tells us to "Cast all your anxiety on God, because God cares
for you." Henri Nouwen, in Making All Things New, writes about the
difference between our &#8220;occupations&#8221; and our &#8220;preoccupations&#8221;: "More
enslaving than our occupations, however, are our preoccupations. To be
pre-occupied means to fill our time and place long before we are there
&#8230; Much, if not most, of our suffering is connected with these
preoccupations&#8230;Since we are always preparing for eventualities, we
seldom fully trust the moment." </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
Whether you are questioning or whether you are experiencing persecution
and suffering, how do you trust the moment and trust God&#8217;s love and
care? What are the hard-to-make-sense-of experiences that your church
has had, that prompted questioning and even doubt? What suffering is
the story of your congregation, or what suffering have you experienced
because of your beliefs? What are the concrete expectations of the
people of your church, for today, and for the years ahead? What sense
have you made of the mysterious ways that <i><b>God is still speaking</b></i>, and still working, in your midst?

when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, is this the time
when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?" He replied, "It is not
for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own
authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." When he had said this, as they
were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their
sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven,
suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, "Men of
Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has
been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you
saw him go into heaven."

they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near
Jerusalem, a sabbath day&#8217;s journey away. When they had entered the
city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter,
and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and
Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of
James. All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer,
together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as
well as his brothers.

who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," he continued. "If we obey the
simplest, most fundamental, and difficult injunction of Scripture, we
will love one another, gay and straight."

Issues of gender and sexual orientation had not figured prominently in
the church&#8217;s long history of social activism. Riverside was linked with
civil rights, opposition to the war in Vietnam, and nuclear
disarmament. But, like a handful of other congregations in the United
Church of Christ in the mid-1980s, the members embarked upon the
process of education, dialogue and prayer involved in choosing whether
to be "Open and Affirming." And, as in those other congregations, that
process exposed significant differences&#8211;not only among the laity but
even within the clergy.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
But Bill Coffin was not going to back down&#8211;even on Mother&#8217;s Day. "What
is at stake," he declared, "is nothing less than the Gospel" Still, he
added, "If we are of one heart, we can ... be of two minds."
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
If his sermon had made clear Bill Coffin&#8217;s stand on the issue, it had
also summoned the congregation to continued open dialogue. As the date
for the special congregational meeting approached, representatives of
the opposing sides finally agreed upon wording they would submit to a
vote. The key sentence stated, "Because Lesbian/Gay persons are often
scorned by society and alienated from the church, we wish to reaffirm
that Lesbian/Gay persons are embraced within the membership of The
Riverside Church upon making the same affirmation of faith that all
other persons make; and that as members of the Body of Christ and The
Riverside Chruch, Lesbian/Gay people are expected and encouraged to
share in the liturgy, general life, employment and leadership of our
congregation."
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">   When the votes were counted, the "Statement of Openness, Inclusion, and 
Affirmation of Gay/Lesbian Persons" was adopted by a four-to-one margin, and 
Riverside became the first UCC church to adopt such a position.
    Today there are over 500 Open and Affirming congregations in the United 
Church of Christ.

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a
Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and
liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister
to read all of the lessons.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the
lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or
recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is
appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way.
The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with
refrains and music.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">During
Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first
option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture;
the second is thematically related to the other readings.</font></font></p><p>
