</P>
<P>To followers of Judaism, the created world is God&rsquo;s, so
faith and reason go hand in hand; learning about creation is learning
about God; reasoning is done in the context of God. They and we seek
knowledge of God as we pursue faith. In the last centuries BC, people
saw that the acquisition of knowledge about God led to wisdom. The
author of Sirach, Jesus ben Sira, understood wisdom as leading to
prosperity. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+1%3A1" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1:1</A>
says: &ldquo;all wisdom is from the Lord ...&rdquo;. In our reading,
ben Sira, has wisdom (abstracted, personified &ndash; but in a
metaphorical way) introduce herself &ldquo;in the midst of her
people&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A1" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1</A>),
Israel. She does so in the presence of the heavenly court (&ldquo;the
assembly ...&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>).
Wisdom &ldquo;came forth&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>)
by the word of God, and permeated the earth (&ldquo;like a mist&rdquo;)
as the spirit of God. She existed before creation. (Genesis <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+1%3A1-2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1:1-2</A>
says in a Jewish translation: <EM>At the beginning of God&rsquo;s
creating ... rushing-spirit of God hovering over the face of the
earth ...</EM>) Wisdom was involved in the &ldquo;pillar of cloud&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A4" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>),
the way God showed his presence during the Exodus. Wisdom is present
and active throughout creation, (from heaven to &ldquo;the depths of
the abyss&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">5</A>),
Sheol, the repose of the dead in Jewish thinking), and throughout
history, to all people and with them.</P>
<P>God commanded Wisdom to dwell among the people of Israel (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8</A>).
Her earthly residence is the Temple at Jerusalem, the home of Mosaic
Law; she gives rules for the appropriate worship of God (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>).
Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;beloved city&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>).
Wisdom &ldquo;took root&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>)
in Israel, inheritors of God&rsquo;s blessing. In vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Sirach+24%3A21-22" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">21-22</A>,
she concludes by offering an unusual meal, in which the more one
eats, the more one desires. Wisdom leads to godly living.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Jeremiah</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born
or began his ministry in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded
Assyria as the dominant power in the Middle East. He was a witness to
the return to worship of the Lord (instituted by the Judean king
Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death in battle in 609), the return
of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon captured Jerusalem in
587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be a prophet to
Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political and
religious convulsions. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Jeremiah 31:7-14</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jeremiah probably wrote this message of hope about 600 BC. Most of
his book is directed to the people of Judah (the southern kingdom,
conquered by Babylon in 587 BC) but this passage is directed to
Israel, the northern kingdom, which was at the time loosely subject
to Assyrian rule. Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A7-8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">7-8</A>
are a call for celebration. &ldquo;Jacob&rdquo; refers to Israel; the
&ldquo;chief of the nations&rdquo; means the <EM>foremost</EM>:
Israel is paramount because God cares about it. The &ldquo;land of
the north&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8</A>)
is Assyria. The people &ndash; even the &ldquo;blind and the lame&rdquo;
&ndash; will be gathered together, and will return from exile. (They
were deported in 722 BC.) Such a caravan crossing the Arabian desert
will indeed be a miraculous event.</P>
<P>Joy will be mixed with &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A9" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>)
and compassion (&ldquo;consolations&rdquo;). God will &ldquo;lead
them back&rdquo;, but (unlike in the first Exodus), the going will be
easy. Back then water was in short supply (recall that God caused
water to spring forth from a rock &ndash; Exodus 17:1-7), but this
time &ldquo;brooks&rdquo; will provide plentifully. Being Israel&rsquo;s
father, God will restore the nation to the state already enjoyed by
Judah. (&ldquo;Ephraim&rdquo; is part of Israel.) Other nations,
including the &ldquo;coastlands&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>)
of the Mediterranean, are invited to witness this marvellous
happening. In the first Exodus, God rescued Israel (&ldquo;ransomed
Jacob&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>)
and defeated their enemies (&ldquo;hands too strong&rdquo;); he will
do so again. When they return, they will celebrate God&rsquo;s
goodness with feasting (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A12" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12</A>).
They will be sad no longer. Per v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Jeremiah+31%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">14</A>,
the priests will have life and prosperity (&ldquo;fatness&rdquo;) as
will all &ldquo;my people&rdquo;. Bountiful harvests will mark the
start of this new era of well-being.</P>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 147:12-20</STRONG>

<P>This hymn is an invitation to praise God for his universal power
and providential care. In vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+147%3A1-11" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1-11</A>,
God is praised for rebuilding Jerusalem, gathering the people,
healing, creating, and providing for the needs of those he creates.

worship is due to him for protecting Jerusalem, for blessing her

the author says that wisdom has been God&rsquo;s agent in saving some
important people in the past. Wisdom was also active in saving the
people of Israel, through Moses. They are &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; in
that they are chosen and set apart by God. The &ldquo;nation of
oppressors&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Wisdom+of+Solomon+10%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>)

for its slavery with liberty, and precious objects carried on the
Exodus. The pillar of cloud both guided them and shielded them from

<P>Our reading begins immediately after Paul&rsquo;s greeting to his

hearts which are unseen and eternal, which bring together the

prosperity and peace.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">This
passage reminds us more of the poetry of Second Isaiah and his school
of disciples (Isa. 40&ndash;66) than of Jeremiah. It contains phrases
which are foreign to Jeremiah, especially the promise of beneficence
to the priests in vs. 14. On the other hand, the idea that Yahweh is
father to Israel, and Ephraim &quot;my firstborn son&quot; (vs. 9)
has parallels in 3:19 and 31:20. Scholarly consensus holds that it
comes from the early post-exilic period or even the years immediately
before the return from exile.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The main
thrust of the passage, however, presents a view of Yahweh as Lord not
only of Israel&rsquo;s history, but as sovereign over all nations.
This is an expression of biblical faith and theological conviction
which may be difficult for us to comprehend as we enter this
particularly difficult new year. Many will deny that God has taken
any initiative in the horrifying events of recent decades or
centuries. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">A flurry of
pessimistic <I>fin de si&egrave;cle</I> attitudes were widely
broadcast less than a decade ago when the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was
called the most violent in human history. It is true that many
millions of warriors and countless innocent civilians died in
incredibly brutal conflicts in the 1900s. This terrifying strife has
continued unabated into the new century. On the other hand, do we
have access to sufficiently accurate historical records to enable us
to describe any period as the most violent ever? </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Now we are
deeply involved in what could turn out the be a global economic
depression as severe as that of the 1930s. Daily the news seems only
to heighten our fears as more and more businesses and industries face
imminent collapse. Perhaps this is only our way of venting our horror
and moral outrage at what we are witnessing in our own time. In the
light of such despair as we are seeing, can we really believe that
God is in control of these events? Yet around the world many people
regard the coming inauguration of a new American administration as
offering hope at a time of great need.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The
beautiful poetry of this passage may have been composed as a
comforting message for a remnant of returning exiles more than 2500
years ago, but it has universal application. Divine love is
sovereign. The return of the remnant is being determined by what
Yahweh desires. Even the most vulnerable and marginalized will be
among them (vs. 8b). As a father leads his children along a straight,
smooth path (vs. 9) and as a shepherd gathers his flock scattered
across a hillside, so Yahweh will attend to the needs of Israel.
These metaphors speak eloquently of the master narrative of the whole
of the Jewish and Christian scriptures: the universe is in the hands
of a Loving Redeemer. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Early in
the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century as the maw of fratricidal war consumed

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">What a
marvellous message for this new year from the Lord of History!</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="PSALM 147:12-20"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>PSALM
147:12-20 </B>This liturgical hymn is another of the five hallelujah
psalms that close the Psalter. Like all the others, it resounds with
praise for Yahweh. While no one knows for sure, all five could have
been part of the New Year&rsquo;s liturgy in the temple. As an
antiphonal response to the previous lesson, this segment of the
second reading summons praise for what Yahweh has done for the
covenanted people, Israel. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Although it
now appears as a unit, the psalm probably originally consisted of
three separate shorter poems (vss. 1-6; 7-11; 12-20). The special
emphasis of this segment is the way Jerusalem in particular receives
greater security (vs. 13), peace and prosperity (vs. 14). Even then
it was recognized that if the capital city was safe, the whole nation
would benefit. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The poem
then cites various natural phenomena which bring specific beneficence
to Israel. All come as the direct gift of Yahweh. The snow, hoarfrost
and ice that melt in warm spring rains (vss. 16-18) may well be a
recollection from a particular winter season. These have significance
for the psalmist because they provide much needed moisture in the dry
climate of Israel where only a few inches of rain falls in a whole
year.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">No citation
of Yahweh&rsquo;s gifts to Israel would be complete without mention
of the law. So in vs. 19, we find &quot;statutes and ordinances,&quot;
synonyms for the law reminiscent of the later writings such as the
wisdom literature. Vs. 20 cites these as gifts Yahweh has given to no
other people. The corollary forms the second part of the poetic
parallelism: only Israel knows the law. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">This
emphasis on Israel&rsquo;s special privilege became the significant
national ideology after the time of Ezra in the 5<SUP>th</SUP>
century BCE. It has been the central myth of Jewish history ever
since. In the past several centuries, France, Britain, the United
States, Germany and Russia have all laid claim to similar myths. A
hundred year&rsquo;s ago, Canada&rsquo;s prime minister, Wilfrid
Laurier, made the bold claim that &quot;the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century
belongs to Canada.&quot; It did not turn out to be particularly true.
Perhaps every nation state needs a similar myth of aggrandizement to
encourage it in its immaturity. One recognizes the political
motivation of such myths. In the darkest period of World War II, King
George VI quoted a poet which contained a similar theme which gave
voice to a similar message of encouragement: </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><I>I said
to the man who stood at the gate of the year,<BR>&quot;Give me a
light that I may go forth into the unknown.&quot;<BR>And he said to
me, &quot;Go forth, put your hand into the hand of God.<BR>He shall
be to you better than a light, safer than a known way.</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="EPHESIANS 1:3-14"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>EPHESIANS
1:3-14</B> Scholarly debate continues unabated concerning the
authorship of the Ephesian letter. Perhaps the most radical
hypothesis is that of John C. Kirby, in his <I>Ephesians, Baptism and
Pentecost.</I> (McGill-Queen&rsquo;s University Press, 1968.) He
believed that &quot;the letter&quot; began as a baptismal liturgy and
sermon for Pentecost, probably at Ephesus, and was later transformed
into a general epistle from that community. Others view it as a
pseudonymous letter by someone who was steeped in Pauline theology,
but represented the ecclesiology and doctrine of the late lst or
early 2<SUP>nd</SUP> century. In <I>The Oxford Companion to the Bible</I>
Markus K. Barth wrote of it: &quot;In short, ... Ephesians is
considered, together with the Pastoral Epistles and Acts, to expound
what is called &lsquo;early Catholicism.&rsquo;&quot; Barth also
notes that detractors of the letter &quot;have dubbed it &quot;a
<I>Marseillaise</I> of church triumphalism.&quot; (Oxford University
Press, 1993).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">This
passage is perhaps the key to the whole letter. To quote Markus Barth
again: &quot;God&rsquo;s love has been poured out as an abundant
blessing; through grace and forgiveness Jews and gentiles now praise
God&rsquo;s glory.&quot; Kirby saw this hymn of praise as a Christian
rendition of the Jewish <I>berakah</I>, a prayer of blessing common
in many of the Psalms. He cites Psalm 105 as a good example. In the
Ephesian version of this type of prayer almost every phrase
celebrates what God has done through Christ. &quot;Every spiritual
blessing&quot; (vs. 3) is identified in a crescendo of enthusiasm as
the prayer proceeds. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Pauline
theological concepts such as election, adoption, redemption and
forgiveness all figure largely in this passage. Election occurred
before creation (vs. 4). Adoption came about through Jesus Christ
(vs. 5). Redemption and forgiveness resulted from the death of Christ
(vs. 7). All of this is the work of grace, &quot;freely bestowed ...
lavished upon us&quot; (vss. 6, 8). To those so blessed has been
revealed the mystery of God's eternal plan and purpose: to bring
together all creation under the sovereignty of Christ and so live to
praise God&rsquo;s glory (vss. 8b-12). How do we know this? We have
heard the gospel, and believing, we have been given the gift of God's
Holy Spirit as the assurance that God will keep this promise. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Along with
the gospel lesson from John 1 below, this reading presents a fully
rounded doctrine of the Incarnation, &quot;Why God became human?&quot;
in the words of Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109). Indeed, this may
well be the link between Pauline and Johannine theology, if it is as
many scholars believe, the product of a late lst century author. The
whole letter emphasizes the life in risen Christ in the Christian
community much more than his death and resurrection. The latter is by
no means neglected as the means by which we have been given the
spiritual gifts of the Christian life. Nonetheless, the redeemed life
now and forever in ordinary people is the central theme of the
author&rsquo;s praise and admonitions. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">This
emphasis lends credibility to Kirby&rsquo;s thesis that the baptism
of new converts at Pentecost was the occasion for the original
liturgy and sermon which subsequently became a letter. Vss. 13-14
provide one key reference to this occasion. Being &quot;marked with
the seal of the promised Holy Spirit&quot; as a &quot;pledge of our
inheritance&quot; can have only one meaning: it is a metaphor for
baptism. Very early in the history of the church, the practice of
&quot;sealing&quot; baptismal candidates by marking a cross with oil
on their foreheads became a normal part of the baptismal liturgy.
This charism symbolized the gift of the Spirit to the baptized for
the new life in Christ now beginning. The writer is holding up for
all others who read this letter the example of the Ephesian community
and the intensely spiritual meaning of this ritual.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="JOHN 1:10-18"></A><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica"><B>JOHN
1:10-18 </B>Once again the note of both continuity and discontinuity
with the religious tradition of Israel sounds through this passage,
as through the whole Gospel of John. Jesus is a man born into the
Jewish community of his time. John does not tell us, either by
proclamation or story, how this occurred. Instead, John tells us that
he is the transcendent and pre-existent One through whom both
creation and re-creation come into being (vs. 10-13). </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">His own
people to whom he came as one of them did not believe in him. To
those who did believe - then as now - has been revealed the ultimate
truth: Jesus, the Jew from Nazareth, is God's Word made flesh, the
source of life, the full revelation of divine glory, the one who
offers the gift of a new life to all who will accept it.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The <I>Word</I>
(in Greek, <I>Logos) </I>was a term John adopted from contemporary
Jewish literature, especially the work of Greek-speaking Jew, Philo
of Alexandria. The <I>Word</I> also closely paralleled the Jewish
concept of divine Wisdom. Throughout pre-exilic times, &quot;the word
of the Lord&quot; had been associated with prophetic inspiration. In
later Jewish literature divine Wisdom had appeared as personified,
and moreover, as a woman (cf. Proverbs 1-9). This personified Wisdom
of God also had a role in creation (Prov. 3:19; 8:22-31). The author
of the apocryphal book, <I>Sirach</I> (also known by its Latin name,
<I>Ecclesiasticus</I>) equated Wisdom with the creative word of God
and with <I>Torah</I>. To John <I>The Word</I> meant the gracious,
creative, self-revealed presence of God and of God's redemptive
purpose for all creation uniquely made known in Jesus, the man of
Nazareth. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">John went
further than regarding Jesus as a mere human endowed with special
gifts of wisdom. Nor was he a prophet, like Moses (vs. 17). All the
OT images of God have disappeared. No longer is Yahweh depicted as
almost human walking in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2-3) or speaking to
and through human prophets in authoritative ways. No longer are
aspects of divine character personified. The passage reads as if John
felt awed by the audacity of his own imagination. Here was an
entirely new revelation of truth and grace (vs. 16). More than that,
here is the God whom no one has ever seen. This Jesus, the Christ, is
God&rsquo;s only Son.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">In the
hushed silence of a gathered congregation attentive to every word
uttered by the reader, the words of this passage come as just that -
an entirely new revelation. &quot;The Word became flesh and lived
among us....From his fullness we have all received, grace upon
grace.&quot; He gives life - spiritual life lived in and through our
fleshly life - to all who will accept it. This faith statement has
become the heart of every creed since John penned it in the last
decade of the 1st century. Whether or not we believe it is the
crucial issue which each person must decide.</FONT></P>

is essentially a message of hope.&nbsp; It comes near the end of the
book of Jeremiah, which has consisted primarily of dire predictions
of the evil that would befall the nation of Judah because of their
refusal to follow the Mosaic covenant.&nbsp; But then, in chapters 30
and 31, a ray of hope bursts forth &ndash; the promise that, although
Judah will have to face exile and punishment for their refusal to
build a nation of political, economic and spiritual shalom, once
their punishment has brought about the desired humbling effect, they
will once again be restored to their beloved Promised Land.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo;For thus says the Lord: sing aloud with gladness for Jacob
and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise
and say, &ldquo;Save, O Lord, your people, the remnant of Israel&rdquo;.&nbsp;
See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather
them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and
the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great
company, they shall return here.&nbsp; With weeping they shall come,
and with consolations I will lead them back.&nbsp; I will let them
walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not
stumble; for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my
firstborn&rdquo; (vss. 7-9).</P>
<P>After the dark of the night, the day dawns!&nbsp; After the
suffering and ignominy of exile and slavery, freedom and restoration
comes!&nbsp; The nation of Judah will be freed and its political,
economic and religious leaders will be released from captivity and
returned to their liberated land.&nbsp; Israel&rsquo;s former
powerful and influential will return from exile, but also those who
are the most vulnerable (the blind, the lame, the pregnant).&nbsp;
The very fact that women will return pregnant from exile is an
indication that the nation has a future and a hope. God will lead
them back and will become a father to the people.&nbsp; That
miraculous return will be witness to both Israel and to the world
that God recognizes that they are family (although they were very
much at one time prodigal children; cf. Luke 15:11-32)), and so will
restore them because &ldquo;this son of mine was dead and is alive
again, he was lost and is found&rdquo; (Lk. 15:24).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>But the prophecy continues.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear the word of the
Lord, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; say, &ldquo;He
who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd
a flock&rdquo;.&nbsp; For the Lord has ransomed Jacob, and has
redeemed him from hands too strong for him.&nbsp; They shall come and
sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the
goodness of the Lord, over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over
the young of the flock and the herd; their life shall become like a
watered garden, and they shall never languish again.&nbsp; Then shall
the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old
shall be merry.&nbsp; I will turn their mourning into joy, I will
comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.&nbsp; I will give
the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied
with my bounty, says the Lord&rdquo; (vss. 10-14).</P>
<P>The focus now shifts from God&rsquo;s communication to Israel to
God&rsquo;s communication with all the nations of the world.&nbsp; It
is as if God is saying to the nations, &ldquo;Look and see what it is
like for a nation that makes Yahweh their God and who is willing to
live in justice, equity and in relationship with him.&nbsp; Look and
see how God loves his people and cares for them.&nbsp; For though
they have been punished for their commitment to power, greed and
domination (in imitation of the other nations of the world), once
Israel has seen the error of their ways and has repented, then God
will restore them to health and wholeness, abundance and wealth.&nbsp;
They will prosper (an abundance of grain, wine, oil, livestock).&nbsp;
They will live in joy and delight (the women dance, the young and old
men both make merry).&nbsp; They will be comforted by God.&nbsp; And
they &ndash; young and old, women and men, laity and clergy &ndash;
they will all experience the love and generosity of God!&nbsp; That
is the end of all those who truly receive God&rsquo;s grace and live
in obedience to God&rsquo;s call. 
</P>
<P><U><B>Psalm 147:12-20</B></U> is a hymn of praise that follows on
from Psalm 146.&nbsp; It praises God for his great love and power,
exercised for humanity.&nbsp; I am struck once again, in verses 1-6,
how the psalmist interposes the themes of the creative power of God
and God&rsquo;s commitment to the outcast and the powerless.&nbsp; It
is intriguing that, invariably, these are the two primary
characteristics of God lifted up by the psalmists.&nbsp; These are
the two godly elements that cause us to perceive and worship God as
God!&nbsp; Note the juxtapositions:</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of
Israel.&nbsp; He heals the brokenhearted, and binds up their wounds.&nbsp;
He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their
names. . . .&nbsp; The Lord lifts up the downtrodden; he casts the
wicked to the ground&rdquo; (147:2-4, 6).</P>
<P>One of the most beautiful metaphors in the Psalm is the author&rsquo;s
use of a horse and a runner to describe those who compete well and
are normally successful in life.&nbsp; The psalmist states that God
does not take delight in the success of the most competitive (the
&ldquo;winners&rdquo; or &ldquo;haves&rdquo; of society), but rather
takes delight in those who &ldquo;take pleasure&rdquo; in God.</P>
<P>&ldquo;His delight is not in the strength of the horse, nor his
pleasure in the speed of the runner; but the Lord takes pleasure in
those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love&rdquo;
(vss. 10-11).</P>
<P>The psalmist then ends this psalm with these words:&nbsp; &ldquo;Praise
the Lord, O Jerusalem!&nbsp; Praise your God, O Zion!&nbsp; For he
strengthens the bars of your gates; he blesses your children within
you.&nbsp; He grants peace within your borders; he fills you with the
finest of wheat.&nbsp; He sends out his command to the earth; his
word runs swiftly.&nbsp; He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost
like ashes.&nbsp; He hurls down hail like crumbs &ndash; who can
stand before his cold?&nbsp; He sends out his word, and melts them;
he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.&nbsp; He declares his
word to Jacob, his statutes and ordinances to Israel.&nbsp; He has
not dealt thus with any other nation; they do not know his
ordinances.&nbsp; Praise the Lord&rdquo; (vss. 12-20).</P>
<P>The psalmist completes this hymn of worship by using God&rsquo;s
creative work as the connecting tissue throughout the Psalm.&nbsp; In
the early part of the psalm, he had linked God&rsquo;s creative power
and God&rsquo;s commitment to the outcast and the powerless.&nbsp;
Now, he links God&rsquo;s creative power (&ldquo;he gives snow like
wool; he scatters frost like ashes; he hurls down hail like crumbs;
he makes his wind blow and the waters flow&rdquo;) and God&rsquo;s
commitment to create a nation of shalom (&ldquo;he strengthens the
bars of your gates; he blesses your children within you; he grants
peace within your borders; he fills you with the finest of wheat; he
declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and ordinances to Israel&rdquo;).&nbsp;
</P>
<P>The psalmist describes that shalom community that God is building
within Israel.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s shalom people are a people with a
strong defense against enemy attack (vs. 13a), a people whose
children live in contentment and freedom (13b), a people who
experience peace between each other (14a), who are economically
prosperous (14b), and who are living in a right relationship with God
(vs. 19).&nbsp; They are even a people who, living in shalom,
experience oneness with creation subdued and quieted before them
(vss. 15-18).&nbsp; In other words, the psalmist is describing Israel
as a shalom community politically (vss. 13-14a), economically (14b)
and religiously (vs. 19).&nbsp; Their systems, as well as they
themselves as a people and as individuals, are &ldquo;at-one&rdquo;
with God, each other and all creation.&nbsp; &ldquo;(God) has not
dealt thus with any other nation; they do not know his ordinances&rdquo;
(vs. 20a).&nbsp; Therefore, how else can God&rsquo;s people respond
but with the cry, &ldquo;Praise the Lord&rdquo; (vs. 20b)! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><U><B>John 1:1-18.</B></U></P>
<P>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.&nbsp; He was in the beginning with God.&nbsp;
All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing
came into being.&nbsp; What has come into being in him was life, and
the life was the light of all people.&nbsp; The light shines in the
darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it&rdquo; (John 1:1-5).</P>
<P>With these dramatic words, the Gospel of John begins its Christmas
story.&nbsp; But unlike Matthew and Luke that tells us of the birth
of Christ, John tells us about creation itself &ndash; and Jesus&rsquo;
relationship to that creation.&nbsp; Therefore, since it is the
&ldquo;third Christmas story&rdquo;, it is appropriate to study this
passage as the Gospel lesson for the Second Sunday in Christmastide.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Gospel of
John opens with identical words to Genesis 1:1 &ndash; &ldquo;In the
beginning&rdquo;.&nbsp; Through the Hebrew creation story runs a
profound theme, repeated eight times (Gen. 1:3-6 and 7, 9, 11, 14-15,
20-21, 24 and 26-30).&nbsp; That theme is &ldquo;And God said . . .
And it was so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Genesis tells us that God <I>spoke </I>the world into existence.&nbsp;
So, John is declaring the same truth.&nbsp; The Word &ndash; in Greek
&ldquo;<I>logos</I>, in Hebrew &ldquo;<I>dabar</I>&rdquo; &ndash; is
not just <I>a</I> word spoken by human beings.&nbsp; It is <I>the
</I>word, for the &ldquo;<I>dabar</I>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<I>logos</I>&rdquo;
is the conduit by which Yahweh invades humanity and writes sacred
history into our history.&nbsp; The &ldquo;<I>logos</I>&rdquo; of God
<I>is </I>God, the voice of God speaking the creation into life.&nbsp;
Without the Word, there is no world!</P>
<P>For whom is this Word intended?&nbsp; The Word, John is telling
us, is intended for the world.&nbsp; The Greek word used here for
&ldquo;world&rdquo; is &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo;.&nbsp; The cosmos is not
simply the geographical world &ndash; our sphere.&nbsp; The cosmos,
to the Greeks, was the entire created order, the universe.&nbsp; The
Word, John tells us, has entered the &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo; which God
created, bringing to that cosmos &ldquo;life&rdquo;, &ldquo;light&rdquo;
and &ldquo;power&rdquo;.</P>
<P>But how did the cosmos and its people respond?&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<I>cosmos </I>did not <I>know </I>him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His own
<I>people </I>did not <I>accept </I>him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rejection of
the Word (and therefore of God) occurred at two levels &ndash;
societally (i.e., the cosmos) and individually (i.e., people).&nbsp;
The &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo; and its &ldquo;people&rdquo; had refused to
come into an intimate relationship with its creator because
&ldquo;darkness&rdquo; had kept it and its people from the &ldquo;light&rdquo;.</P>
<P>However, such rejection of the Word is not universal.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
to all who received (the Word) . . . he gave power to become children
of God&rdquo; (1:12).&nbsp; There are those who have responded to the
Word and have become right with God.&nbsp; But how do they do that,
John asks?</P>
<P>God&rsquo;s people are to be shaped around their embracing of the
free gift of God&rsquo;s redemptive love (1:13), and making that
&ldquo;amazing grace&rdquo; the foundation for their life together.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;shalom&rdquo;, the &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo; as God
intended it to be will come into existence through &ldquo;all who
received him, who believed in his name&rdquo; and who therefore
create together a new community, an alternative society built upon
God&rsquo;s love and grace.</P>
<P>The magnificent prologue of the Gospel of John now rushes toward
its climax, as it gives to the reader the essential theme of the
remainder of the Gospel of John.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<I>The Word became flesh&rdquo;.&nbsp; </I>The Word &ndash;
the &ldquo;<I>dabar</I>&rdquo; of God, the &ldquo;<I>logos</I>&rdquo;
of God, has become an actual, living human being.&nbsp; The Word
&ldquo;lives&rdquo; among us within a human being!&nbsp; The Son of
God, the enfleshment of the &ldquo;Word&rdquo;, is journeying through
the human experience, John is telling us, as the personification of
&ldquo;grace and truth&rdquo;.</P>
<P>But what does John mean by &ldquo;grace and truth&rdquo;?&nbsp;
What John is doing here is using two Greek words to capture the
essence of one Hebrew word &ndash; &ldquo;<I>chesedh</I>&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<I>Chesedh</I>&rdquo; is the depth of God&rsquo;s love
expressed towards us, a love that accepts us as we are and yet calls
us to become all that we have the potential that God has created us
to be.&nbsp; And now John is telling us that God has &ldquo;tabernacled&rdquo;
(the actual meaning of the Greek) among us so that we might become
God&rsquo;s people as we live out &ldquo;<I>chesedh</I>&rdquo; in
both our private and public lives and in the very ways we carry out
the political, economic and religious functions of our society.</P>
<P>Now the Prologue reaches its climax.&nbsp; It names the &ldquo;Word&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;father&rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth&rdquo; is
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;The law indeed was given through Moses;
grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:17).</P>
<P>God&rsquo;s &ldquo;<I>chesedh</I>&rdquo; is not going to come to
humanity and the &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo; any longer through &ldquo;Moses&rdquo;
(that is, the Jewish political, economic and religious system).&nbsp;
The Law created by God to incarnate God in humanity&rsquo;s
structures has become the exact opposite, for it has become the
oppressive system of the first century that is designed to maintain
power for the few while holding the populace in economic, political
and religious slavery.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Law&rdquo; has become so
exploitive and dominating that it is beyond redemption.</P>
<P>But &ldquo;grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&rdquo;.&nbsp;
God has had to find another way.&nbsp; And that way is Jesus!</P>
<P>What John is proposing here is radically revolutionary.&nbsp; Is
he right?&nbsp; The remainder of the Gospel According to St. John is
his effort to demonstrate through the life and ministry, the death
and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth the authenticity of what he has
here proposed.&nbsp; And it is to demonstrate that authenticity
against the landscape of the horrendous oppression of the Jewish and
Roman systems!&nbsp; This is the magnificent Christmas story of the
Gospel of St. John.</P>
<P><U><B>Ephesians 1:3-14</B></U> is the Epistle lesson for the
Second Sunday of Christmastide.&nbsp; In its Greek original,
Ephesians 1:3-14 is one long sentence!&nbsp; Consequently, it is a
single thought meant to introduce this entire letter.&nbsp; In other
words, Ephesians 1:3-14 is the &ldquo;executive summary&rdquo; of
this essay, in which Paul tells us what it is he is going to tell us
more thoroughly throughout this letter.</P>
<P>In this section, Paul reviews what it is that God has done for
us.&nbsp; He does so in a most succinct manner (even though it is all
one lengthy sentence).&nbsp; Further, he then states why it is that
God has done what he has done for us.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look at that
list.</P>
<P>First, God &ldquo;<I><B>blessed</B></I> us in Christ, with every
spiritual blessing&rdquo; (1:3).</P>
<P>Second, God &ldquo;<I><B>chose</B></I> us before the foundation of
the world&rdquo; (1:4).</P>
<P>Third, God &ldquo;<I><B>adopted</B></I> (us) as his children
through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:5).</P>
<P>Fourth, God &ldquo;<I><B>redeemed</B></I>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<I><B>forgave</B></I>&rdquo;
us through Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work (vss. 7-8).</P>
<P>Fifth, God has &ldquo;<I><B>made know to us </B></I>the mystery of
<I><B>his will</B></I>&rdquo; (i.e., what we are called to do as
God&rsquo;s people) (1:9).</P>
<P>Sixth, God has &ldquo;<I><B>marked (us) with </B></I>the seal of
<I><B>his Holy Spirit</B></I>&rdquo; (1:13).</P>
<P>Thus, Paul is telling us that everyone of us as Christians and all
of us as the Body of Christ have been blessed, chosen, adopted,
redeemed, forgiven, have come to know God&rsquo;s will and are marked
with the Holy Spirit!&nbsp; God has given all of this to us through
the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But why has God done this work in each of us and in all of us as
Christians?&nbsp; Why has God blessed, chosen, adopted, redeemed,
forgiven, called, baptized us and filled us with God&rsquo;s Spirit?&nbsp;
This introduction to the book of Ephesians now reaches its apex of
intention.&nbsp; God has done this great work within each of us and
all of us, Paul writes, so that we, as God&rsquo;s adopted family,
might participate in God&rsquo;s &ldquo;plan for the fullness of
time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on
earth&rdquo; (1:10), so that we &ldquo;might live for the praise of
his glory&rdquo; (1:12).</P>
<P>God has worked in us as individuals and as a community of faith in
the ways Paul describes in this passage in order that we might live
out in the world the work that Jesus intends to do through God
(&ldquo;things in heaven&rdquo;) and through us (&ldquo;things on
earth&rdquo;).&nbsp; But what does Paul mean by &ldquo;things in
heaven and things on earth?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Because this passage is the &ldquo;executive summary&rdquo; of the
entire book of Ephesians, Paul will spend much of the remainder of
that book in defining &ldquo;things in heaven and things on earth&rdquo;
and our obligations towards them.&nbsp; Paul, as a first century
person, believed that the spirit world (&ldquo;things in heaven&rdquo;)
and the physical world (&ldquo;things in earth&rdquo;) were closely
link.&nbsp; This is caught up in Paul&rsquo;s theology of the
&ldquo;principalities and powers&rdquo; that is developed throughout
the books of Ephesians and Colossians.</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s theology of &ldquo;the principalities and powers&rdquo;
is built on the premise that what happens in the spirit world has its
counterpart on earth, and what happens on earth impacts heaven.&nbsp;
Therefore, the principalities and powers are, at one and the same
time, both spiritual and earthly, with the spiritual dimension of
that power providing the spiritual dimension and unique power of any
earthly system!&nbsp; Therefore, we need to understand that <I>every
</I>reference in Ephesians to &ldquo;principalities and powers&rdquo;
or &ldquo;heaven and earth&rdquo; is a reference both to the Roman
Empire and to the dark spiritual forces controlling and shaping and
driving the Roman Empire!</P>
<P>Thus, in Ephesians 1:10, Paul&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;(God&rsquo;s)
plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things
in heaven and things on earth&rdquo; is not rhetoric to Paul.&nbsp;
It is his code for the political, economic and religious institutions
of earth &ndash; and especially of Rome &ndash; and their matching
&ldquo;principalities and powers&rdquo; in the heavens (cf. Col.
1:15-16).</P>
<P>Since Paul means here the systems of the government, of the
marketplace and of religion, what is he saying that the church is
called to do?&nbsp; What he is stating is that the church is to be
active in participating on the side of God in challenging the systems
here on earth, even as the angels wage comparable war in the
heavens.&nbsp; What Paul is declaring is that <I><B>the church is to
be involved in public life as its essential mission!&nbsp; </B></I>And
that is why God has &ldquo;blessed, chosen, adopted, redeemed,
forgiven, made known his will, and given us the Holy Spirit&rdquo; &ndash;
so that we could be God&rsquo;s agents in the world, working through
the politics, economics and social systems of that society to
transform it into the kingdom of God!</P>
