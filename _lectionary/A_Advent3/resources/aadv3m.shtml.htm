<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<strong>Isaiah 35:1-10</strong>
<p>In this oracle of restoration, the prophet promises: </p>
<ls>
<li>restoration of the land to fertility </li>
<li>the end of human suffering and infirmity </li>
<li>restoration of hope and justice and </li>
<li>the joyful return of the exiles from captivity.</li>
</ls>
<p> The prophet has predicted the destruction of the nations,
particularly of Edom, and the devastation of their lands. (Edom was
thought to have aided the Babylonians in capturing Jerusalem.) The
other lands will be laid waste, rendered unproductive and given over to
wild beasts (in Chapter <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+34" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">34</a>). Now, in contrast, exiled Israel 
will be restored. The &#8220;desert shall ... blossom&#8221; (v.

will be given to Israel as a sign of God&#8217;s favour and glory. (The Plain
of Sharon, extending from the Mediterranean coast to the Carmel range
of mountains, was then covered with dense oak forest, as was much of
Lebanon.) The land which had once been given over to wild beasts

and barren land will bloom.</p>

Finally, the exiles, those taken captive to Babylon, will return on a &#8220;Holy Way&#8221; (v.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 146:5-10</strong>

<em>Hallelujah</em> Psalm, a series of hymns of praise which close out
the Psalter. Each hymn includes a call to worship, a statement of the
purpose for praising God, and a renewed summons to praise. These Psalms
all begin and end with the word <em>Hallelujah</em> (in the NRSV, translated as &#8220;Praise the L<small>ORD</small>&#8221;).</p>
<p>In contrast to human rulers, who ultimately disappoint (vv.

<small><br>
<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Three gospels in the New Testament offer similar portraits of the life of Jesus; 
Luke is the third of them. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied
Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), 
a collection of sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a 
gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, 
sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke 
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily 
for Gentiles.

<b>James</b>
</small><p>
<small>Although James opens like a letter, it is an exhortation to ethical conduct. 
Christians find themselves in an alien world, full of immorality and evil; 
they are called to a faith that is not merely theoretical or abstract, but acted 
upon, in every aspect of their lives. In a situation where trials and tribulations 
abound, and where the poor suffer at the hands of the rich, the author exhorts 
them to joy, endurance, wisdom, confident prayer and faithful response to the 
liberating word of God, as they await the second coming of the Lord. The 
recipients appear to be a group of Jewish-Christian communities outside Palestine. 
Traditionally, the Church has seen the author of this book as James, the brother of 
our Lord; however, its excellent Greek style, late acceptance into the canon, and 
absence of concerns about ritual purity suggest another author. The author seems 
to have written in the name of James, thus giving the book authority.

<hr>
<strong>James 5:7-10</strong>
<p>Early Christians expected the return of Jesus, the <em>second coming</em>,
almost immediately. This was connected with expectations about the
Kingdom of God. The apparent delay of this event caused some
difficulties and even some disputes among the faithful. James warns his
readers not to be impatient (vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=James+5%3A8-9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8-9</a>), lest this impatience lead to 
grumbling and division within the church (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=James+5%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>), which will bring judgement. For 
with the second coming of Christ comes also the judgement of God. The second coming is a <em>two-edged sword</em>: its arrival is both of comfort and of warning to Christians!</p>
<p>Instead, James tells his readers that they are to be patient in suffering like the prophets (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=James+5%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>). They are to bide their time 
like the farmer who plants his crop in the knowledge that the rains will come in their own time (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=James+5%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>).
(In Palestine, there are two rainy times of the year: October-November,
&#8220;early&#8221; and April-May, &#8220;late&#8221;.) So it is with the Kingdom. It is on its
way, it is &#8220;near&#8221;, (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=James+5%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>) but will come in its own time. Our 
impatience will not hasten its coming, but we can expect it with the confidence of faith.</p>

<b>Matthew</b>

<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)

<strong>Matthew 11:2-11</strong>
<p>John the Baptist has been arrested and imprisoned. Discouraged and
in doubt, he sends messengers to ask Jesus: &#8220;Are you the one ...?&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A3" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3</a>) But Jesus does not simply say 
<em>yes</em>. Instead, he points John (and the crowd) to the signs of the Kingdom (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>).
Echoing Isaiah, he points out that the blind, the deaf, the lame and
the lepers are being healed and good news is given to the poor. Anyone
can claim to be a herald of the kingdom, but only in the presence of
the Messiah will the true signs of the Kingdom be evident. These are
not mere claims, but incontrovertible proof. Yet apparently there are
some who take offense at Jesus (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>).
Perhaps even John himself has been disappointed because his
expectations of the Messiah do not seem to be fulfilled by Jesus, e.g.
he does not &#8220;wear soft robes&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">8</a>). Perhaps this has given rise to 
doubts. Jesus refers to the signs of the Kingdom in Isaiah. John is &#8220;more than a prophet&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>)
for he heralds the dawn of the final era of history and announces the
coming of the Kingdom. Now Jesus validates John&#8217;s ministry as a true
prophet (by quoting a prophecy from Malachi, v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A10" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">10</a>), going on even to identify 
John as Elijah (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A14" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">14</a>).
(Jews understood the time of the prophets to have ended, but took
Malachi&#8217;s words to mean that Elijah would come again.) Jesus criticizes
the people who went out to see John the Baptist in the wilderness with
a variety of incorrect expectations. What they actually saw was greater
than they could have imagined. Yet even John, as great as he was, only
pointed the way to an even greater reality (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Matthew+11%3A11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">11</a>). Up to and including John the 
Baptist was the time of prophetic promise; now this promise is starting to be fulfilled (v.
