				<P>Along with being one of my favorite seasons, I find the season
				of Advent as one of high stress.&nbsp; We live in a world where
				the great communicator of the internet is causing us in reality
				to become more and more isolated.&nbsp; Increasingly we are
				surrounded by four walls as studies show we are spending more
				time at work and less at home.&nbsp; And when we are home, we are
				doing more and more things that are work related keeping us in
				the four walls of our house.&nbsp; Our connection to the outside
				world is often relegated to what we read and hear from the media,
				and we know that is inherently biased with either a conservative
				or liberal spin.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Yes, many feel confined and
				disconnected in a world of uncertainty.&nbsp; The business of
				this season, the sad remembrances of the death of loved ones, the
				loneliness that some people feel can lead to doubt and despair.&nbsp;
				If this weren&rsquo;t enough, we are a world at war.&nbsp; We are
				at war with terrorists and with Iraq.&nbsp; The news and our
				recent election would suggest that we are at war with one another
				over what we define as moral issues.&nbsp; We doubt whether our
				neighbor sees Jesus in the same way that we do.&nbsp; Because of
				this, we too may wonder who Jesus really is in our lives.&nbsp;
				During this season of hope, it may sound strange to talk about
				doubt but clearly doubt and hope have their place this Advent.</P>
				<H4>Link to the Gospel Reading</H4>
				<P>Our Gospel comes to bring us hope in this story of a person
				who wavers between roles.&nbsp; We can find hope because this
				story of John the Baptizer reflects our human experience.&nbsp;
				Our faith experience is one of journeying back and forth between
				doubt and certainty, between despair and hope. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				As John sits within the four walls of prison he is hearing about
				the deeds of Christ.&nbsp; Jesus has done many great things in a
				very short time, but none of these deeds seem to have helped
				John.&nbsp; He is in prison, he will die in prison.&nbsp; There
				are no miracles coming his way from the one he called &ldquo;more
				powerful.&rdquo;&nbsp; John proclaimed the one coming after him
				to not only be more powerful, but also greater.&nbsp; John says
				of the Messiah, I am not worthy to carry his sandals.<BR>&nbsp;
				<BR>John may not have been so surprised that he ended up in
				prison.&nbsp; Many prophets before him had found themselves in
				similar circumstances.&nbsp; But, something was missing for this
				one who baptized with water.&nbsp; John believed the Messiah
				would come and baptize with fire.&nbsp; Part of that fire likely
				would have looked like military might.&nbsp; Yet, as John sits in
				the walls of prison, doubt comes to him.&nbsp; Rather than fire,
				Jesus comes and is baptized with water by John.&nbsp; Rather than
				clearing his threshing floor with a winnowing fork, Jesus points
				to what is seen and heard from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blind
				receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
				deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news
				brought to them.&rdquo; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>What do we miss because we
				expect things to go a certain way?&nbsp; Do we doubt our children
				will be successful because their talents are different than ours
				and we don&rsquo;t understand them?&nbsp; Do we doubt our
				neighbor&rsquo;s faith because they pull out things from the
				Gospel that we think are less important, or that miss the point
				completely?&nbsp; Do we doubt that we can find happiness in this
				season because we have lost a loved one, have less money to
				spend, have stopped believing in Santa Claus and are just too
				tired to face the season with all its expectation and hype?&nbsp;
				Do we doubt Jesus thinking to ourselves, &ldquo;What has he done
				for me lately?&rdquo;&nbsp; <BR><BR>Jesus didn&rsquo;t come as
				John expected him.&nbsp; John asks of Jesus, &ldquo;Are you the
				one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?&rdquo;&nbsp;
				We may ask a similar question of Jesus, &ldquo;In a day when
				there are so many voices and signs, which ones point to you
				Jesus?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus response to John and his disciples is
				to tell John what they see Jesus has done.&nbsp; And then, Jesus
				talks about what John has done for those who sought him out.&nbsp;
				John we are told was more than a prophet.&nbsp; We are more than
				what our culture tells us we are.&nbsp; We are more than our job,
				our toys, our looks, our role.&nbsp; We are children of God,
				inheritors of the Kingdom.</P>
				<H4>Link to the First Reading</H4>
				<P>As we have become more and more isolated, I believe Isaiah
				becomes more and more a relevant book for us.&nbsp; In a sense we
				have been exiled from community by the push toward
				individualism.&nbsp; I have a friend who blames the loss of
				community in the Midwest to the invention of the air
				conditioner.&nbsp; While before on hot humid days, people would
				be meeting under the shade of the neighborhood tree, now people
				go to the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp; No longer are people
				drinking lemonade under the Old Oak tree.&nbsp; We are a
				dispersed people.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage from
				Isaiah seeks to give voice to the exiled.&nbsp; The final line of
				verse 10 catches the feel for the whole poem.&nbsp; Sorrow and
				sighing or another interpretation of the Hebrew, sorrow and
				groaning shall flee away.&nbsp; The promise is for everlasting
				joy and singing shall return.&nbsp; A word study shows that the
				same word for sighing or groaning is the word used for woman
				during childbirth.&nbsp; I have heard many women claim that they
				have done more of the latter during childbirth.&nbsp; The hope is
				found that the ransomed of the Lord shall return and community
				will be found again.&nbsp; The four walls in these verses are put
				up because of the separation from the community that comes
				together to worship God.&nbsp; The hope is found in a savior who
				with Christian eyes we see is the one who restores sight to the
				blind, hearing to the deaf, walking to the lame, speech to the
				mute.</P>
				<H4>Link to the Second Reading</H4>
				<P>James is talking to his community that expects that the advent
				of God&rsquo;s judgment is at hand.&nbsp; James expects this
				judgment to vindicate the poor and to punish the rich.&nbsp;
				These words are of comfort for the community that is being
				persecuted.&nbsp; The pastoral word is for those in need of
				strength to last the time of trial.&nbsp; Here is a call of
				patience and toward lifting one up in community.&nbsp; For those
				who are disgruntled, their anger should be directed toward God
				who can hear it and not toward one another.</P>
