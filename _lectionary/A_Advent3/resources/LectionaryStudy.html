preparation before experiencing Christ's birth into the world through

Secular preparations for Christmas are in full swing: presents being
bought, cookies being baked, decorations being hung. How are our
spiritual preparations coming? Do we need to &ldquo;dig in&rdquo;
more for the next two weeks? How many praying days are left until
Christmas?</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><I><SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost.<BR><SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a
public example, was minded to put her away privily.<BR><SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in
her is of the Holy Ghost.<BR><SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she
shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he
shall save his people from their sins.<BR><SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet, saying,<BR><SUP>23</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold,
a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
us. </I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
