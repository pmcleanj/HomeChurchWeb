<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<hr>
<strong>Isaiah 50:4-9a</strong>
<p>The part of Isaiah written in exile (Chapters 40-55) contains four 
<em>servant songs</em>, sections that interrupt the <em>flow</em> of the book 
but have a unity within themselves. The first (42:1-7) begins &#8220;Here is my 
servant, whom I uphold, my chosen ...&#8221;; in the second (49:1-7) the 
servant, abused and humiliated, is commissioned anew; in the third (our 
passage) he is disciplined and strengthened by suffering; and in the fourth 
(52:17-53:12) even the Gentiles are in awesome contemplation before the 
suffering and rejected servant. In late Judaism, he was seen as the perfect 
Israelite, one of supreme holiness, a messiah. In the gospels, Jesus identifies 
himself as the servant (or slave), the one who frees all people.</p>
<p>In vv. 4-6, God has &#8220;opened my ear&#8221;; he has commissioned the 
servant as one who is taught, i.e. like a disciple. God has made him a 
&#8220;teacher&#8221; (a prophet) of the &#8220;word&#8221; of God, to bring 
God&#8217;s comfort to &#8220;the weary&#8221;, his fellow Israelites &#8211; 
who reject God. He has accepted this command: he is not 
&#8220;rebellious&#8221;. They have tortured him (v. 6), as they did prophets 
before him, but he has accepted their &#8220;insult and spitting&#8221;.</p>
<p>In vv. 7-9a, in courtroom language, the servant says that, because God helps 
him, he is not disgraced; he confidently accepts the suffering (&#8220;set my 
face like flint&#8221;), and will not be put to shame. God will prove him right 
(&#8220;vindicates&#8221;, v. 8). He is willing to face his 
&#8220;adversaries&#8221;, his accusers &#8211; for the godly to &#8220;stand 
up together&#8221; with him against the ungodly. He is confident that, with 
God&#8217;s help, none will declare him guilty.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<hr>
<strong>Psalm 31:9-16</strong>
<p>The psalmist seeks deliverance from personal enemies. He is &#8220;in 
distress&#8221;: his troubles have led to ill health; his strength fails him 
(v. 10); perhaps he is terminally ill. He is &#8220;scorned by all ... [his] 
enemies&#8221; (v. 11a, Revised English Bible) and even by his neighbours; his 
friends avoid him. People forget about him, as though he is already dead (v. 
12); he feels as useless as &#8220;something thrown away&#8221; (New English 
Bible). People are conducting a whispering campaign against him and they scheme 
to take his life (v. 13); but he accepts God personally; he has confidence in 
God (v. 14). His destiny (&#8220;times&#8221;, v. 15) is safe in God&#8217;s 
hands; he trusts that God will deliver him from his adversaries and 
persecutors. Seeing himself as a &#8220;servant&#8221; (v. 16), he cries 
<em>let me experience you, O God!</em> May God, in his compassion, save him 
from all that besets him. In vv. 21-24 (perhaps written later), he gives thanks 
to God for hearing his call for help. God&#8217;s unfailing love for him in his 
distress was wonderful. May his experience be an example for others.</p>

<b>Philippians</b>
</small><p>
<small>Paul wrote to the church at Philippi, a prosperous Roman colony in northern Greece, from prison. We
do not know whether this imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome. It appears that he was held under
house arrest. It is possible that the epistle is actually made up of three letters. It contains many personal
references, exhorts members of the Philippian church to live the Christian life and to good ethical
conduct,  introduces Timothy and Epaphroditus as his representatives, and warns against legalists and
libertines. Lastly, he thanks the Philippian community for their material support.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Philippians 2:5-11</strong>
<p>In vv. 1-4, Paul has urged the Christians at Philippi, through 
&#8220;encouragement in Christ&#8221;, and moved by God&#8217;s love for them, 
to &#8220;be of the same mind[set], having the same love, being in full accord 
...&#8221;. They are to &#8220;regard others as better than ... 
[themselves]&#8221;, freely adopting a lowly, unassertive stance before others, 
replacing self-interest with concern for others.</p>
<p>Vv. 5-11 are an early Christian hymn to which Paul has added v. 8b. He 
exhorts his readers to be of the same mindset as Jesus &#8211; one that is 
appropriate for them, given their existence &#8220;in Christ&#8221; (v. 5). 
Christ was &#8220;in the form of God&#8221; (v. 6): he was already like God; he 
had a God-like way of being, e.g. he was not subject to death. He shared in 
God&#8217;s very nature. Even so, he did not &#8220;regard&#8221; being like 
God &#8220;as something to be exploited&#8221;, i.e. to be grasped and held on 
to for his own purposes. Rather, he &#8220;emptied himself&#8221; (v. 7), made 
himself powerless and ineffective - as a slave is powerless, without rights. He 
took on the likeness of a human being, with all which that entails (except 
sin), including &#8220;death&#8221; (v. 8). As a man, he lowered 
(&#8220;humbled&#8221;) himself, and throughout his life in the world, was 
fully human and totally obedient to God, even to dying. (Paul now adds: even to 
the most debasing way of dying, crucifixion &#8211; reserved for slaves and the 
worst criminals.)</p>
<p>God actively responded to this total denial of self, his complete <em>living 
and dying for others</em>, by placing him above all other godly people 
(&#8220;highly exalted him&#8221;, v. 9), and bestowing on him the name, title 
and authority of &#8220;Lord&#8221; (v. 11) over the whole universe 
(&#8220;heaven&#8221;, v. 10, &#8220;earth&#8221;, &#8220;under the 
earth&#8221;). God has given him authority which, in the Old Testament, he 
reserved for himself. (Isaiah 45:22-25, in the Revised English Bible, says: 
&#8220;From every corner of the earth turn to me and be saved; for I am God ... 
to me every knee shall bow ... to me every tongue shall swear, saying &#8216;In 
the Lord alone are victory and might ... all Israel&#8217;s descendants will be 
victorious and will glory in the L<small>ORD</small>&#8217;&#8221;); everyone 
shall worship him; confessing that &#8220;Jesus Christ is Lord&#8221; (v. 11) 
is equivalent to proclaiming the victory and might of God. The ultimate goal is 
the &#8220;glory of God the Father&#8221;, the reclamation of God&#8217;s 
sovereignty, his power over, and presence in, the universe.</p>

<small><br>
<b>Luke</b>
</small><p>
<small>Luke is the third synoptic (or quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. 
Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his 
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a collection of 
sayings (known as Q for <em>Quelle</em>) and his own source. It is a gospel that emphasizes 
God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and 
lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses 
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily for Gentiles.

<em>Note: Either Luke 22:14-23:56 or Luke 23:1-49 may be read.</em>
<hr>
<strong>Luke 22:14-23:56</strong>
<p>Jesus and his &#8220;apostles&#8221; are gathered in a room on the second 
floor of a house in Jerusalem. It would be a guest room, furnished with rugs, 
cushions and perhaps a low table. 22:13 says &#8220;... they went and found 
everything as he had told them ...&#8221;, so they are confident that what he 
now promises will really happen. The &#8220;hour&#8221; (22:14) is both the 
time of the meal &#8211; after sundown &#8211; and the time of completion of 
his <em>rescue mission</em>. Jesus begins his farewell speech to his followers 
with the Last Supper. (The name comes from 1 Corinthians 11:20, &#8220;the 
Lord&#8217;s supper&#8221;.) He thinks of this meal as pointing forward to the 
banquet in the kingdom of God (22:17-18). The traditional prayer of thanks over 
the cup is <em>Blessed are you, Lord our God, king of the world, who has 
created the fruit of the vine.</em> Throughout the speech, Jesus continues to 
teach, to prepare his followers for their mission in the world. Some Jewish 
meals began with sharing a common cup of wine, and drinking another after the 
meal (22:20). Jesus again gives &#8220;thanks&#8221; (22:19): the Greek word, 
<em>eucharistesas</em>, gives us the word <em>Eucharist</em>. The &#8220;loaf 
of bread&#8221; was likely a flat cake of leavened bread. Jews to this day 
bless the bread and break it, but Jesus says something special: &#8220;This is 
my body&#8221; God gives to free us from sin.</p>
<p>That his body is to be broken may indicate that he expects to be stoned, 
(crucifixion did not necessarily involve breaking bones.) He commands the 
disciples to &#8220;do this&#8221;. Again, &#8220;poured&#8221; (22:20) points 
to death by stoning: such deaths were bloody while crucifixion was not. He 
inaugurates a &#8220;new covenant&#8221;, a new bond between God and humankind. 
(In Exodus 24:3-8, Moses binds the people to the old covenant by dashing blood 
on them.) Jesus gives his followers the Eucharist as a continuing remembrance 
of his sacrifice for humankind. In 22:21-22, Jesus foretells that one of the 
twelve will betray him. This is part of God&#8217;s plan; even though God has 
&#8220;determined&#8221; it, Judas&#8217; fate will be horrible!</p>
<p>In 22:24-27, Jesus talks about what it is to be a leader in the Church. 
Hellenistic kings were called &#8220;benefactors&#8221; (22:25) while in fact 
they <em>lorded it</em> over the people, but leadership in the Christian 
community is different: leaders are to adopt Jesus&#8217; style of leadership, 
to recognize that their talents as leaders are gifts from God, and that they 
are to serve all in need. Jesus bequeaths (&#8220;confer&#8221;, 22:29) to 
those who have shared in his &#8220;trials&#8221; (22:28) membership in the 
Kingdom of God. They will join with him in showing to the <em>new Israel</em>, 
the Church (&#8220;the twelve tribes of Israel&#8221;, 22:30) that God is 
right, and share in proclaiming the fulfilment of God&#8217;s promises to 
humankind.</p>
<p>In 22:31, Jesus calls Peter &#8220;Simon&#8221;, the name he had before 
becoming a disciple. This verse may look odd, but God placed Job in the hands 
of the devil, to determine his worth: see Job 1:12; 2:6. Jesus has prayed for 
Peter&#8217;s constancy but he predicts, in spite of Peter&#8217;s statement 
(22:33), that Peter will deny knowing Jesus. After his denial, when he returns 
to Christ, leader that he is, Peter is to use his experience to deepen the 
faith of the others (22:32)</p>
<p>In 10:4, Jesus has sent out the seventy to do his mission &#8220;without a 
purse, bag or sandals&#8221; (22:35), but times have changed: his followers 
must now be prepared for suffering, and even for death (&#8220;sword&#8221;, 
22:36), in carrying out his commission. In 22:37, Jesus foretells that he will 
fulfil Isaiah 53:12 (part of a <em>Servant Song</em>): he will be considered a 
criminal &#8211; and so will his followers, but they take him literally 
(&#8220;two swords&#8221;, 22:38).</p>
<p>Jesus now leaves the house and walks to the garden on the &#8220;Mount of 
Olives&#8221; (22:39), across the Kidron Valley from Jerusalem. (21:37 tells us 
of previous visits.) The twelve, and probably other followers, go with him. 
There he prays for those with him, that they may not be faced with the struggle 
between God and the devil (22:40) expected to precede the coming of the 
Kingdom. Usually people stood to pray, but Jesus kneels in humility (22:41).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, a &#8220;cup&#8221; (22:42) refers to an action in 
God&#8217;s plan, whether pleasant or unpleasant. Here Jesus asks to be 
absolved of the need to be crucified to save humankind, but he decides to be 
obedient to the Father&#8217;s will. Perhaps the &#8220;angel&#8221; (22:43) 
strengthens Jesus by reminding him of God&#8217;s purpose. (22:43-44 are not in 
the earliest manuscripts, so may have been added.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleeping because of grief&#8221; (22:45) looks odd, but extreme grief 
can lead to emotional exhaustion. Even so, this is a time for prayer, not 
sleep. Jesus rises (&#8220;got up&#8221;) as he will at the resurrection: only 
through its power will followers avoid falling into temptation.</p>
<p>Judas&#8217; action is especially treacherous because he is in a privileged 
position: he is &#8220;one of the twelve&#8221; (22:47). A kiss was normally a 
sign of intimacy; it was given to a respected teacher. Even on this occasion, 
Jesus remains non-violent. Perhaps mention of a &#8220;sword&#8221; (22:49) 
harks back to 22:38: perhaps &#8220;one of them&#8221; (22:50) still 
misunderstands. Jesus performs a miracle: in touching the slave&#8217;s ear, he 
heals an enemy! Those who have to come to arrest Jesus are the Jewish religious 
and political leaders (22:52). Jesus points out to them that he is not a 
&#8220;bandit&#8221;: he is not a threat to law and order, to Roman rule.</p>
<p>Now they bring him to the &#8220;high priest&#8217;s [Caiaphas&#8217;] 
house&#8221; (22:54), which is round a &#8220;courtyard&#8221; (22:55). To 
guard against the cold of the night, a &#8220;fire&#8221; burns in a charcoal 
brazier. What Jesus foretold in 22:31-34 now happens: Peter, trying to shrink 
into the crowd, is noticed; he denies knowing Jesus (22:57). Perhaps those who 
identify him in 22:58-59 are men: per Deuteronomy 19:15, two male witnesses 
were required in law. Peter&#8217;s accent shows him to be Galilean (22:59). 
Peter does recall Jesus&#8217; words (22:61), and he repents (&#8220;wept 
bitterly&#8221;, 22:62) &#8211; unlike Judas; he will be saved.</p>
<p>Luke&#8217;s placement of the trial before the Sanhedrin (the supreme court) 
in the morning (rather than beginning at night and continuing in the early 
morning, as Mark has it) is legally correct. &#8220;Elders ... , both chief 
priests, and scribes&#8221; (22:66) constituted the &#8220;council&#8221;, 
which regulated religious (and minor political) matters.</p>
<p>Jesus does not answer them when they ask whether he is the Messiah, because 
they would misunderstand his answer. Apparently powerless, he foretells that 
God will prove right both him and his ministry: he &#8220;will be seated at the 
right hand of the power of God&#8221; (22:69). He does not deny that he is the 
&#8220;Son of God&#8221; (22:70). The Sanhedrin considers that they have 
sufficient evidence to bring him before the Roman authorities.</p>
<p>Jesus is now brought before &#8220;Pilate&#8221; (23:1) on charges that he 
has violated Roman law: the charges are made to sound like treason, but neither 
did he forbid payment of taxes (see 20:20-25) nor is his kingship political 
(23:2). Pilate, Prefect of Judea 26-36 AD, has the authority to impose a 
sentence of death by crucifixion. Refusing to take religious ideas in a 
political way, Pilate announces Jesus&#8217; acquittal (23:4), but then he 
yields to popular opinion in sending him to Herod Antipas, tetrarch of a 
territory which includes Galilee, Jesus&#8217; home district (23:6-7).</p>
<p>Herod is curious to &#8220;see&#8221; (23:8) Jesus: he hopes for a miracle 
&#8211; but his kind of <em>seeing</em> is not that required for faith. Jesus 
remains silent: he is the innocently suffering righteous one. Again he is 
mocked (23:11). Herod <em>passes the buck</em> back to Pilate. Even when 
seemingly powerless, Jesus is able to bring about reconciliation: between Herod 
and Pilate (23:12).</p>
<p>In 23:13-25, Jesus is tried in full compliance with Roman law: he has been 
arrested (23:14a); he is charged (&#8220;perverting ...&#8221;); he is 
examined; Herod&#8217;s verdict supports Pilate&#8217;s findings (23:15a); 
Jesus is acquitted; he receives a judicial warning (23:16). Three times the 
authorities and the people demand Jesus&#8217; death (23:18, 21, 23); however 
in 23:35, 48 the people (but not their leaders) repent.</p>
<p>Ironically, &#8220;Barabbas&#8221; (23:18) means <em>son of the father</em>, 
but they reject the one who is God&#8217;s Son! 23:19 &amp; 25 tell us that 
Barabbas is a nefarious character. Jesus will die for even such as him. Pilate 
gives in to the mob, who have been <em>whipped up</em> by the religious 
authorities (23:25). (Matthew and Mark tell us of the custom of pardoning a 
criminal at Passover; v. 17, which scholars say is probably not original, 
mentions this custom.)</p>
<p>The custom was for a criminal to carry the crossbar, the rest of the cross 
being permanently installed on a hill outside the city. The religious 
authorities and the mob cause &#8220;Simon of Cyrene&#8221; (23:26) to help 
Jesus by carrying the crossbar. (The Greek translated as &#8220;made him 
carry&#8221;, <em>laid on him</em>, elsewhere clearly means <em>laid friendly 
hands on him</em> &#8211; for healing. &#8220;Cyrene&#8221; was in North 
Africa, near Bengazi. From Mark, we learn that he was known to the Church, so 
he may have been a Christian.) The procession includes two other prisoners 
(23:32) and a few soldiers.</p>
<p>There are others in the crowd who are for Jesus, and repent (&#8220;beating 
their breasts ...&#8221;, 23:27), but in 23:28-31, Jesus warns the residents of 
the city to repent of their rejection of him, God&#8217;s prophet, otherwise 
God will punish them. People considered child-bearing a special blessing, and 
barrenness a particular curse, so 23:29 would <em>hit home</em>. 23:31 is a 
proverbial saying, probably meaning here: if the innocent Jesus (who is 
life-giving, &#8220;green&#8221;) meets such a fate as crucifixion, what will 
the fate of the guilty city dwellers (who are dead, &#8220;dry&#8221;) be?</p>
<p>&#8220;The place that is called The Skull&#8221; (23:33) is called Golgotha 
in the other gospels. <em>Golgotha</em> is a Greek transliteration for an 
Aramaic word meaning <em>skull</em>. Crucifixion was a very cruel form of 
execution; death from suffocation came slowly, often after several days, and 
resulted from the trauma caused by flogging, thirst, hunger, exhaustion, and 
exposure. The victims&#8217; arms being stretched back, breathing was 
difficult. While he had the strength, he periodically lifted himself with his 
legs to take a breath.</p>
<p>Jesus continues his ministry of giving forgiveness to those who have not 
heard the Good News (23:34). The division of his clothing fulfills Psalm 22:18; 
to be deprived of one&#8217;s clothing was to lose one&#8217;s identity. 
(Biblical examples are prisoners, slaves, prostitutes and damned people.) The 
mob contemplates what is happening, but the &#8220;leaders&#8221; (23:35) taunt 
Jesus: they blaspheme against God.</p>
<p>In accord with Psalm 69:21, a psalm of the innocently suffering godly one, 
Jesus is offered &#8220;sour wine&#8221; (23:36) &#8211; to revive him, and to 
prolong his ordeal. Ironically, &#8220;Messiah of God&#8221; (23:35), 
&#8220;his chosen one&#8221; and &#8220;King of the Jews&#8221; (23:37) are all 
true. Jesus refuses to subvert God&#8217;s plan by saving himself from a 
horrible death. A placard was placed around the criminal&#8217;s neck, bearing 
an &#8220;inscription&#8221; (23:38), stating his crime.</p>
<p>One criminal joins with the mob (23:39) but the other responds positively to 
Jesus (23:43). Despite his criminal past, for the latter there is salvation; 
Jesus pronounces him free of sin. Only a king can give pardon. 
(&#8220;Paradise&#8221; was the Jewish name for the temporary resting place of 
the godly dead.) The earth (God&#8217;s creation) and the Temple also respond 
positively to Jesus death: the &#8220;darkness&#8221; (23:44) may have been a 
solar eclipse; the torn &#8220;curtain&#8221; (23:45) symbolizes the end of the 
separation between the priests and the people: open access of humankind to God 
has arrived. (The curtain was that before the Holy of Holies, through which 
only the high priest passed.)</p>
<p>Jesus&#8217; words in 23:46 are based on Psalm 31:5, another psalm of the 
innocently suffering righteous one; he shows his profound trust in the Father. 
Jesus concludes his life of obedience to God&#8217;s will. With God&#8217;s 
free gift of faith, a Gentile (&#8220;centurion&#8221;, 23:47) sees, 
understands, the deep significance of Jesus&#8217; forgiveness of the criminal: 
Jesus&#8217; death has meaning way beyond Israel. The mob repents 
(&#8220;beating their breasts&#8221;, 23:48). Jesus&#8217; 
&#8220;acquaintances&#8221; (23:49) &#8211; apostles and other followers, both 
men and women &#8211; see (or at least, seek) the meaning of what has happened: 
they are &#8220;watching these things&#8221;.</p>
<p>23:50-56 tell us about Jesus&#8217; kingly burial, a great contrast to the 
way he has been treated at the end of his life. The decision of the 
&#8220;council&#8221; (23:50 and 22:70-23:1) may not have been unanimous, for 
&#8220;Joseph&#8221; (23:50) of &#8220;Arimathea&#8221; (23:51) now asks the 
Roman authorities for Jesus&#8217; body (23:52). Joseph &#8220;was waiting 
expectantly for the kingdom of God&#8221; (23:51), so he is either a 
God-fearing Jew or a Christian.</p>
<p>Tombs were cut into the face of an outcrop of soft rock, a geological 
feature rare in the area, so they were reused (after a year or so), the bones 
being moved to an <em>ossuary</em> or bone-box. This tomb is special, fit for 
royalty, for it has never been used (&#8220;where no one had ever been 
laid&#8221;, 23:53). Joseph takes Jesus&#8217; body down from the cross and 
wraps it in a &#8220;linen cloth&#8221;. Linen was a symbol of immortality, so 
he shows hope of the resurrection.</p>
<p>Jesus is given a burial fit for one who is God&#8217;s Messiah (Greek: 
<em>Christos</em>), the Chosen One. Deuteronomy 21:22 stipulates that the 
corpse of one convicted of a capital crime must be buried on the day of his 
death, so it is important that Jesus be buried before sundown. Sundown is also 
the start of the Sabbath (when almost all activity ceased). It is already 
afternoon; time is short. As Luke often tells us, women have an important role: 
they see inside the tomb, and &#8220;how his body was laid.&#8221; (23:55) and 
prepare &#8220;spices and ointments&#8221; (23:56) for anointing Jesus&#8217; 
body later, there being no time now for doing it properly.</p>
