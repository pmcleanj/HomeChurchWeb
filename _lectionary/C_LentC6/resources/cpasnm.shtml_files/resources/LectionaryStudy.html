<P ALIGN=LEFT><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>This
book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1
to 39 were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700
BC. These were difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a
disastrous war was fought with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel,
the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the
cause of these events as social injustice, which he condemned, and
against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written
during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled with a message
of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some
scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the
book, written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters
speak of hope and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for
worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks
of the hope that God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory
and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P>The part of Isaiah written in exile (Chapters 40-55) contains four
<EM>servant songs</EM>, sections that interrupt the <EM>flow</EM> of
the book but have a unity within themselves. The first (42:1-7)
begins &ldquo;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen ...&rdquo;;
in the second (49:1-7) the servant, abused and humiliated, is
commissioned anew; in the third (our passage) he is disciplined and
strengthened by suffering; and in the fourth (52:17-53:12) even the
Gentiles are in awesome contemplation before the suffering and
rejected servant. In late Judaism, he was seen as the perfect
Israelite, one of supreme holiness, a messiah. In the gospels, Jesus
identifies himself as the servant (or slave), the one who frees all
people.</P>
<P>In vv. 4-6, God has &ldquo;opened my ear&rdquo;; he has
commissioned the servant as one who is taught, i.e. like a disciple.
God has made him a &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; (a prophet) of the &ldquo;word&rdquo;
of God, to bring God&rsquo;s comfort to &ldquo;the weary&rdquo;, his
fellow Israelites &ndash; who reject God. He has accepted this
command: he is not &ldquo;rebellious&rdquo;. They have tortured him
(v. 6), as they did prophets before him, but he has accepted their
&ldquo;insult and spitting&rdquo;.</P>
<P>In vv. 7-9a, in courtroom language, the servant says that, because
God helps him, he is not disgraced; he confidently accepts the
suffering (&ldquo;set my face like flint&rdquo;), and will not be put
to shame. God will prove him right (&ldquo;vindicates&rdquo;, v. 8).
He is willing to face his &ldquo;adversaries&rdquo;, his accusers &ndash;
for the godly to &ldquo;stand up together&rdquo; with him against the
ungodly. He is confident that, with God&rsquo;s help, none will
declare him guilty.</P>

PASSION OF THE CHRIST </B></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Like
the proverbial 600 pound gorilla, Mel Gibson&rsquo;s movie, <I>The
Passion of The Christ</I>, is unavoidable as we enter Holy Week 2004.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie or not, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter if you liked the movie or not, a majority of
Christians here in the United States will enter this week with those
images in mind (and even if they haven&rsquo;t seen the movie itself,
the clips on TV and the pictures in newspapers and magazines will
still be front and center in the minds of most Christians). If we are
crafting a sermon, leading or participating in a Bible Study or even
using WORDLINK for personal reflection we have to remember and
consider this fact.<BR><BR>I have to be honest with you, after seeing
the movie, being involved in three formal discussion of the film on
PLU&rsquo;s campus, and having an infinite number of casual
conversations about the movie, frankly I am &ldquo;passion&rsquo;d
out&rdquo;. But then I open the Tacoma News Tribune and see a half
page ad by a number of non-denominational churches in the area that
uses the advertising graphic from the film itself with a tag line
that goes something like, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen the movie, now
come hear the rest of the story&rdquo;. You can&rsquo;t avoid
it.<BR><BR>Having stated that point (or overstating it as the case
may be), the question seems to be, what are we going to do with it?
You can certainly use the events of this Holy Week as a teaching
moment (here&rsquo;s the real Biblical story as the movie utilizes
the non-Biblical resources of the pious practice of the 14 Stations
of the Cross and the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th
century Augustinian nun). However, I caution you that people are
passionate about The Passion and don&rsquo;t like to hear that. They
feel you&rsquo;re trashing the movie they found to be moving and
meaningful. I would suggest keeping this teaching moment for the
education hour or some other teaching forum.<BR><BR>If we want to use
the images of the film while staying true and honest to this week&rsquo;s
lectionary texts and to the Passion account according to Luke, I
would suggest that on this Passion Sunday we focus on the innocent
suffering of Jesus in solidarity with innocent human suffering (my
argument as to why will unfold below) and on our call from Jesus to
stand with the innocent suffering people of our day. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
Old Testament reading is the third &ldquo;Servant Song&rdquo; of
Isaiah (for those of you encountering this term for the first time,
there are a series of four Servant Songs in Isaiah, 42:1-4; 49:1-6;
50:4-11; 52:13-53:12. Old Testament scholars are not sure whom the
Servant Songs refer too, but Christians have long seen Jesus in the
Servant Songs. Read them and you will find many familiar images that
we associate with Jesus). <BR><BR>In this third song, the servant is
portrayed as one taught by God in order to comfort the people.
However, the people reject the servant who must then undergo
suffering though innocent. This suffering the servant accepts,
remaining obedient to God. The song ends with a promise that God will
vindicate the servant who has endured this innocent suffering.<BR><BR>Keep
that image in mind. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>
</P>
<P>The psalmist seeks deliverance from personal enemies. He is &ldquo;in
distress&rdquo;: his troubles have led to ill health; his strength
fails him (v. 10); perhaps he is terminally ill. He is &ldquo;scorned
by all ... [his] enemies&rdquo; (v. 11a, Revised English Bible) and
even by his neighbours; his friends avoid him. People forget about
him, as though he is already dead (v. 12); he feels as useless as
&ldquo;something thrown away&rdquo; (New English Bible). People are
conducting a whispering campaign against him and they scheme to take
his life (v. 13); but he accepts God personally; he has confidence in
God (v. 14). His destiny (&ldquo;times&rdquo;, v. 15) is safe in
God&rsquo;s hands; he trusts that God will deliver him from his
adversaries and persecutors. Seeing himself as a &ldquo;servant&rdquo;
(v. 16), he cries <EM>let me experience you, O God!</EM> May God, in
his compassion, save him from all that besets him. In vv. 21-24
(perhaps written later), he gives thanks to God for hearing his call
for help. God&rsquo;s unfailing love for him in his distress was
wonderful. May his experience be an example for others.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Paul wrote to the church at Philippi, a prosperous
Roman colony in northern Greece, from prison. We do not know whether
this imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome. It appears that he was
held under house arrest. It is possible that the epistle is actually
made up of three letters. It contains many personal references,
exhorts members of the Philippian church to live the Christian life
and to good ethical conduct, introduces Timothy and Epaphroditus as
his representatives, and warns against legalists and libertines.
Lastly, he thanks the Philippian community for their material
support. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Philippians 2:5-11</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>In vv. 1-4, Paul has urged the Christians at Philippi, through
&ldquo;encouragement in Christ&rdquo;, and moved by God&rsquo;s love
for them, to &ldquo;be of the same mind[set], having the same love,
being in full accord ...&rdquo;. They are to &ldquo;regard others as
better than ... [themselves]&rdquo;, freely adopting a lowly,
unassertive stance before others, replacing self-interest with
concern for others.</P>
<P>Vv. 5-11 are an early Christian hymn to which Paul has added v.
8b. He exhorts his readers to be of the same mindset as Jesus &ndash;
one that is appropriate for them, given their existence &ldquo;in
Christ&rdquo; (v. 5). Christ was &ldquo;in the form of God&rdquo; (v.
6): he was already like God; he had a God-like way of being, e.g. he
was not subject to death. He shared in God&rsquo;s very nature. Even
so, he did not &ldquo;regard&rdquo; being like God &ldquo;as
something to be exploited&rdquo;, i.e. to be grasped and held on to
for his own purposes. Rather, he &ldquo;emptied himself&rdquo; (v.
7), made himself powerless and ineffective - as a slave is powerless,
without rights. He took on the likeness of a human being, with all
which that entails (except sin), including &ldquo;death&rdquo; (v.
8). As a man, he lowered (&ldquo;humbled&rdquo;) himself, and
throughout his life in the world, was fully human and totally
obedient to God, even to dying. (Paul now adds: even to the most
debasing way of dying, crucifixion &ndash; reserved for slaves and
the worst criminals.)</P>
<P>God actively responded to this total denial of self, his complete
<EM>living and dying for others</EM>, by placing him above all other
godly people (&ldquo;highly exalted him&rdquo;, v. 9), and bestowing
on him the name, title and authority of &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; (v. 11)
over the whole universe (&ldquo;heaven&rdquo;, v. 10, &ldquo;earth&rdquo;,
&ldquo;under the earth&rdquo;). God has given him authority which, in
the Old Testament, he reserved for himself. (Isaiah 45:22-25, in the
Revised English Bible, says: &ldquo;From every corner of the earth
turn to me and be saved; for I am God ... to me every knee shall bow
... to me every tongue shall swear, saying &lsquo;In the Lord alone
are victory and might ... all Israel&rsquo;s descendants will be
victorious and will glory in the L<FONT SIZE=2>ORD</FONT>&rsquo;&rdquo;);
everyone shall worship him; confessing that &ldquo;Jesus Christ is
Lord&rdquo; (v. 11) is equivalent to proclaiming the victory and
might of God. The ultimate goal is the &ldquo;glory of God the
Father&rdquo;, the reclamation of God&rsquo;s sovereignty, his power
over, and presence in, the universe.<A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comments/copy.shtml">&copy;</A>

<H4><B>Philippians 2:6-11</B>Empty Himself</H4>
<P>The past 60 years, most biblical scholars have seen this passage
as a hymn sung in early Christian communities. Paul adopted (even
adapted) the song for his letter to the Philippians. The original
form is hotly debated; some group the verses into two stanzas (6-8 &amp;
9-11); others group the verses into three stanzas (6-7a, 7b-8, &amp;
9-11). Whether Paul made additions or subtractions to the hymn is
unknown. The author, influences, and background are speculative. But,
the verses do reflect the early Christian belief that identified the
Christ as Isaiah's Suffering Servant.</P>
<P>Notice hymn began with the divine (2:6) and returned to the divine
(2:9-11). But, the focus was on Jesus. He existed in God and did not
&quot;seize&quot; Godhood. Instead, Jesus descended to the level of
humanity. 2:7b-8 used two phrases built around the verb &quot;becoming.&quot;
In 2:7c, &quot;becoming in the likeness of men&quot; referred back to
Jesus emptying himself into the form of a servant (2:7b). In 2:8b,
&quot;becoming obedient until death&quot; referred back to the
humiliation of Jesus (2:8a). The core of the hymn used &quot;emptying&quot;
for the Incarnation and &quot;humbling&quot; for the Passion, the two
pillars of our faith in Christ. God responded with the resurrection
(2:9a) and glorification (2:9b) of Christ. The response of the
follower is worship (2:10) and profession of faith (2:11).</P>
<P>So, why did the Christians sing this hymn? They worshiped and
professed faith in Christ because of the self-giving nature of their
Savior and because of God's activity. The divine Son of God was
humble in his birth and death. God was faithful to his Son and his
followers. He gave both eternal life.</P>
<P><I>How does Christ serve you? How does his service inspire you to
worship God? How do you honor the name of Jesus? </I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mel
Gibson&rsquo;s <I>The Passion of The Christ </I>and other passion
plays and devotionals use elements of all the gospels (a quick
example: on Good Friday many of us consider the &ldquo;seven last
words&rdquo; of Jesus from the cross. No one gospel has them all. The
seven are a combination of all four gospels). However, as Lutheran
Christians who are committed to Biblical learning, we should know
that each gospel has certain themes which come to the surface and are
different than the other gospels even when considering the same event
in the life of Jesus. That is true of the Passion story.<BR><BR>In
Luke&rsquo;s Passion account, there are a number of unique items
which we will not go into in this WORDLINK. I list a few only to whet
your appetite to discover them yourself. Note that in Luke there is
mentioned two cups at the last supper (22:17 and 22:20) probably part
of the Passover meal ritual, but who knows? Luke is the only gospel
to record Jesus before Herod (23:6-16). Luke has Jesus lament over
Jerusalem for a second time (23:27-31). Only Luke records the
conversation with the other criminals on the cross (23:39-43). <BR><BR>You
get the picture. What I would like to point out in this week&rsquo;s
WORDLINK is how much Luke goes out of his way to show that Jesus is
innocent of any crime and suffers as an innocent person. In the
garden of Gethsemane, Jesus points out his own innocence as he is
arrested (22:52-53). Pilate declares Jesus innocent three times
(23:4, 14 and 22). Herod finds no fault with Jesus (23:15). The other
criminal while hanging on the cross with Jesus announces Jesus&rsquo;
innocence (23:41). <BR><BR>The final, most obvious reference comes
when Jesus dies. Think about the centurion at the foot of the cross,
what does he declare? Most of us recall the centurion (remember it
was John Wayne in <I>The Greatest Story Ever Told</I>) saying boldly,
&ldquo;Certainly this man was the Son of God.&rdquo; Now look at what
the centurion has to say of Jesus in Luke 23:47. &ldquo;Certainly
this man was innocent.&rdquo; Yep, innocent.<BR><BR>Jesus is the
suffering servant who is sent by God to comfort the people with the
gospel but who is rejected by the very people he is sent too and then
suffers innocently at their hands. All just like Isaiah&rsquo;s
Servant Song declares.<BR><BR>This is where <I>The Passion of The
Christ</I> comes in. While there are a lot of messages being conveyed
(the most obvious one being that Jesus is enduring all of this
suffering because of our sin, Mel makes that clear in the garden of
Gethsemane scene) one of those images is of Jesus suffering all of
this as an innocent person.<BR><BR>While the Passion of Jesus conveys
many things certainly one of them is that Jesus, God, suffers with
those who must suffer injustice and oppression. In a recent Faith and
Reason Dialog here on the campus of PLU, Dr. Tamara Williams made a
couple of comments that I found helpful. When commenting on how the
graphic images of Jesus in Gibson&rsquo;s movie would not be that
shocking to those in South America, Professor Williams noted that
those graphic images of Christ&rsquo;s suffering have always been a
part of the culture. So much so that some communities even go to the
point of reenacting the crucifixion of Jesus by actually crucifying
one of their own people. When asked why the suffering plays so much a
part of their culture, Dr. Williams noted that these people find a
Jesus who is willing to suffer with them in their oppression, their
poverty and in the injustices they face.<BR><BR>This may be a bit
harder for those of us in North America to understand. We don&rsquo;t
always believe that people suffer innocently. We always convince
ourselves that people deserve what they get whether they are
convicted unjustly for a crime they didn&rsquo;t do (oh, they must
have been in the area of the crime and look at their police record!)
or whether they suffer in poverty (oh, they could get a job if they
wanted too). Innocent suffering isn&rsquo;t a part of our language
and landscape except when it comes to health. Sometimes we understand
innocent suffering when people have cancer (but even there we look
for a reason; did he smoke? Did she drink too much?)<BR><BR>But
innocent suffering was a reality for Luke and for the Christians in
Luke&rsquo;s community who would soon face oppression for their faith
in Jesus. We must find a way to convey that to our comfortable
congregations. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

of the knocks on Mel Gibson&rsquo;s movie is that the suffering of
Jesus is outside of the context of his teaching, preaching and

do anything.<BR><BR>I would argue that Luke and Jesus would have us,
the followers of Jesus, be willing to suffer on behalf of and with
other innocent sufferers of our day. The Christ Hymn of Paul&rsquo;s
that is our second lesson reminds us of this in a powerful way. It
begins, &ldquo;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus&hellip;&rdquo;
Paul then goes on to proclaim Jesus&rsquo; incarnation as a servant,
a servant of all of us. Jesus is the one who has the power of God at
his fingertips but who chooses to suffer and die with and for
us.<BR><BR>That servanthood, that innocent suffering, should motivate
us to follow the commands of Jesus to love neighbor and enemy, those
like us and those not like us, to enter into the suffering of others
and to speak out when we see injustice, oppression and
dehumanization.<BR><BR>As we enter Holy Week we do so not as a people
who are comfortably seated to watch a movie, but as a people who are

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2>Luke is the third synoptic (or
quasi-chronological) gospel in the New Testament. Its author,
traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied Paul on some of his
missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew), a
collection of sayings (known as Q for <EM>Quelle</EM>) and his own
source. It is a gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the
disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts, sinners and lepers. Women play a
more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke never uses
Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote
primarily for Gentiles. </FONT>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 22:14-23:56</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus and his &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; are gathered in a room on the
second floor of a house in Jerusalem. It would be a guest room,
furnished with rugs, cushions and perhaps a low table. 22:13 says
&ldquo;... they went and found everything as he had told them ...&rdquo;,
so they are confident that what he now promises will really happen.
The &ldquo;hour&rdquo; (22:14) is both the time of the meal &ndash;
after sundown &ndash; and the time of completion of his <EM>rescue
mission</EM>. Jesus begins his farewell speech to his followers with
the Last Supper. (The name comes from 1 Corinthians 11:20, &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s supper&rdquo;.) He thinks of this meal as pointing
forward to the banquet in the kingdom of God (22:17-18). The
traditional prayer of thanks over the cup is <EM>Blessed are you,
Lord our God, king of the world, who has created the fruit of the
vine.</EM> Throughout the speech, Jesus continues to teach, to
prepare his followers for their mission in the world. Some Jewish
meals began with sharing a common cup of wine, and drinking another
after the meal (22:20). Jesus again gives &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;
(22:19): the Greek word, <EM>eucharistesas</EM>, gives us the word
<EM>Eucharist</EM>. The &ldquo;loaf of bread&rdquo; was likely a flat
cake of leavened bread. Jews to this day bless the bread and break
it, but Jesus says something special: &ldquo;This is my body&rdquo;
God gives to free us from sin.</P>
<P>That his body is to be broken may indicate that he expects to be
stoned, (crucifixion did not necessarily involve breaking bones.) He
commands the disciples to &ldquo;do this&rdquo;. Again, &ldquo;poured&rdquo;
(22:20) points to death by stoning: such deaths were bloody while
crucifixion was not. He inaugurates a &ldquo;new covenant&rdquo;, a
new bond between God and humankind. (In Exodus 24:3-8, Moses binds
the people to the old covenant by dashing blood on them.) Jesus gives
his followers the Eucharist as a continuing remembrance of his
sacrifice for humankind. In 22:21-22, Jesus foretells that one of the
twelve will betray him. This is part of God&rsquo;s plan; even though
God has &ldquo;determined&rdquo; it, Judas&rsquo; fate will be
horrible!</P>
<P>In 22:24-27, Jesus talks about what it is to be a leader in the
Church. Hellenistic kings were called &ldquo;benefactors&rdquo;
(22:25) while in fact they <EM>lorded it</EM> over the people, but
leadership in the Christian community is different: leaders are to
adopt Jesus&rsquo; style of leadership, to recognize that their
talents as leaders are gifts from God, and that they are to serve all
in need. Jesus bequeaths (&ldquo;confer&rdquo;, 22:29) to those who
have shared in his &ldquo;trials&rdquo; (22:28) membership in the
Kingdom of God. They will join with him in showing to the <EM>new
Israel</EM>, the Church (&ldquo;the twelve tribes of Israel&rdquo;,
22:30) that God is right, and share in proclaiming the fulfilment of
God&rsquo;s promises to humankind.</P>
<P>In 22:31, Jesus calls Peter &ldquo;Simon&rdquo;, the name he had
before becoming a disciple. This verse may look odd, but God placed
Job in the hands of the devil, to determine his worth: see Job 1:12;
2:6. Jesus has prayed for Peter&rsquo;s constancy but he predicts, in
spite of Peter&rsquo;s statement (22:33), that Peter will deny
knowing Jesus. After his denial, when he returns to Christ, leader
that he is, Peter is to use his experience to deepen the faith of the
others (22:32)</P>
<P>In 10:4, Jesus has sent out the seventy to do his mission &ldquo;without
a purse, bag or sandals&rdquo; (22:35), but times have changed: his
followers must now be prepared for suffering, and even for death
(&ldquo;sword&rdquo;, 22:36), in carrying out his commission. In
22:37, Jesus foretells that he will fulfil Isaiah 53:12 (part of a
<EM>Servant Song</EM>): he will be considered a criminal &ndash; and
so will his followers, but they take him literally (&ldquo;two
swords&rdquo;, 22:38).</P>
<P>Jesus now leaves the house and walks to the garden on the &ldquo;Mount
of Olives&rdquo; (22:39), across the Kidron Valley from Jerusalem.
(21:37 tells us of previous visits.) The twelve, and probably other
followers, go with him. There he prays for those with him, that they
may not be faced with the struggle between God and the devil (22:40)
expected to precede the coming of the Kingdom. Usually people stood
to pray, but Jesus kneels in humility (22:41).</P>
<P>In the Old Testament, a &ldquo;cup&rdquo; (22:42) refers to an
action in God&rsquo;s plan, whether pleasant or unpleasant. Here
Jesus asks to be absolved of the need to be crucified to save
humankind, but he decides to be obedient to the Father&rsquo;s will.
Perhaps the &ldquo;angel&rdquo; (22:43) strengthens Jesus by
reminding him of God&rsquo;s purpose. (22:43-44 are not in the
earliest manuscripts, so may have been added.)</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sleeping because of grief&rdquo; (22:45) looks odd, but
extreme grief can lead to emotional exhaustion. Even so, this is a
time for prayer, not sleep. Jesus rises (&ldquo;got up&rdquo;) as he
will at the resurrection: only through its power will followers avoid
falling into temptation.</P>
<P>Judas&rsquo; action is especially treacherous because he is in a
privileged position: he is &ldquo;one of the twelve&rdquo; (22:47). A
kiss was normally a sign of intimacy; it was given to a respected
teacher. Even on this occasion, Jesus remains non-violent. Perhaps
mention of a &ldquo;sword&rdquo; (22:49) harks back to 22:38: perhaps
&ldquo;one of them&rdquo; (22:50) still misunderstands. Jesus
performs a miracle: in touching the slave&rsquo;s ear, he heals an
enemy! Those who have to come to arrest Jesus are the Jewish
religious and political leaders (22:52). Jesus points out to them
that he is not a &ldquo;bandit&rdquo;: he is not a threat to law and
order, to Roman rule.</P>
<P>Now they bring him to the &ldquo;high priest&rsquo;s [Caiaphas&rsquo;]
house&rdquo; (22:54), which is round a &ldquo;courtyard&rdquo;
(22:55). To guard against the cold of the night, a &ldquo;fire&rdquo;
burns in a charcoal brazier. What Jesus foretold in 22:31-34 now
happens: Peter, trying to shrink into the crowd, is noticed; he
denies knowing Jesus (22:57). Perhaps those who identify him in
22:58-59 are men: per Deuteronomy 19:15, two male witnesses were
required in law. Peter&rsquo;s accent shows him to be Galilean
(22:59). Peter does recall Jesus&rsquo; words (22:61), and he repents
(&ldquo;wept bitterly&rdquo;, 22:62) &ndash; unlike Judas; he will be
saved.</P>
<P>Luke&rsquo;s placement of the trial before the Sanhedrin (the
supreme court) in the morning (rather than beginning at night and
continuing in the early morning, as Mark has it) is legally correct.
&ldquo;Elders ... , both chief priests, and scribes&rdquo; (22:66)
constituted the &ldquo;council&rdquo;, which regulated religious (and
minor political) matters.</P>
<P>Jesus does not answer them when they ask whether he is the
Messiah, because they would misunderstand his answer. Apparently
powerless, he foretells that God will prove right both him and his
ministry: he &ldquo;will be seated at the right hand of the power of
God&rdquo; (22:69). He does not deny that he is the &ldquo;Son of
God&rdquo; (22:70). The Sanhedrin considers that they have sufficient
evidence to bring him before the Roman authorities.</P>
<P>Jesus is now brought before &ldquo;Pilate&rdquo; (23:1) on charges
that he has violated Roman law: the charges are made to sound like
treason, but neither did he forbid payment of taxes (see 20:20-25)
nor is his kingship political (23:2). Pilate, Prefect of Judea 26-36
AD, has the authority to impose a sentence of death by crucifixion.
Refusing to take religious ideas in a political way, Pilate announces
Jesus&rsquo; acquittal (23:4), but then he yields to popular opinion
in sending him to Herod Antipas, tetrarch of a territory which
includes Galilee, Jesus&rsquo; home district (23:6-7).</P>
<P>Herod is curious to &ldquo;see&rdquo; (23:8) Jesus: he hopes for a
miracle &ndash; but his kind of <EM>seeing</EM> is not that required
for faith. Jesus remains silent: he is the innocently suffering
righteous one. Again he is mocked (23:11). Herod <EM>passes the buck</EM>
back to Pilate. Even when seemingly powerless, Jesus is able to bring
about reconciliation: between Herod and Pilate (23:12).</P>
<P>In 23:13-25, Jesus is tried in full compliance with Roman law: he
has been arrested (23:14a); he is charged (&ldquo;perverting ...&rdquo;);
he is examined; Herod&rsquo;s verdict supports Pilate&rsquo;s
findings (23:15a); Jesus is acquitted; he receives a judicial warning
(23:16). Three times the authorities and the people demand Jesus&rsquo;
death (23:18, 21, 23); however in 23:35, 48 the people (but not their
leaders) repent.</P>
<P>Ironically, &ldquo;Barabbas&rdquo; (23:18) means <EM>son of the
father</EM>, but they reject the one who is God&rsquo;s Son! 23:19 &amp;
25 tell us that Barabbas is a nefarious character. Jesus will die for
even such as him. Pilate gives in to the mob, who have been <EM>whipped
up</EM> by the religious authorities (23:25). (Matthew and Mark tell
us of the custom of pardoning a criminal at Passover; v. 17, which
scholars say is probably not original, mentions this custom.)</P>
<P>The custom was for a criminal to carry the crossbar, the rest of
the cross being permanently installed on a hill outside the city. The
religious authorities and the mob cause &ldquo;Simon of Cyrene&rdquo;
(23:26) to help Jesus by carrying the crossbar. (The Greek translated
as &ldquo;made him carry&rdquo;, <EM>laid on him</EM>, elsewhere
clearly means <EM>laid friendly hands on him</EM> &ndash; for
healing. &ldquo;Cyrene&rdquo; was in North Africa, near Bengazi. From
Mark, we learn that he was known to the Church, so he may have been a
Christian.) The procession includes two other prisoners (23:32) and a
few soldiers.</P>
<P>There are others in the crowd who are for Jesus, and repent
(&ldquo;beating their breasts ...&rdquo;, 23:27), but in 23:28-31,
Jesus warns the residents of the city to repent of their rejection of
him, God&rsquo;s prophet, otherwise God will punish them. People
considered child-bearing a special blessing, and barrenness a
particular curse, so 23:29 would <EM>hit home</EM>. 23:31 is a
proverbial saying, probably meaning here: if the innocent Jesus (who
is life-giving, &ldquo;green&rdquo;) meets such a fate as
crucifixion, what will the fate of the guilty city dwellers (who are
dead, &ldquo;dry&rdquo;) be?</P>
<P>&ldquo;The place that is called The Skull&rdquo; (23:33) is called
Golgotha in the other gospels. <EM>Golgotha</EM> is a Greek
transliteration for an Aramaic word meaning <EM>skull</EM>.
Crucifixion was a very cruel form of execution; death from
suffocation came slowly, often after several days, and resulted from
the trauma caused by flogging, thirst, hunger, exhaustion, and
exposure. The victims&rsquo; arms being stretched back, breathing was
difficult. While he had the strength, he periodically lifted himself
with his legs to take a breath.</P>
<P>Jesus continues his ministry of giving forgiveness to those who
have not heard the Good News (23:34). The division of his clothing
fulfills Psalm 22:18; to be deprived of one&rsquo;s clothing was to
lose one&rsquo;s identity. (Biblical examples are prisoners, slaves,
prostitutes and damned people.) The mob contemplates what is
happening, but the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; (23:35) taunt Jesus: they
blaspheme against God.</P>
<P>In accord with Psalm 69:21, a psalm of the innocently suffering
godly one, Jesus is offered &ldquo;sour wine&rdquo; (23:36) &ndash;
to revive him, and to prolong his ordeal. Ironically, &ldquo;Messiah
of God&rdquo; (23:35), &ldquo;his chosen one&rdquo; and &ldquo;King
of the Jews&rdquo; (23:37) are all true. Jesus refuses to subvert
God&rsquo;s plan by saving himself from a horrible death. A placard
was placed around the criminal&rsquo;s neck, bearing an &ldquo;inscription&rdquo;
(23:38), stating his crime.</P>
<P>One criminal joins with the mob (23:39) but the other responds
positively to Jesus (23:43). Despite his criminal past, for the
latter there is salvation; Jesus pronounces him free of sin. Only a
king can give pardon. (&ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; was the Jewish name for
the temporary resting place of the godly dead.) The earth (God&rsquo;s
creation) and the Temple also respond positively to Jesus death: the
&ldquo;darkness&rdquo; (23:44) may have been a solar eclipse; the
torn &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; (23:45) symbolizes the end of the
separation between the priests and the people: open access of
humankind to God has arrived. (The curtain was that before the Holy
of Holies, through which only the high priest passed.)</P>
<P>Jesus&rsquo; words in 23:46 are based on Psalm 31:5, another psalm
of the innocently suffering righteous one; he shows his profound
trust in the Father. Jesus concludes his life of obedience to God&rsquo;s
will. With God&rsquo;s free gift of faith, a Gentile (&ldquo;centurion&rdquo;,
23:47) sees, understands, the deep significance of Jesus&rsquo;
forgiveness of the criminal: Jesus&rsquo; death has meaning way
beyond Israel. The mob repents (&ldquo;beating their breasts&rdquo;,
23:48). Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;acquaintances&rdquo; (23:49) &ndash;
apostles and other followers, both men and women &ndash; see (or at
least, seek) the meaning of what has happened: they are &ldquo;watching
these things&rdquo;.</P>
<P>23:50-56 tell us about Jesus&rsquo; kingly burial, a great
contrast to the way he has been treated at the end of his life. The
decision of the &ldquo;council&rdquo; (23:50 and 22:70-23:1) may not
have been unanimous, for &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo; (23:50) of &ldquo;Arimathea&rdquo;
(23:51) now asks the Roman authorities for Jesus&rsquo; body (23:52).
Joseph &ldquo;was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God&rdquo;
(23:51), so he is either a God-fearing Jew or a Christian.</P>
<P>Tombs were cut into the face of an outcrop of soft rock, a
geological feature rare in the area, so they were reused (after a
year or so), the bones being moved to an <EM>ossuary</EM> or
bone-box. This tomb is special, fit for royalty, for it has never
been used (&ldquo;where no one had ever been laid&rdquo;, 23:53).
Joseph takes Jesus&rsquo; body down from the cross and wraps it in a
&ldquo;linen cloth&rdquo;. Linen was a symbol of immortality, so he
shows hope of the resurrection.</P>
<P>Jesus is given a burial fit for one who is God&rsquo;s Messiah
(Greek: <EM>Christos</EM>), the Chosen One. Deuteronomy 21:22
stipulates that the corpse of one convicted of a capital crime must
be buried on the day of his death, so it is important that Jesus be
buried before sundown. Sundown is also the start of the Sabbath (when
almost all activity ceased). It is already afternoon; time is short.
As Luke often tells us, women have an important role: they see inside
the tomb, and &ldquo;how his body was laid.&rdquo; (23:55) and
prepare &ldquo;spices and ointments&rdquo; (23:56) for anointing
Jesus&rsquo; body later, there being no time now for doing it
properly.</P>

<H4>A Question of Innocence</H4>
<P>Passion Part 1:</P>
<P>The Trial of Jesus Before Pilate</P>
<P><I>What makes someone guilty in the court of public opinion?</I></P>
<P>A day does not pass by without a courtroom drama on television.
The judge presides over a battle between two adversaries. The judge
defines rules of the battle. And the judge might even hand down a
determination of guilt or liability.</P>
<P>Even in a courtroom (a television studio or otherwise), the
question of innocence or guilt may be a question of degrees. Or a
certain point of view. In the case of Jesus from Nazareth, innocence
or guilt was a matter of faith.</P>
<P>Luke used a patterns of threes to stress the innocence of Jesus.</P>
<P>23:1 &quot;(the leaders)&quot; is literally &quot;their company.&quot;
In the context, this referred to the leadership of the Sanhedrin.</P>
<P>23:2 When they presented him to Pilate, the leaders brought three
charges against Jesus: a vague charge of public disorder, tax
evasion, and rebellion. All three could carry the death penalty. But,
the trial before the Sanhedrin was religious in nature. According to
Luke, the leadership questioned him on one charge: Was he the Christ?
Notice the leaders turned the charge of blasphemy into political
charges. Also notice all three charges built in upon each other to
paint Jesus as a radical revolutionary, not as a traveling rabbi.</P>
<P>&quot;forbidding (people) to pay tribute to Caesar&quot; Paying
tribute was more than paying Roman taxes with coins bearing the
likeness of the Caesar. Paying taxes with such coins meant an
allegiance to the Emperor. As such, many zealous Jews would have
objected to the payment. For they believed it meant placing Caesar
above God as king.</P>
<P>23:3 &quot;King of the Jews&quot; was a political title that began
with the Hasmonean dynasty after the success of the Maccabean revolt
in early part of the second century B.C.E. Pilate began with the last
charge first, since innocence on this charge would make the first two
charges (public disorder and tax evasion) harder to prove. But, this
was an ironic question. Pilate literally sat in the judgement seat
that Herod the Great, the late King of the Jews, used to rule and
judge the people. So, Pilate implied, &quot;Do you, Jesus, want to
sit in the seat I use to judge you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You say (so)&quot; This is essentially the same answer Jesus
gave to the charge of blasphemy at the Sanhedrin trial (Luke 22:70).
When asked he was the Christ, Jesus turned the question on the
inquisitor. In both cases, Jesus seemed to ask what he asks us &quot;What
do you see in me?&quot;</P>
<P>23:7 &quot;Discovering HE was under the authority of Herod&quot;
Pilate was governor of Judea, but Herod Antipas was tetrarch of
Galilee. According to Luke, Pilate wanted a &quot;second opinion&quot;
in a capital case. So he passed Jesus to Herod. Herod was in
Jerusalem for the Passover celebration. Pilate could add Herod's
judgement to his own against the charges of the Sanhedrin.</P>
<P>23:10-11 While Herod showed disdain toward Jesus, he did not rule
against him.</P>
<P>23:12 Why did Herod and Pilate hate each other before this time?
We can only speculate: jealousy, pride, lust for power, etc. But,
after the trial of Jesus they became friends. Again, we can only
speculate. Possibly, Herod appreciated the professional courtesy of
judging one of his subjects in &quot;foreign&quot; territory.</P>
<P>23:14 &quot;You brought to me this man as (one) turning the people
away (from Roman authority)&quot; Unlike his questioning of Jesus
which began with the last charge, Pilate forgave the first charge:
public disorder. By dismissing the first charge, the other two were
denied.</P>
<P>23:15 &quot;to us&quot; is a collective sense of the first person.
Pilate used fancy language to refer to himself and his court.</P>
<P>Luke was an elegant author. In these few verses, the evangelist
interwove a series of threes: three scenes, three accusations, three
declarations of innocence. The three scenes flow from Pilate to Herod
to Pilate. In each scene, the chief priests and the loyal crowd cry
out for the execution of Jesus. In each scene, the judging authority
declared the innocence of the traveling rabbi. The crescendo built
until Pilate gave into the demands of the mob. Throughout, Luke
stressed the innocence (literally &quot;the righteousness&quot;) of
the Nazarene.</P>
<P>But, sometimes innocence and guilt were a matter of view point. In
a certain sense, the charges against Jesus were true. First, he did
stir up the people in sure expectation of the end times. He turned
the faithful against the religious leaders and toward God. Second, he
did turn people away from Rome, for he placed an allegiance to God
higher than that of Caesar. After all, a main focus of his ministry
was the repentance of tax collectors. When one of these cheats
changed their lives, Rome lost a reliable and efficient means of
collecting money for Caesar. Third, Jesus was the Messiah, the King
of the Jews. And the King of the Greeks. And the King of Rome.</P>
<P>These were moral and religious issues, not political ones. But, in
a culture that mixed religious and political thought into one, the
distinction between faith and public order was a thin one. How could
Jesus and his early followers maintain they were no threat to Rome,
while, at the same time, deny the divine will and activity found in
the Emperor? This was not only the charges against Jesus. The popular
culture made the same charges against those in Luke's audience.
Consider the charges made in Acts 17:6-7:</P>
<P>And when (the synagogue officials) could not find (Paul and
Silas), they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city
authorities, crying, &quot;These men who have turned the world upside
down have come here also, and Jason has received them; and they are
all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is
another king, Jesus.&quot; (RSV)</P>
<P>Christianity was, in effect, a peaceful counter-culture. While it
did not pose an immediate threat to Pax Roma, it did challenge the
attitudes and structures that had built up the Empire. Faith stood
against the self-important arrogance of the Caesar, and, so,
challenged a social order built around cult of the Emperor. Hope
stood against the tyranny of a system that leached life from the
lowliest of subjects; Christianity questioned the decrees of such a
system. Charity stood against the ruthless violence of the Roman
army; the 'Way' followed the love of a different King. Was Jesus and
his followers a threat to the public order in the Empire? The answer
to that depended upon the person asked.</P>
<P><I>Jesus and his followers were controversial. The scandal of the
cross depended upon the vision of the seer. How do you envision the
power of your faith? As the old saying goes, &quot;if you were put on
trial as a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?&quot;</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
