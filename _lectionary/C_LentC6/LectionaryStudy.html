<P>This psalm may have been sung originally as an individual&nbsp;
hymn of thanksgiving, but quickly became a congregational hymn used
to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. One of the six psalms of the
Hallel (Pss. 113-118), pilgrims sang it as they approached the temple
on this and other high holidays. It is yet another of the Psalms
given a messianic interpretation by the Apostolic Church. Several NT
passages alluded to it.</P>
<P>The person who originally sang this hymn (the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of
the text) may have been the king or high priest, but it soon was
reinterpreted as the personification of the nation and sung
antiphonally with several parties singing allotted parts.</P>
<P>The &ldquo;gates of righteousness&rdquo; (vs. 19) referred to the
massive gates at the entrance of the temple precincts representing
the holy presence of Yahweh at the centre of the nation. The words
would have been sung by the priest at the head of the procession of
pilgrims.</P>
<P>Although its use in Christian scriptures invariably refers to
Jesus, &ldquo;the stone which the builders rejected &hellip;&rdquo;
(vs. 22) may have come from an old Hebrew proverb. It may have
referred to a stone that was too large to be used anywhere but as a
cornerstone anchoring a whole wall of a building. Today, most public
buildings like churches have a ceremonial &ldquo;cornerstone&rdquo;
marking the date it dedication and naming the architect who designed
it. The psalmist used it to point out that Israel, though despised by
the Gentile world, had become an honourable and beloved people in
Yahweh&rsquo;s sight.</P>
<P>The day of rejoicing in vs. 24 is the day of the festival, but is
not specifically identified. This may well be the Feast of
Tabernacles, for in vs. 27 the festal procession to decorate &ldquo;the
horns of the altar&rdquo; probably best fits with that festival. The
horns were protrusions at each corner of the altar possibly created
for just such a decorative purpose or on which the blood of the
sacrifice was sprinkled (cf. Lev. 4:7).</P>
<P>Vss. 28 and 29 given what appears to be a double ending to the
psalm. More likely, vs. 28 is the original ending for the individual
hymn of thanksgiving, while vs. 29 is the&nbsp; ending to the
congregation hymn. Alternatively, the first is sung by the celebrant
priest while the second is the antiphony sung by the congregation.</P>

<P><I>According to Luke, following Mark&rsquo;s earlier Gospel, Jesus
had planned his entry into Jerusalem by warning the owner of the colt
that he would need the beast for this occasion. That the colt had
never been ridden emphasized the aura of the incident Jesus&rsquo;
intended to create. The donkey was regarded as a peaceful beast
willingly serving its master, thus creating an image of a servant
rather than a conquering king. Matthew elaborated the story to
include two animals as in a messianic prophecy from Zechariah 9:9-10.
Jesus himself took no part in the celebration. Instead, he rebuked&nbsp;
the Pharisees who complained about the crowd of disciples displaying
their joyous expectations.</I></P>
<P>Those who have visited Jerusalem may have walked the same path
that Jesus took from Bethany and Bethphage on the eastern side of the
Mount of Olives over the ridge and down the western slope toward the
city gates. It is no more than two miles (three kilometres), if that.
Presumably the village Jesus indicated was Bethany where he later
seems to have made his headquarters during&nbsp; his Passion&nbsp;
Week.</P>
<P>According to Luke, following Mark&rsquo;s earlier Gospel, Jesus
had planned his entry into Jerusalem by warning the owner of the colt
that he would need the beast for this occasion. Was it at the home of
Lazarus, Martha and Mary in Bethany, that he had arranged for the
colt? That the colt had never been ridden emphasized the aura of the
incident Jesus&rsquo; intended to create by acting out the Old
Testament prophecy from Zechariah 9:9-10. The donkey was regarded as
a peaceful beast willingly serving its master, thus creating an image
of a servant rather than a conquering king. Matthew elaborated the
story to include two animals as in the prophecy. By choosing the
lowly beast of burden Jesus sought to allay the nationalistic
feelings the prophecy engendered.</P>
<P>The disciples began the celebratory procession by throwing their
cloaks on the colt and setting Jesus upon it. Quickly joining the
celebration, people began strewing their cloaks on the path as he
rode along. Note that Luke makes no mention of branches being strewn
in the way, neither from palm or any other trees as in Mark and
Matthew. Palm branches were used in traditional Jewish celebrations
of the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15.) but not
Passover.&nbsp; The palm was an almost universally sacred symbol
throughout the ancient Near East. In pre-Christian times it was a
symbol of victory and was used in that sense in John 12: 13 and
Revelation 7:12.</P>
<P>As the procession moved down the Mount of Olives, a whole
multitude of disciples began to praise God. Presumably these were
Galileans who had come for the Passover festival and now recognized
Jesus whose miraculous deeds they had been witnessing for some time.
Luke&rsquo;s version of their song differs from the one recorded in
Mark because he chose words from Ps. 118:26. Originally they were
sung by the high priest welcoming pilgrims to the temple. Luke
included the word &ldquo;king&rdquo; to signal that the crowds
believed they were participating in the coronation procession of the
Messiah.</P>
<P>Jesus himself took no part in the celebration. Instead, he
rebuked&nbsp; the Pharisees who complained about the crowd of
disciples displaying their joyous expectations. His words appear to
show that he shared the disciples&rsquo; messianic convictions, at
least in Luke&rsquo;s mind.</P>

</P>
<P><I>The unnamed prophet of Israel&rsquo;s Babylonian exile whose
poetry is included in Isaiah 40-55 describes the response of
persecuted people to their suffering. The longer poem (vss.1-11),
from which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this reading is an excerpt,
portrays the exile as the result of the nation&rsquo;s sin against
God (vs.1). The prophet-poet uses this reflection as a teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
moment. Though written in the 6th century BC, the poem was seen by
the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; early Christian church as a prophecy of Jesus&rsquo;
wholly unjust trial and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execution.</I></P>
<P>We tend to select only excerpts of OT passages with reference to
our Christian liturgical themes and seasons. This passage is yet
another example of that kind of adaptation. We need to understand
both the setting and significance of the original which was never&nbsp;
intended to prophesy the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.</P>
<P>The unnamed prophet of Israel&rsquo;s Babylonian exile whose
poetry is included in Isaiah 40-55 describes the response of
persecuted people to their suffering. Chapter 50:1-11 is a poem of
four strophes (or stanzas: vss. 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-11). It portrays
the exile as the result of the nation&rsquo;s sin against Yahweh&rsquo;s
covenant&nbsp; (vs.1) and contrasts this with Yahweh&rsquo;s
faithfulness and that of the servant of Yahweh who suffers for his
loyalty. Though written in the 6th century BC, the poem was seen by
the early Christian church as a prophecy of Jesus&rsquo; faithfulness
throughout his trial and unjust conviction and death on the cross.</P>
<P>The early church had only the Jewish scriptures from which to
discover the relationship between the life, death and resurrection of
Jesus to which they were witnesses and the purposes of God as
revealed in the historical and religious traditions of Israel. It is
not surprising, therefore, that the apostolic community made some
unusual connections between various passages and their experience of
the crucified and risen Christ. The obedient, faithful and persecuted
servant of this passage gave them exceptional insight into the
sufferings of Christ and their own sufferings under persecution in
subsequent years.</P>
<P>It is hypothesized by redaction critics of the NT that instead of
being actual accounts of what happened, the various versions of the
Passion story were created, each from a different theological
perspective, for very different audiences, and as expositions of
relevant OT passages such as this one. Mel Gibson&rsquo;s
controversial movie, <EM>The Passion of Jesus the Christ</EM>, while
drawing on all four gospels, has given a mediaeval interpretation to
those sufferings more in keeping with Isaiah 52:13-53:12. While the
NT does contain some reference to the great suffering and shame
caused by&nbsp; crucifixion, as in Hebrews 12:3, that is not its main
emphasis. As Otto Piper, formerly of Princeton Seminary, put it,
&ldquo;While in the OT the believer becomes so occupied with his own
suffering that he seems to lose sight of the rest of the world, the
follower of Christ feels as a result of his suffering a deep
compassion for the sufferings of others.&rdquo; (<EM>Interpreter&rsquo;s
Dictionary of the Bible</EM>. IV, 453.)</P>
<P>This prophecy puts greater emphasis on the trust of the persecuted
one in Yahweh in order to encourage fellow sufferers. Physical
violence plays a limited role in the action (vs. 6). Rather, this is
a teaching moment (vs. 4) when the suffering servant is certain of
his innocence and of Yahweh&rsquo;s vindication. He also envisions an
end to the persecution (vss. 8-9). It is this victory over suffering
through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ which becomes a
central theme of the NT.</P>
<P><STRONG><I>PSALM 31:9-16. </I></STRONG><I>Again the Christian
church has interpreted this psalm with reference to the Passion of
Christ. Orignally it was a lament and plea for God&rsquo;s protection
from persecution by false accusers. Though not in this&nbsp; reading,
according to Luke&rsquo;s Gospel vs. 5 of this psalm was uttered by
Jesus on the cross: &ldquo;Into your&nbsp; hand I commit my spirit.&rdquo;
(Luke 23:46)</I></P>
<P><STRONG>PSALM 31:9-16.</STRONG> Again the Christian church has
interpreted this lament and plea for God&rsquo;s protection from
persecution by false accusers with reference to the Passion of
Christ. According to W. Stewart McCullough in <EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s
Bible</EM>,IV, 158ff, the psalm in its entirety consists of three
laments woven together (vss. 1-8; 9-12; 13-18) and concluding with a
hymn of thanksgiving (vss.19-24). This selection includes only the
middle segments. Its two parts consist of the cry of someone who is
suffering from some undefined illness (vss. 9-12) and of someone
menaced by false accusations. The parallel with the Passion story is
obvious, especially in vss.11-13. One could easily imagine Jesus
reciting the prayer in vss. 14-16 as he stood silently before his
accuser and bore the cross along the Via Dolorosa.</P>
<P>Or was it only in the imagination of later generations of
Christians to magnify events along Via Dolorosa so that these became
precious to the faithful in &ldquo;the Stations of the Cross?&rdquo;
All four gospels have very little to say about the journey from
Pilate&rsquo;s seat of judgment to the place where the crucifixion
actually occurred. Only the incidents about Simon of Cyrene being
compelled to carry the cross and the wailing of the women of
Jerusalem appear in the gospel narratives. The actual route of the
journey to the place of crucifixion is lost among the ruins of the
many destructive assaults on Jerusalem over the millennia.
Archeologists and historians believe that following the Via Dolorosa
is a sincere devotional journey with little relationship to the
historical events at that time.</P>
<P>Though not in this reading, vs. 5 of this psalm was uttered by
Jesus on the cross according to Luke&rsquo;s narrative: &ldquo;Into
your hand I commit my spirit.&rdquo; (Luke 23:46) This gives further
evidence of how the early church searched their Hebrew scriptures to
better understand and communicate the Gospel.</P>

</P>
<P><STRONG><I>PHILIPPIANS 2:5-11. </I></STRONG><I>Paul may have found
this hymn in use in one of the congregations he visited, or he may
have created it himself. Note that while it does equate Jesus with
God (vs. 6,) Jesus did not exploit that honour. Rather, it emphasizes
his humanity, his death obedient to God&rsquo;s will, and his
exaltation so that he may be worshiped as Lord of all.<BR></I><STRONG><I><BR></I></STRONG>PHILIPPIANS
2:5-11. This is an early Christian hymn outlining the essential creed
of the early church. In a few well chosen words it recites the whole
sequence of the Incarnation, ministry, crucifixion, resurrection and
exaltation of Jesus as described in the gospel records. But Paul had
not read any of the gospel narratives which were all written after
his own death. He knew only what the first apostles had proclaimed or
had taught him after his conversion. It may be that he found this
hymn in use in one of the congregations he visited, or he may have
created it himself.</P>
<P>In NSRV the passage appears as poetry with some aspects of
parallelism, one of the characteristics of Hebrew poetry. William
Barclay noted that it may well be an elaboration of 2 Corinthians 8:9
&ldquo;For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his
poverty you might become rich.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Note that it does seem to equate Jesus with God (vs. 6). Yet
Barclay examined the original Greek more closely, as did E.F. Scott
in <EM>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible</EM>, XI, 48ff. Barclay came to
the conclusion that this verse does express the &ldquo;innate,&nbsp;
unchangeable, unalterable characteristics and ability of the man&hellip;.
So Paul begins by saying that Jesus was essentially, unalterably, and
unchangeable God.&rdquo;</P>
<P>If it is easily accessible, Barclay&rsquo;s exegesis of this
passage in his Daily Bible Readings Series, <EM>The Letter to the
Philippians, Colossians and Philemon,</EM> is well worth examining in
detail. In particular, his definition of the two Greek words for
&ldquo;form&rdquo; &ndash; morph&sbquo; and schema &ndash; is helpful
in understanding what he believes Paul claimed as the essential
divine nature of the human Jesus: &ldquo;The morph&sbquo; (the word
Paul uses) never changes &hellip;. However Jesus&rsquo; outward
schema might alter, he remained in essence and in being divine.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The humiliation of Jesus as a servant (again the word is morph&sbquo;)
emphasizes his humanity and his death obedient to God&rsquo;s will.
This humiliation leads to his exaltation so that he may be worshiped
as Lord of all. The seven week Season of Easter, from the
Resurrection to Pentecost, celebrates this exaltation.</P>

<P><STRONG>LUKE 22:14-23:56. </STRONG>It is not intended that&nbsp;
the whole story of the Passion should be read during public worship,
though this has been done in a special, extended service accompanied
by musical selections and hymns. Which segment should be used as the
Gospel lesson for worship on Passion Sunday is a matter of
considerable choice. The whole passage could be used for personal
devotions, however, throughout Holy Week. A liturgy of the palms
would have to look to Luke 19:28-40 as an alternative reading.</P>
<P>Note how as the story progresses that many people come and go,
each having contact with Jesus in one way or another, and some role
to play in the drama. The first to leave are those closest to him,
Peter being that last. They were followed by his most hostile
opponents, the chief priests and scribes when they delivered him to
Pilate. Then Pilate himself gave up trying to administer justice and
gave in to political expedience.</P>
<P>Quickly thereafter came Simon the Cyrene who carried the cross,
the weeping women of Jerusalem, the two other criminals, the Roman
centurion, and finally the crowds. In the end, Jesus commits himself
into God&rsquo;s keeping, and dies alone to be buried in an unused
tomb.</P>
<P>In Jerusalem today, two sites are shown to tourists as probable
locations of the place of crucifixion and burial. Without question,
the site where the Church of the Holy Sepulchre stands is the more
elaborate and traditional in Christian lore. Only since the late 19th
century has the site of the Garden Tomb been favourably regarded as
an alternate location.&nbsp; The truth is that the actual place of
Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection are forever lost. The four
Gospels each give a different version of the Passion story based on
their differing theological standpoint and intentions as authors
writing for very disparate communities.</P>
<P>A television documentary broadcast during the week of March 4,
2007 on the Discovery Channel in the USA and Visions in Canada
presented a controversial discovery of ten stone burial ossuaries
containing bones and three skulls had been located some years ago in
a tomb in Jerusalem. The boxes were inscribed with the names of
Jesus, Miriam (Mary), Miriamne (Mary Magdalene), and several others,
presumed to be members of Jesus&rsquo; family. The documentary also
claims that DNA has been found on two of the ossuaries which are not
related &ndash; those of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. This suggests that
Jesus and Mary Magdalene may have been married. Church authorities,
theologians and archeologists all discounted the validity of this
discovery. As with Gibson&rsquo;s portrayal of the crucifixion, it is
clear that the interpreter&rsquo;s own theology determines which site
or what objects are acceptable as a places or relics to inspire
devotion and to be appropriately venerated. It was so also for the
authors of the four Gospel narratives.</P>
<P>Luke&rsquo;s version is not so much the climax to his Gospel as it
is &ldquo;a major turning point in salvation history, inaugurating
the new period of the church and its universal mission. This period
would be covered by the book of Acts.&rdquo; (Reginald H. Fuller in
<EM>The Oxford Companion to the Bibl</EM>e, 365. In other words, for
Luke, the Passion story is only the middle, not the ending of what
Jesus came to do. And so it is for us, despite the sometimes brutal
concentration of attention on the crucifixion as in Gibson&rsquo;s
movie of Jesus&rsquo; twelve last hours.</P>
<P><STRONG>Preaching Points.</STRONG></P>
<P>Most people in the congregation this Sunday will not likely be at
any midweek, Maundy Thursday or Good Friday services. For them the
crucial homiletic opportunity is on Palm or Passion Sunday. How to
make best use of this opportunity presents some difficulty in
choosing the best text and theme for this liturgy and sermon. It
cannot all be done at once. It might best to review the themes used
throughout Lent and bring them toward a natural conclusion. This will
not come this Sunday, of course, but on Easter when we celebration
the Resurrection of our Lord.</P>
<P>Any one of the personalities appearing the Passion narrative may
be used as the focal point of a sermon. Leslie D. Weatherhead&rsquo;s
<EM>Personalities of the Passion</EM>, first published in 1941 and
republished several times would be a helpful resource.</P>
<P>In a recently published work Craig Evans and N.T. Wright have
suggested that the gospel accounts describe with reasonable accuracy
the execution practice of the Romans and the burial practices of the
Jews. [<EM>Jesus, the Final Days: What Really Happened</EM>
(Westminster John Knox, 2009)] While the crucifixion emphasized the
terror of the experience for victims and witnesses alike, the burial
was designed to comfort the mourners that the end of life had come
without any hope of life beyond death.&nbsp; The Pharisees did
believe in resurrection, but they were a&nbsp; minority party at this
time. Most Jews did not share their conviction.</P>
<P>Arguing the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s of the Passion narrative
itself is not advisable. This&nbsp; a time for belief, not lifting up
questions of doubt. The true meaning of the word &ldquo;believe&rdquo;
is not credulously accepting the literal details of the narrative, or
any specific sacrificial or salvationist theology, as the final word
on why Jesus died. To believe means to discover what we mean by the
love that compelled Jesus of Nazareth, Messiah/Christ and Son of God,
to accept his own death by cruel execution as a political&nbsp;
criminal who had committed treason. Does he love me that much? How
then should I love him and show his compassion for those whom he
calls my neighbours?</P>
