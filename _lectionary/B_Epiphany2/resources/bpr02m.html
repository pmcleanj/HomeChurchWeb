<B>1 Samuel</B>
<P>
At one time, the first and second books of Samuel formed a single 
book. They were separated in the Greek translation of the Hebrew 
Scriptures known as the Septuagint (about 250 BC). 1 Samuel begins 
with the story of Samuel: hence the name. 1 Samuel is the first of 
four books which tell the story of Israel's monarchy. Samuel anointed
the first king. We then read about King Saul, and later about David's 
rise to prominence.

<P>Hannah, Samuel&#8217;s mother, barren for many years, has given her son to the service of the Lord in thanksgiving for his gift of a child. He serves Eli in the temple at Shiloh. (Jerusalem is not yet an Israelite city.) For many years (during

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

goes, for God is everywhere; the psalmist couldn&#8217;t escape from God even if he tried (vv.

<B>1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<STRONG>1 Corinthians 6:12-20</STRONG>
<P>In Paul&#8217;s day, Corinth was known for licentiousness. He is concerned that some Christians have gone beyond liberty, that their ways are destroying the community. He quotes a slogan from his opponents: &#8220;All things are lawful for
me&#8221;. (They are saying <EM>I can do anything I like</EM>.) He does not disagree - for Christian living does not depend on observing a set of rules, but on God who accepts even those who break his laws &#8211; but he adds a qualification: some
things may not be &#8220;beneficial&#8221; for the person or in the community. He adds a second qualification: that he will not become enslaved to any indulgence. Christian liberty is not license. V.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+6%3A13" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">13a</A> is a quotation from his
opponents which Paul appears to accept (Christians are not subject to Jewish food laws), but he adds a <EM>rider</EM>: &#8220;and one day God will put an end to both&#8221; (Revised English Bible): both are transitory. But, on the other hand, Paul
says, realizing the Corinthian corollary to the quotation (that desires of the body can be satisfied in any way we wish), the physical and spiritual &#8220;body&#8221; (meaning the whole person and how he lives) is not meant for self-indulgence,
because of the relationship between Christ and each person: our bodies are clearly important to God because, as he has raised Christ, so he will raise us. So his opponents are wrong in their analogy between &#8220;stomach&#8221; and
&#8220;body&#8221;. The body is intended for the service of the Lord.</P>
<P>He continues (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1Corinthians+6%3A15" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>):
surely you are aware of this relationship. In v.

him, and so are his. So how can I possibly unite you with a prostitute, for union occurs in sexual intercourse. Immorality cannot be compartmentalized, for it involves the whole person. So, &#8220;shun fornication!&#8221; (v.

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<STRONG>John 1:43-51</STRONG>
<P>On the previous day, Andrew and Peter, both disciples of John the Baptist, have become Jesus&#8217; disciples. The Baptist has said to them: &#8220;Look, here is the Lamb of God!&#8221; (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+1%3A36" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">36</A>) They have asked Jesus:
&#8220;Where are you staying?&#8221; (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+1%3A38" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">38</A>, where do you dwell?); he has

gospel, <EM>come and believe</EM>. It was Andrew who found Peter. Philip finds Nathanael (probably <EM>Bartholomew</EM> of the other gospels), and tells him that the three have found the one to whom the Old Testament points, i.e. Jesus, the Messiah
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+1%3A45" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">45</A>). Nathanael&#8217;s response

the people of Nazareth were despised. Philip says &#8220;Come and see&#8221;, as Jesus did to Andrew and Peter. An &#8220;Israelite&#8221; (v.

Nathanael is a &#8220;truly an Israelite&#8221; because, unlike other Jews, he accepts Christ. Jacob, the father of the nation, practised deceit before meeting God, but in Nathanael &#8220;there is no deceit&#8221;. In v.

who he is &#8211; in Jewish terms, because of the <EM>minor miracle</EM> of Jesus observing him under a fig tree on a previous occasion, before they met. Jesus tells him that he will see a much greater miracle: like the one Jacob saw in his dream at
Bethel (Genesis <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Genesis+28%3A10-17" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">28:10-17</A>), but
with the Son of Man, Jesus, being the vehicle of communication. In today&#8217;s psalm, God knows our doings; here Jesus knows Nathanael.</P>
