the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for late Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Grace
be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Behold,
he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
of him. Even so, Amen.</I></P>

time, the first and second books of Samuel formed a single book. They
were separated in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures
known as the Septuagint (about 250 BC). 1 Samuel begins with the
story of Samuel: hence the name. 1 Samuel is the first of four books
which tell the story of Israel's monarchy. Samuel anointed the first
king. We then read about King Saul, and later about David's rise to
prominence. </FONT></FONT>

time before the monarchy, Elkanah is on his annual pilgrimage to the
temple at Shiloh. He has taken his two wives and Peninnah&rsquo;s
children with him. There he participates in a sacrificial meal. God
has made Hannah childless (v. 5b); in spite of this, Elkanah &ldquo;loved
her&rdquo; and gave her &ldquo;a double portion&rdquo; of food and
drink. &ldquo;Her rival&rdquo; (v. 6), Peninnah (v. 4), has taunted
her over her barrenness for many years. In spite of her husband&rsquo;s
love and considerate attitude towards her, she has reached the point
where she can take it no longer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This
year, after the meal, Hannah goes to the entrance of the temple,
where she meets Eli, the priest. (The Jerusalem Temple was yet to be
built.) She prays to God and makes a vow: if God will grant her a
son, she will make him a &ldquo;nazirite&rdquo; (v. 11), a person
dedicated (consecrated) to God who will refrain from drink, and not
allow his head to be shaved. A first-born son was always dedicated to
God, but Hannah offers more: </FONT></FONT>

was usually aloud, so Eli (knowing that all have been drinking)
thinks Hannah&rsquo;s silence in prayer is because she is drunk (vv.
13-14). She answers him very coherently (vv. 15-16). Eli realizes his
error of judgement, and intercedes with God on her behalf (v.17). She
trusts in God to grant her wish (v. 18). After returning home, Samuel
is born to her and Elkanah. Hannah does fulfill her promise. When
Samuel is weaned, she takes him to Eli in the temple and gives him to
the Lord (v. 24). Samuel is God&rsquo;s gift to an oppressed woman;
his life is God&rsquo;s gift, and in return his mother gives his life
to God (vv. 27-28).</FONT></FONT></P>

is leaving Samuel with Eli, but before heading home with Elkanah, she
recites a prayer of thanksgiving. But look at vv. 9-10: what do these
verses have to do with Samuel? Scholars agree that an editor has
inserted a much later prayer into older material: the notions of
guarding the faithful and cutting off (condemning) the wicked are
post-exilic (after 450 BC). Notice &ldquo;king&rdquo; in v. 10:
either this refers to the monarchy (which did not exist) or it is
speaking of a future ideal king, a messiah. But look again: note
&ldquo;enemies&rdquo; (v. 1), &ldquo;victory&rdquo;, &ldquo;adversaries&rdquo;
(v. 10). Hannah has at most one </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">enemy</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">,
Peninnah. In Hebrew poetry, an individual (&rdquo;I&rdquo;, v. 1) may
speak on behalf of the nation: here Hannah speaks on behalf of
Israel. At the time, Israel was a small struggling nation with
powerful enemies. The editor makes a theological point: God controls
the destiny of humankind in every age (v. 6); the story of Samuel is
an example. Further, God reverses fortunes: see vv. 4, 5, 7 and 8.
The number &ldquo;seven&rdquo; (v. 5) symbolizes completion and
perfection, so Samuel is a perfect blessing from the Lord. Hannah is
raised up but Peninnah is brought low. God can do this because he is
omnipotent; even the pillars on which the earth was thought to rest
are God&rsquo;s.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">When
the millennium approached, many people were concerned about the
corruption of society and the pending end of the world. Such fears
are not new; they extend back 2200 years to the book of Daniel.
Before Daniel, Jewish prophecy was analogous; it could be clearly
interpreted. Full of obscure symbols that can be interpreted many
different ways, Daniel is one of the first books that includes
&quot;apocalyptic&quot; visions as prophecy. And Daniel's concern
focused on the &quot;day of the Lord&quot; (i.e., Judgement Day).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Even
in a time of great stress, Daniel emphasizes God's protection in the
person of Michael (the archangel) [1]. But, what of the righteous who
died and did not receive protection? Here, Daniel introduces the
concepts of the resurrection and the final judgement [2]. Notice, the
evil would be shamed as their punishment, while the faithful would
have reputations &quot;like the stars in the sky,&quot; bright and
forever [3]. The just (i.e., the faithful) have a place in the
creation (&quot;the firmament&quot;) like the stars. Daniel connected
moral living with God's creation; at the end of time, everything,
including morality, would be set &quot;right.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Daniel
saw the unity of nature and morality in a way that Western culture
easily overlooks. But we should not make connection in terms of
karma, the eternal payback. God's judgement is his mercy and his
love; these are the divine qualitites we believe in, not in moral
retribution as a &quot;law of the universe.&quot; Daniel saw the
connection between creation and morality in God. The only way to live
that connection is in a faith relationship.</FONT></FONT></P>

12 carries all kinds of apocalyptic&mdash;end times-- overtones. Like
Mark 13, Daniel 12 paints a picture of a time to come that will shake
the earth: &ldquo;There shall be a time of anguish such has never
occurred since nations first came into existence (Daniel 12:1). Jesus
tells the disciples not to &ldquo;be alarmed&rdquo; as they
experience war and rumor of war. Daniel provides a similar word. He
gives the assurance that those who have been &ldquo;chosen&rdquo;--
those whose names are in &ldquo;the book&rdquo;-- will survive even
through the most foreboding of times. <BR><BR>Daniel, like Mark, also
gives a word of judgment. Mark indicates later in chapter 13 that &ldquo;if
the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved&rdquo;
(13:20). God&rsquo;s wrath is a fearful wrath; God&rsquo;s righteous
anger cuts through any human pretension. Daniel indicates that &ldquo;many
of those who sleep . . . shall awake . . .some to shame and
everlasting contempt.&rdquo; The judgment of God is nothing to fool
around with. God expects something from his people, even in the last
days. God looks for &ldquo;those who are wise&rdquo; (12:2). They who
know their future lies in the &ldquo;book&rdquo;, in God&rsquo;s
judgment and grace, are they who will &ldquo;shine like the
brightness of the sky&rdquo; (12:3). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
these verses, the author of Hebrews concluded his exposition about
sacrifice. As he did before, the author compared the earthly cult of
the Temple in Jerusalem with the heavenly worship of Jesus which
began on the cross. Both types of sacrifice were continuous. The
earthly cult offered the same sacrifices over and over. In this
sense, it was impotent, for it could not affect what it asked:
reconciliation and intimacy with God. The heavenly cult of Jesus was
also continuous, but in a different sense. The death of Jesus on the
cross was a one time event. But the reality of that event, found in
the risen body of the Lord, would live forever.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">To
truly appreciate the thinking in Hebrews, we must once again see what
kept people from a lasting, intimate relationship with God: death.
The earthly cult of the Temple could never overcome death. This was
why it could not take away the cause of death: sin. But, with the
death and resurrection of Jesus, death itself was destroyed and, by
extension, its cause.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Belief
in the Risen Lord connected one to his eternal life. With such life
now a reality, the author looked forward to the destruction of those
who aligned themselves with sin and death (i.e., non-believers).
These would be the enemies &ldquo;as a stool under his feet.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Some
might mock us for our trust in someone who died two millennia ago.
This was the same scepticism that Jewish-Christians faced when they
held onto their faith in the face of the destruction of the Temple.
The gloomy outlook of the world, critics claim, is enough to argue
against faith. Believers, however, view the outlook AS a reason for
faith. We reach out to the One beyond us, because the world is not
enough. And he gives us true, everlasting life.</FONT></FONT></P>

13 provides a harsh word: &ldquo;This is but the beginning of the
birthpangs&rdquo; (13:8). Hebrews reminds God&rsquo;s people once
more that the &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; of God (10:13) have been put
under Christ&rsquo;s jurisdiction, &ldquo;a footstool for his feet.&rdquo;
(10:13). The future is assured not because of a never-ending,
cyclical effort to appease God. The future is assured because Christ
has &ldquo;offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins.&rdquo;
Forgiveness comes once and for all in Christ. No hard work in the
end-times can earn God&rsquo;s mercy; no repeated offering for sin
can own it. Forgiveness of sin is given once-- for all sin and for
all time--in Christ. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

from the concluding verses (which may have been added later), this
book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a letter. Its name comes
from its approach to Christianity: it is couched is Judaic terms. The
identity of the author is unknown; Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only
God knows&quot; who wrote Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate
analysis, arguing for the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of
Christ as revealer and mediator of God's grace. Basing his argument
on the Old Testament, the author argues for the superiority of Christ
to the prophets, angels and Moses. Christ offers a superior
priesthood, and his sacrifice is much more significant than that of
Levite priests. Jesus is the &quot;heavenly&quot; High Priest, making
the true sacrifice for the sins of the people, but he is also of the
same flesh and blood as those he makes holy. </FONT></FONT>

sacrificial ritual was worthless, unlike Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;single
sacrifice&rdquo; (v. 12): after Jesus died and rose, he became king.
(Kings &ldquo;sat down&rdquo;, but priests stood.) Since that time,
he has been awaiting the final defeat of his &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;
(v. 13). (The author does not say who they are.) For by offering
himself on the cross he has &ldquo;perfected&rdquo; (v. 14),
completed, the removal of sin from those whom God has &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo;,
made holy, set apart for his service. (Elsewhere salvation will be

over the future again weaves itself through popular culture. After
all, one wants to be left behind! (My apologies to Tim LaHaye).
Uncertainty engulfs those on the fringe with paranoia and colors the
majority with cynicism.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">So,
what's new? For the past two millennia, Christians have looked to the
future and asked, &quot;When, Lord, when?&quot; To this question,
Jesus had an answer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Viewing
the end of time, Jesus saw the event as the visit of the divine King.
God would prepare the visit with cosmic signs and events [24-25] as a
means of announcement. The King would arrive in a way that reflected
his power and reputation (on the clouds); his messengers-criers
(&quot;angels&quot;) would go throughout the known world to gather
all the faithful [26-27]. Remember that the Jewish people had been
displaced throughout the known world because of economic opportunity
or oppression. Jesus implied that the injustice of Jews living on
foreign soil would be corrected during his lifetime [30].</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">How
did his disciples know Jesus spoke the truth? Jesus gave a farming
analogy of the fig tree (green before the summer [29]) to support his
belief in God's immanent judgement. Then he compared God's creation
to his words. Nature changed, but his words would not; they were
eternal and, so, trustworthy 31].</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After
all that, Jesus said that only God knew the day (the time frame) or
the hour (the exact moment) of these events [32]. Doesn't this
contradict his preaching and assurance? To the impatient Westerner,
the answer would seem to be &quot;yes.&quot; But Jesus challenged his
disciples to see the process through God's eyes. These things would
happen in God's time, not ours. The teaching of Jesus challenged both
his audience and our uncertain time to trust God with the future.
Anxiety and paranoia were futile responses to a situation that
requires faith.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">What
themes in popular culture remind you of the Second Coming? What is
your response to them as a Christian?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">When
are you coming, Lord? When!? While we might not be consumed with the
question of the end time, personal anxiety in life will cause us to
ask the question. Jesus' answer to us is the same one he gave his
followers two thousand years ago. Look for signs of his coming in the
chaos of life. And trust in his time of your deliverance. Rest
assured, he will come at the right time!</FONT></FONT></P>

you hear of war and rumors of war, do not be alarmed; this must take
place, but the end is still to come.<BR><BR>Jesus words about the end
times come within the context of his disciples&rsquo; awe at the
temple. They are amazed at the power of humanity, made evident in the
temple&rsquo;s architecture: &ldquo;Look, Teacher, what large stones
and what large buildings!&rdquo; Jesus speaks of a power greater than
that amassed in the building before them. Like the grass that withers
and fades away, even this great building will perish. Stone will fall
over stone; not one piece of one wall will be left to stand. <BR><BR>&ldquo;When
will this be?&rdquo; Peter, James, John and Andrew ask their Lord as
he sits &ldquo;opposite the temple.&rdquo; Jesus seems to indicate
that was not the question to ask. No one particular day can be named
as the day signaling that the power of God has been unleashed, that
the time of last days has begun. The concern of the faithful should
not be that of wondering what this war or that one means. The concern
of the faithful should not be what the uprising of kingdoms
indicates; the rumble of earthquakes signifies; the presence of
overarching hunger foretells. Wars will come, and rumors of them, and
that will be just the beginning. What is important: to keep from
&ldquo;alarm;&rdquo; to depend upon the Spirit for strength
(13:7;11). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died,
the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark,
while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses
the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to understanding who Jesus
was. When other synoptic gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke,
they used the Gospel according to Mark as a source. Mark is most
probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in Acts 12:12: his mother's
house was a meeting place for believers. </FONT></FONT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Mark

1-2, Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple, as the prophets
Micah and Jeremiah had done earlier. (His words were later used
against him.) Did he mean it literally or figuratively? We don&rsquo;t
know. (Both the Temple and the religious system were destroyed in 70
AD.) Then he and his first four disciples visit the Mount of Olives &ndash;
a place mentioned in Zechariah 14:4 as being connected with events at
the end of the era. They ask him: when will the Temple (&ldquo;this&rdquo;,
v. 4) be destroyed? How will we know that the end of the era is near?
