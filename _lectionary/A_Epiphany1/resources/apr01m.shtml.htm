<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 29</strong>
<p>This psalm is probably based on one to the Canaanite god Baal, the
storm God, who brings the annual thunder-storm, the source of fertility
for the land. In Israelite hands it expresses God&#8217;s supremacy and
universal rule. In vv. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+29%3A1-2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">1-2</a>, all other gods are invited 
to acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s supremacy and the glory due to him. (Israel was not yet strictly monotheistic.) Vv.

over the Mediterranean (v.3); it sweeps in to the land, breaking the
tall &#8220;cedars&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+29%3A5" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5</a>), as it advances across southern

<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 10:34-43</strong>
<p>Peter is visiting Cornelius, an officer of the occupying Roman army
and already a believer in God. Peter breaks Jewish law by visiting a
Gentile. The Greek here is rough, full of grammatical errors, unlike
the rest of Acts, so we may well have Peter's unedited words. He tells
the assembled company that God does not favour Jews over others:
anyone, whatever his nationality, who reveres God and lives in unison
with him &#8220;is acceptable to him&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+10%3A35" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">35</a>). In vv.

<b>Matthew</b>
</small><p>
<small>This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <i>sayings</i> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for Quelle.)
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 50 to 60 AD, possibly for a

<strong>Matthew 3:13-17</strong>
<p>John the Baptist has appeared, calling people to repentance, to
turning back to God&#8217;s ways, to the way of life to which Israel
committed herself at Sinai. He tells of the nearness of God&#8217;s kingdom,
the time of complete fulfilment of God&#8217;s promises to humans. A new era,
in which God rules, is almost here! John seeks to dissuade Jesus from
seeking baptism but (in words that we do not fully understand) Jesus
insists: for the present, being baptised by you is to perfectly fulfill
the Father&#8217;s will. In being baptised, Jesus joins the community now
walking in God&#8217;s ways. His baptism shows his continuity with God&#8217;s will
seen in the Old Testament: </p>
