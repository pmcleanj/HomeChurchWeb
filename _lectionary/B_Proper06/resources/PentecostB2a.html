<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to
the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues,
like as of fire, and it rested upon each of them: and they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues,
as the Spirit gave them utterance. </I>

Passage</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">We have been discussing how
the Spirit acts to form us, who were created as individuals with our
own bodies, into one Church that is the Body of Christ. The Hebrew
and Greek words for Spirit, ruach and neuma, also mean &ldquo;wind&rdquo;
and &ldquo;breath&rdquo;. In the story of creation, the wind &ndash;
ruach &ndash; moved across the face of the water and Creation began.
God breathed &ndash; ruach &ndash; into the red clay, and Adam
received the Spirit &ndash; ruach. The Spirit empowers us and we feel
it intimately. But , despite that intimacy, we must realize that *we*
do NOT control the *Spirit*.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
