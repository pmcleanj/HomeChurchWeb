<h2>Have You Arrived Yet? </h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every   time I read about the Transfiguration story I am for some reason reminded   about the myth of Sisyphus.&nbsp; Sisyphus was condemned by the gods   to spend an eternity pushing a boulder up a mountain.&nbsp; As he would   reach the summit of the mountain, the boulder would roll all the way   back down.&nbsp; Sisyphus would then have to walk back down only to   start the whole enterprise over once again.&nbsp; The debate has raged   ever since, could such a life be somehow worthwhile?&nbsp; Is such a   repeated journey a good thing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most   of us can name an experience that seems similar to that of Sisyphus.&nbsp;   I love to get to the bottom of the pile on my desk.&nbsp; I get that   brief feeling that I have somehow arrived.&nbsp; Of course, that is   a short-lived feeling and it all begins again the next day.&nbsp; As   a pastor, if I go with the mindset that I will someday be &ldquo;all caught   up&rdquo; with my work I get depressed.&nbsp; I am best off when I think   of my job as a journey.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   think our faith life is like that as well.&nbsp; When we expect to somehow   arrive in our faith the experience can be similar to that of hitting   one&rsquo;s head against the wall over and over again.&nbsp; If we experience   our faith life as a lifetime journey with many ebbs and flows, we will   escape that familiar pressure of having to &ldquo;arrive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In   this lesson we have another dramatic story as Elijah is taken up into   a heavenly whirlwind.&nbsp; It is good to note that Elijah is taken   up in the midst of the journey and the Elisha will continue the journey.&nbsp;   The story does not rest with Elijah being taken up.&nbsp; Maybe we can   say that Elijah finally arrived.&nbsp; The work of God and that of Elijah   continues with the prophet Elisha.&nbsp; The journey continues.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisha   follows his master to the end and then continues the journey of spreading   the word of God.&nbsp; In our own lives we need to see certain things   come to an end, before we can begin another chapter of our lives.&nbsp;   I even like to ask the question if Elijah&rsquo;s journey ends as he is   taken up be a chariot.&nbsp; Elijah does appear on the mountain of transfiguration.&nbsp;   Will our &ldquo;journey&rdquo; end as we die, or will we still be able to grow   and learn?&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The   glory of Jesus at the transfiguration is &ldquo;clouded&rdquo;, &ldquo;veiled&rdquo;   in comparison to the glory of the resurrected Jesus.&nbsp; The veil   in this lesson covers not only the face, but also the mind and heart   as well.&nbsp; Our calling on the journey is to &ldquo;proclaim Jesus Christ   as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our journey   does not always take us to the heights of mountains.&nbsp; We may also   need to be in the lowly places bearing Christ light in a world in need.&nbsp;</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel Reading</h4>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus   invites Peter, James and John into a life changing moment.&nbsp; Indeed,   they may have wondered if they had finally arrived.&nbsp; On the mountain,   Jesus is transfigured before them; clothed in dazzling white he is changed,   transformed into a vision of glory.&nbsp; There is a culmination of   history bringing together the Law and the Prophets.&nbsp; Standing among   them is Moses, the great teacher of the Law of God and Elijah, the prophet   taken up to heaven on a chariot of fire.&nbsp; All that once held the   hope of the people of Israel is standing before Peter.&nbsp; This most   certainly is an &ldquo;I have arrived&rdquo; moment.&nbsp; There is no doubt   that Peter would not have wanted this moment to end.&nbsp; So Peter   says to Jesus, &ldquo;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three   dwellings, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&rdquo;&nbsp; But   it is not Jesus who responds to Peter.&nbsp; A mysterious cloud covers   them and the very voice of God speaks to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my Son,   the Beloved; listen to him!&rdquo;  &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter,   James and John hadn&rsquo;t arrived.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t stay on the Mountain,   but as they go down they are to listen to Jesus.&nbsp; Peter was trying   to preserve something that could only be temporary.&nbsp; It was truly   an exciting moment, but the journey had to continue. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Mark&rsquo;s Gospel doesn&rsquo;t tell us what Jesus, Moses and Elijah were   talking about.&nbsp; Luke&rsquo;s story of the &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; tells   us they were talking about Jesus&rsquo; departure that he was about to accomplish   in Jerusalem.&nbsp; Moses and Elijah and Jesus were discussing Jesus&rsquo;   impending death and ascension.&nbsp; In Greek, the word translated as   departure is actually Exodus.&nbsp; Moses for one knows a great deal   about Exodus.&nbsp; One learns over 40 years wondering far from home.&nbsp;   It was Moses who in obedience to God&rsquo;s command led the Israelites   on their journey toward liberation&mdash;out of slavery in Egypt and into   God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Promised Land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moses never &ldquo;arrives&rdquo; in the   &ldquo;Promised Land.&rdquo;&nbsp; While it is important to note that the Jews   are liberated from slavery, their journey with God will not end at the   destination of the land flowing with milk and honey.&nbsp;      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our   journey with Jesus is also a journey toward liberation, but he is more   than a second Moses.&nbsp; Now with Jesus&rsquo; exodus, God&rsquo;s rescue   includes us, God&rsquo;s people once again liberated as from slavery, bondage,   all those things that have an unholy hold on us.&nbsp; Jesus becomes   our Passover lamb, placing his own blood on the doorposts of our lives.&nbsp;   Jesus continues to speak with us in our journey.&nbsp; Our journey will   likely lead us in and out of bondage.&nbsp; We are in bondage to sin,   bondage to society, bondage to the media.&nbsp; It is through Christ   that we find liberation.&nbsp; But don't expect to arrive.&nbsp; Expect   Jesus to continue to lead the way through all that life throws.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;What do you think?&nbsp; Will     our journey end when we die or will it be just beginning?</p>
<p>2.Reflect on your own faith     journey so far.&nbsp; What new places is God calling you to enter?&nbsp;     What old beliefs of yours need to be revisited?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;What are those things in your     life that hold you in bondage?&nbsp; What liberating word do you need     to hear from God?</p>
<p>4.  As we enter Lent consider     if you are on a mountaintop or trudging through a valley?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.  How are you transfigured/     transformed by your encounters with God?</p>
<P>6. Is a life without final destination worth living? </P>
