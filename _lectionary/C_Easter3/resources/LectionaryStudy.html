</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to
Luke. Beginning with Jesus' ascension, Luke tells the story of the
beginnings of the church. By no means a comprehensive history, it
does however describe the spread of the church from Jerusalem to all
of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he reports show how
Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of the
struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The
Holy Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through
much of the Roman Empire. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Acts 9:1-6,(7-20)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Luke has told us, in Acts <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+8%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8:3</A>,
that in Jerusalem &ldquo;Saul was ravaging the church by entering
house after house; dragging off both men and women, he committed them
to prison.&rdquo; Now we see his great transformation: from
persecutor to evangelist. At the time, Jews often had two names: a
Semitic one (&ldquo;Saul&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A1" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1</A>)
and a Roman or Greek one (Paul). A scholar says that the Empire
granted Jews the right to extradite their own from beyond Palestine.
Those &ldquo;who belonged to the Way&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A2" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>)
were Jewish Christians; they worshipped in synagogues. In the early
days, Christianity was known as &ldquo;the Way&rdquo;. Paul later
called the glory of God (or Christ) a &ldquo;light&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>).
Vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A4-5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4-5</A>
make it clear that in persecuting members of the Christian flock,
Paul persecuted Christ.</P>
<P>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A7" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">7</A>,
the Greek suggests that Saul&rsquo;s companions heard the sound of
the voice but not what was said. God commands &ldquo;Ananias&rdquo;
(v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>),
a leader of the followers in Damascus, to seek out Saul to restore
his sight. Naturally, Ananias is fearful, Saul being a known enemy of
Christians. In today&rsquo;s terminology, God might say that he had
chosen Paul as a <EM>medium</EM> to convey his <EM>message</EM> (v.
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>).
He will &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A16" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">16</A>),
as Jesus told the eleven apostles they would. Through Ananias, God
restores Paul&rsquo;s sight; Paul receives the Holy Spirit and is
baptised, thus becoming a member of the Church.</P>

<H4>The Apostles Before the Sanhedrin</H4>
<P>5:30: &ldquo;hanging him on a tree&rdquo; This echoed Deuteronomy
21:22-23:</P>
<P>&ldquo;And if a man has committed a crime punishable by death and
he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, his body shall not
remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him the same day,
for a hanged man is accursed by God; you shall not defile your land
which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance.&rdquo; (RSV)</P>
<P>This was a reference to the custom of shaming the executed man and
his relatives before the community, not to the Roman practice of
crucifixion. Still, the irony of the phrase must have stung the
opponents of the apostles.</P>
<P>5:31 &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;First.&rdquo; This
was a title that referred to status, not order in a sequence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;metanoia&rdquo; is the change of mind and heart. It is a
radical change in lifestyle toward God that is translated
&ldquo;repentance.&rdquo;</P>
<P>5:32 This sentence has two subjects: &ldquo;We&rdquo; and the Holy
Spirit. Both witnessed to the events described in 5:30-31.</P>
<P>Just as the Apostles continued the work of Jesus after his
resurrection (their healing ministry and presence in the Temple),
they suffered the persecution of the Sanhedrin (the assembly of
Jewish leaders in Jerusalem). This passage describes the second trial
of the apostles before the Sanhedrin.</P>
<P>The apostles were instructed by the highest religious authority in
Judaism to stop preaching, but the court's order was ignored. In
fact, the apostles accused the Sanhedrin of murdering Jesus [28].</P>
<P>The apostle's answer was simple: appeal to a higher power. In
obedience to the Spirit, the apostles acted as witnesses, proclaiming
what they had seen. God had raised Jesus and made him Savior so that
Israel might receive forgiveness [29-32]. In essence, Peter declared
that God had taken the authority of the Sanhedrin away and had given
it to the Church. In the eyes of the leadership, this was an act of
religious treason!</P>
<P>Missing from the passage is the Sanhedrin's reaction, the desire
for vengeance. But cooler heads prevailed [33-39], so, the apostles
were beaten and given the original order again: do not preach in the
name of Jesus again [40]. Showing inner strength, the apostles
rejoiced; they suffered for Christ, just as Christ suffered for them
[41], and they went out to preach anew.</P>
<P><I>How do we answer God's call? How do we witness to his action in
our lives? Do we accept the &quot;judgment&quot; society to keep
religion a private matter, or do we &quot;proclaim the Good News from
the roof tops?</I></P>

in the minds of those of us on the east side of the Cascades is the
reality that there are no second chances &ndash; at least not in the
NCAA basketball tournament. One loss and you are out. The hopes and
dreams and expectations for a team&rsquo;s performance are
meaningless. This tournament is based purely on the final score.
There are winners and there are losers. This tournament often lacks
justice from the eyes of the fans. There is no mercy and little
grace. <BR><BR>As we watched our beloved Gonzaga Bulldogs fall in the
second round, how we wished that we could play the game over again.
It was like a bad dream and the loss was hard to believe. But the
hardest thing to swallow was that it was all over. It was 40 minutes
that could never be recovered. Overnight the team went from a
household name and nationally ranked phenomenon to a forgotten
prediction. Commentators objectified the young men with statistics
and seemed to forget that they were people apart from the game of
basketball. For good or for ill the entire being of these ball
players gets summed up in their performance on any given night.<BR><BR>Much
of our world operates on a &ldquo;one strike&rdquo; basis. Life can
seem to be a single elimination event. Yet Jesus demonstrates an
alternative to this &ldquo;one strike&rdquo; system. His patience
with Peter reveals a system that not only allows for but also creates
the opportunity for beginning again. <BR><BR>Peter&rsquo;s actions in
the Gospel accounts can leave us asking, &ldquo;Why is this block
head the one on which you want to build your church?&rdquo; It seems
that his name should mean &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; because his head is
filled with them. He never seems to get things right and he is always
the one that risks revealing his lack of understanding. Apparently
Peter did not know the wise notion that, &ldquo;it is better to
remain silent and let people wonder how stupid you are than to speak
and remove all doubt.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s actions repeatedly betray
his best intentions.<BR><BR>In the last chapter of John&rsquo;s
Gospel, Jesus sets aside Peter&rsquo;s previous failures at
faithfulness &ndash; most recently his threefold betrayal. Peter&rsquo;s
performance and statistics are not allowed to paint the total picture
of the man. Jesus addresses him as Simon as he did in chapter 3 when
the first disciples are called. Jesus again calls him saying, &ldquo;Follow
me.&rdquo; It is with these words that Simon, the son of John who is
called Peter, begins again as a disciple of the Messiah. Peter lives
and follows the One whose death and resurrection gives the grace for
us all to begin again. Peter will know that not only his career as a
disciple but also his very life ends at the beginning. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Stories
of dramatic conversions are not all that common in Lutheran circles.
Yet, our churches are seeing an increase in adult baptisms. I think
the impression is often that those who are baptized or become members
of a parish are simply moving from a neutral position to a faithful
position. I have yet to hear anyone identify themselves at an adult
catechism class or new member class as a former &ldquo;persecutor of
the church.&rdquo; Often people describe themselves as having fallen
out of the practice of worshipping and participating in the life of a
congregation or to simply have existed without feeling any need for
the faith or church before. This is not the case for Saul (Paul). He
is &lsquo;still breathing threats and murder against the disciples.&rsquo;
- hardly a neutral position. It is a position that leaves him struck
down by light (ning), hearing the voice of God and blinded &ndash;
hardly a neutral response.<BR><BR>There are several details that
reveal the narrative unity between Luke and Acts. In the
transfiguration account in ch. 9 we hear the voice from heaven and
the glory in which Jesus is shown is often understood as bright
light. The blind man is healed in ch. 18. The Holy Spirit is bestowed
on Saul and plays a vital role as in Luke. It is interesting that
Saul goes on to preach Jesus as the Son of God &ndash; this is the
title given to him by the council in Luke 22. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<P>The psalmist clearly praises God for his recovery from grave
illness, but this psalm may also be allegorical: its title says that
it was sung at the dedication of the Temple, which was desecrated in
164 BC and rededicated in 161 BC. &ldquo;Sheol&rdquo;, &ldquo;the
Pit&rdquo;, (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+30%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3</A>)

God, pointing out that if allowed to go the Sheol, no one, not even
God, could hear him. God did hear his prayer and restored him to

It tells of the struggle between good and evil, and the ultimate

<P><STRONG>Revelation 5:11-14</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>This book is an inspired <EM>picture-book</EM>, intended to make a
powerful appeal to the reader&rsquo;s imagination. Using a literary
genre known as <EM>apocalyptic</EM>, John gives us an insight into
what will occur at the end of the current era. In his vision, he sees
God&rsquo;s throne and the heavenly scene around it and hears the
praises sung there. He describes the glory of God in terms of
precious gems (<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4:3</A>).

perhaps the twelve Old Testament patriarchs and the twelve apostles),
so an image of the ideal Church. As in a Roman court, God&rsquo;s
counsellors are &ldquo;seated&rdquo;: they share in ruling and

a valuable commodity in John&rsquo;s day, suggests the distance
between humans and God, even in heaven. The &ldquo;four living

5:11-14</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<H4>Praise to the Lamb!</H4>
<P>5:11 &ldquo;the (four) living ones and the (twenty four)
presbyters&rdquo; The number of the living creatures and the
presbyters was mentioned in 5:8.</P>
<P>&ldquo;the number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of
thousands&rdquo; In other words, the number was uncountable. A
&ldquo;myriad&rdquo; is ten thousand in New Testament Greek.</P>
<P>5:12, 13 &ldquo;honor&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;(high) value.&rdquo;</P>
<P>5:13 &ldquo;All creation&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;every
creature.&rdquo; The three levels of creation (heaven, earth, and the
underworld) along with the watery depths, AND every creature give
praise to God (the One enthroned) and to the Lamb, the title for
Christ.</P>
<P>These verses denoted the praise and worship that everyone gave as
the scroll with the seven seals was received by the Christ figure
(5:1). There has been much speculation as to the meaning and the
content of the scroll (the &ldquo;Book of Life&rdquo; or God&rsquo;s
plan for creation). In any case the scroll has writing on both sides,
like the hand written Torah scrolls found in synagogues. The only one
worthy to open the scroll was the &ldquo;Lion of Judah, the
(victorious) Root of Jesse.&rdquo;</P>
<P>After the Christ figure received the scroll, there were three
praises listed. The first praise was directed toward the Christ
figure who was worthy to open the scroll because of the suffering he
endured and the Kingdom of saints he created (5:9-10).</P>
<P>The second and third praises can be found in this reading. The
throne (representing the presence of God) was surrounded by four
&ldquo;living ones&rdquo; and twenty four elders (&ldquo;presbyters&rdquo;).
The &ldquo;living ones&rdquo; were angelic &ldquo;messengers,&rdquo;
those who personified the divine presence and manifest the divine
power. The elders were saint-kings who ruled creation along with the
One enthroned; their number (24 or 2 x 12) represented a fullness of
God&rsquo;s people (two leaders for each of the twelve tribes of
Israel). The &ldquo;living ones&rdquo; and the elders sang the first
praise. Surrounding them were an uncountable number of spiritual
powers and beings. These joined with the &ldquo;living ones&rdquo;
and the elders in the second praise. All three groups, this
manifestation of the Kingdom, praised the Christ figure again with an
song that was meant to be eternal (&ldquo;into ages of ages&rdquo;).</P>
<P>The last praise was sung response by creation itself (as the note
above discussed). The praise was directed in general toward God and
the Lamb. The final response was agreement by the &ldquo;living ones&rdquo;
and worship by the elders. This drew the reception ceremony to a
close.</P>
<P>While the Book of Revelation may be mysterious with its emphasis
on symbols, the context for the symbols should not cause wonder. The
context was worship. John the Elder witnessed heavenly praise. The
kind that we should emulate. The kind that, if we look closely, we
can easily imagine creation itself offering to its maker.</P>
<P>Let us praise God. And his Son. They are truly worthy.</P>
<P><I>In this season of Easter, make a habit of daily praise time.
That would be a nice counterbalance to the spiritual exercises found
in Lent.</I></P>

<P>Since his resurrection, Jesus has twice appeared to the disciples
in the house where he hosted the Last Supper. Now he appears to six
disciples near the Sea of Galilee (&ldquo;Tiberias&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A1" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">1</A>).
Led by Peter, they go fishing but catch nothing. When they return to
the shore in the morning, Jesus is there. When he invites them to
cast their net again, they catch many fish (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A6" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">6</A>).

Peter avoids comparisons with &ldquo;these&rdquo;, the other

freedom of movement we had when young. But Peter&rsquo;s life will be
cut short: he will either be bound a prisoner or crucified (&ldquo;stretch

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The
Catch, the Meal, and the Commitment</FONT></FONT></H4>
<P><I>What are you planning for vacation this summer?</I></P>
<P>It's almost vacation time! Time to indulge hobbies, time to share
leisurely meal, time to renew relationships. For some, half the fun
is planning the vacation. For others, half the fun is being with
others on vacation. No matter. It's a time to escape the mundane,
high-pressured existence to find a sense of self.</P>
<P>After the resurrection, Peter and his companions left the pressure
of Jerusalem for their quiet roots in Galilee. There, doing what they
did best, they encountered the Lord. In symbols that would paint the
way they evangelized.</P>
<P>In this touching post-resurrectional narrative, the echoes of
three gospel scenes weave together: the great catch of fish in the
call of Simon Peter, the feed of the multitude with bread and fish,
Peter's denial.</P>
<P>21:4 Why didn't the disciples know it was Jesus? The appearance of
Jesus (and the recognition of his presence) belongs to divine
initiative. It is not in the power of people to recognize the
presence and activity of God. Such a recognition depends upon grace.</P>
<P>21:5 &quot;Young friends&quot; is literally &quot;Children&quot;
(as in &quot;small boys&quot;). To an adult male, this might be
considered a putdown. However, in John's first letter, the neutral
term &quot;Children&quot; (can be male or female) is used 12 times as
a term of endearment for Christians. While the connection of the
author of John's gospel with the author of 1 John might be in
dispute, the term was used in the early Christian communities.</P>
<P>21:7 &quot;tucked in his outer garment [for he was lightly clothed
(as he fished)] &quot; is literally &quot;belted his outer garment
[for he was naked].&quot; The text indicates Peter fished naked, then
threw a belt around an out garment before he jumped into the water.
The context, however, makes this interpretation suspect. Peter, like
his contemporaries, wore clothing in layers, more in the cold
evening, fewer in the hot day. Most likely, as Peter and his
companions fished throughout the cold night, he would have been
clothed with the maximum number of layers to retain heat. As the dawn
broke and the temperature rose, Peter took off his outer garment to
remain comfortable. (The term &quot;naked&quot; can also be
translated &quot;lightly clothed&quot; or &quot;clothed in
undergarments.&quot;) When Peter prepared to jump in the water, he
tied or tucked the outer garment in to keep it from getting wet. The
verse indicated Peter dressed to meet the Lord.</P>
<P>Unlike the other resurrection stories found in the Gospels, this
appearance took place in Galilee, at the so-called &quot;Sea of
Galilee&quot; (which actually was a lake). In this story it is known
as the &quot;Sea of Tiberias&quot; named in honor of the Emperor [1].
There are seven disciples in the story: Peter (the leader), the sons
of Zebedee (James and John), Nathaniel (an early disciple who Jesus
chose in John 1:45-50), Thomas (the doubter), and two others [2]. For
Jews, the number seven represented fullness, so there was a
&quot;fullness&quot; of the community present.</P>
<P>According to good business practice, Peter went fishing with the
others at night. But they did not catch anything [3]. Reminiscent of
Jesus' call to Peter at the beginning of his Galilean ministry, Jesus
greeted the community at dawn and ordered them to cast their nets
over the side. Such a great number of fish were caught, they had to
be dragged to the shore [4-8].</P>
<P>Like much of John, these few sentences were packed with symbolism.
The boat was an old symbol for the church; fishing at night
represented a failing missionary effort. It must have felt like the
night Jesus was dead in the tomb. But with the dawn, the Risen Lord
was present, and with him came the great number of new Christians
(represented by the great number of fish). According to some early
Christian writers, the number of fish (153 in verse 11) represented
all the known species in the world at the time; these fish
represented all the peoples of the world, where the missionary effort
should go (see Matt. 13:47-50). With the great catch, the Lord was
recognized.</P>
<P>Bringing the catch with them, Peter and the disciples joined Jesus
for breakfast of bread and fish [9-13]. A breakfast meal with the
Risen Lord should have been Eucharist (bread and wine) but a meal of
bread and fish was part of the early Christian tradition. The
multiplication of the loaves and the fish (Matt. 14:15-21 &amp;
15:32-38, Mark 6:35-44 &amp; 8:1-8, Luke 9:12-17, and John 5:6-13),
the appearance of the Risen Lord eating fish as a proof of the
resurrection (Luke 24:41-43) and early Christian art in the catacombs
(images of Jesus sharing bread and fish with his followers) were
powerful witnesses to this tradition.</P>
<P>What did the meal mean to the early Christian community? As you
read above, the fish represented new believers; the meal then
represented the initiation of Christians, as they were incorporated
into Christ and the community (represented by Christ and the
community eating the fish). The image was Eucharist in reverse;
instead of the believer consuming Christ in the Eucharist, the new
believer is consumed by Christ. The inclusion of new believers into
the Body of Christ (i.e., the community) brought new life (just as
eating fish brought strength and nourishment to the body). The image
of the bread and fish pointed out the close connection between
Eucharist (bread) and baptism (fish). Scholars speculate that the
Church leadership had a meal of fish and bread to celebrate the
initiation of new Christians into the community.</P>
<P>Why don't we celebrate this meal today? In the ancient society,
fish could be kept only for a limited time and traded only over a
limited distance. When the disciples left the area of Galilee (where
fish was a food staple) and moved into the Mediterranean world of the
Roman empire, the meal could only be celebrated in the coastal areas.
As the Church grew to inland areas, fish was not readily available.
So the tradition quickly died out.</P>
<P>21:15-17 John used different wording to drive home the same point.
Jesus asked for loving devotion (&quot;agape&quot; in 21:15-16) and
companionship (&quot;phileo&quot; in 21:17). Peter retorted,
insisting Jesus knew of his commitment (&quot;phileo&quot; in all
three verses). Jesus responded with &quot;grazing&quot; the lambs in
21:15, &quot;shepherding&quot; the sheep in 21:16, and &quot;grazing&quot;
the sheep in 21:17. Because the images are so close and the language
in John is so loose, the words for love are synonymous, as well as
the activity of the shepherd.</P>
<P>21:18 &quot;you belted yourself and walked around where you
wanted&quot; Belting one's outer garment was the final step to
prepare for the day's activities outside the home. The phrase
referred to self initiative and independent mobility. It is a sly
reference to 21:7 when Peter &quot;belted himself&quot; and swam to
see the Lord.</P>
<P>21:18-19 Jesus used a proverb to indicate the death of Peter.
According to tradition, Peter was martyred. Whether the description
used in the proverb literally or figuratively referred to the way
Peter died (upside down on a cross in the Caesar's circus yard in the
Vatican) is a matter of dispute. However, command to love and to
follow Jesus that acted as bookends to this proverb made it clear
that Peter was to act as Jesus and follow Jesus on the road that led
to death (and to resurrection).</P>
<P>The balance of the reading redressed Peter's denial of Jesus
before his death. The Risen Lord asked Peter three times about his
devotion; three times Peter professed his love for the Lord; three
times, Christ instructed Peter to feed the followers [15-17].
Confirming Peter's choice, Jesus used an old proverb as a prophecy
for Peter's death; when he was young, he was free, but now he has
made his choice, he must live with the consequences of that choice
[18-19]. Like Peter, a Christian's life of faith and service leads to
death (to the world) and a new life (in Christ and his community).</P>
<P><I>No matter whether the believer is new or old, a pew sitter or a
leader, the call of Christ is the same: &quot;Follow me.&quot;
Following Christ means evangelization and life in the community. Are
we, like Peter, spreading the net for new believers and professing a
true love for our Savior? Or are we on the sidelines watching others
doing the work of the Church?</I></P>
<P>As you plan for your vacation this summer, remember the story of
Peter and his friends. The way they spent their time, the way they
celebrated their friendship (and devotion to the Lord), and the way
they renewed their friendship spoke volumes about the level of their
discipleship. Fishing, breakfast, and &quot;discussions&quot; may
form a wonderful vacation. With the Lord, they can form unforgettable
experiences that change us forever.</P>
<P><I>Begin to plan your vacation with prayer and plans to include
the Lord on your journeys. </I>
