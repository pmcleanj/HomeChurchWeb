<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 9:1-6,(7-20)</strong>
<p>Luke has told us, in Acts <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+8%3A3">8:3</a>,
that in Jerusalem &#8220;Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after
house; dragging off both men and women, he committed them to prison.&#8221;
Now we see his great transformation: from persecutor to evangelist. At
the time, Jews often had two names: a Semitic one (&#8220;Saul&#8221;, v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A1">1</a>)
and a Roman or Greek one (Paul). A scholar says that the Empire granted
Jews the right to extradite their own from beyond Palestine. Those &#8220;who
belonged to the Way&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A2">2</a>)
were Jewish Christians; they worshipped in synagogues. In the early
days, Christianity was known as &#8220;the Way&#8221;. Paul later called the glory
of God (or Christ) a &#8220;light&#8221; (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A3">3</a>). Vv. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A4-5">4-5</a> make it clear that in 
persecuting members of the Christian flock, Paul persecuted Christ.</p>
<p>In v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A7">7</a>, the Greek suggests that 
Saul&#8217;s companions heard the sound of the voice but not what was said. God commands &#8220;Ananias&#8221; (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A10">10</a>),
a leader of the followers in Damascus, to seek out Saul to restore his
sight. Naturally, Ananias is fearful, Saul being a known enemy of
Christians. In today&#8217;s terminology, God might say that he had chosen
Paul as a <em>medium</em> to convey his <em>message</em> (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A15">15</a>). He will &#8220;suffer&#8221; (v. 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+9%3A16">16</a>),
as Jesus told the eleven apostles they would. Through Ananias, God
restores Paul&#8217;s sight; Paul receives the Holy Spirit and is baptised,
thus becoming a member of the Church.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<hr>
<strong>Psalm 30</strong>
<p>The psalmist clearly praises God for his recovery from grave
illness, but this psalm may also be allegorical: its title says that it
was sung at the dedication of the Temple, which was desecrated in 164
BC and rededicated in 161 BC. &#8220;Sheol&#8221;, &#8220;the Pit&#8221;, (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+30%3A3">3</a>) was thought of as a place under 
the earth where the dead existed as mere shadows. In vv.

present to join in giving thanks. In vv.

to him. He had felt perfectly secure and healthy (v.

from him) &#8211; he became ill. Feeling near death, he prayed to God,
pointing out that if allowed to go the Sheol, no one, not even God,
could hear him. God did hear his prayer and restored him to health and
favour (vv. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+30%3A11-12">11-12</a>): his sorrow was turned 
to joy, even to liturgical &#8220;dancing&#8221;. He will praise God for the rest of his life.</p>

<b>Revelation</b>
</small><p>
<small>This is the last book of the Bible and is in a way a summary of the whole of 
the Bible. It is an apocalypse, a vision which foretells the future and 
presents an understanding of the past. It tells of the struggle between good 
and evil, and the ultimate victory of Christ. Writing in symbolic language, 
its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of persecution. It is 
hard to understand because we do not know the meaning of the symbols (e.g. 
animals) it uses.

<strong>Revelation 5:11-14</strong>
<p>This book is an inspired <em>picture-book</em>, intended to make a powerful appeal to the reader&#8217;s imagination. Using a literary genre known as <em>apocalyptic</em>,
John gives us an insight into what will occur at the end of the current
era. In his vision, he sees God&#8217;s throne and the heavenly scene around
it and hears the praises sung there. He describes the glory of God in
terms of precious gems (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A3">4:3</a>). Around God&#8217;s throne 
are &#8220;twenty-four elders&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A4">4:4</a>,
perhaps the twelve Old Testament patriarchs and the twelve apostles),
so an image of the ideal Church. As in a Roman court, God&#8217;s counsellors
are &#8220;seated&#8221;: they share in ruling and judging. &#8220;lightning&#8221; (<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A5">4:5</a>)
and &#8220;thunder&#8221; express God&#8217;s majesty. The &#8220;seven spirits&#8221; before the
throne may be the seven angels of high rank, as in 1 Enoch, a
non-biblical apocalyptic book. Tobit <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Tobit+12%3A15">12:15</a> speaks of Raphael as 
&#8220;one of the seven angels who ... enter before ... the glory of the Lord&#8221;. The &#8220;sea of glass&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A6">4:6</a>),
a valuable commodity in John&#8217;s day, suggests the distance between
humans and God, even in heaven. The &#8220;four living creatures&#8221; around the
throne are angelic beings representing the whole of creation (Ezekiel
1:5,10); they are God&#8217;s agents who watch over all of nature (Ezekiel <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Ezekiel+1%3A18">1:18</a>,

and symbolize what is most splendid about animals: nobility (lion),
strength (ox), wisdom (human), and oversight (eagle). Representing
earthly beings, they continually praise God as ruler of history (or
time). He will restore (or liberate) creation (&#8220;is to come&#8221;, <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A8">4:8</a>). They are 
joined by the &#8220;elders&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+4%3A10">4:10</a>), representing heavenly 
beings, who acknowledge God&#8217;s superior power by placing their crowns &#8220;before the throne&#8221; &#8211; that all power comes from God.</p>
<p>Next a &#8220;scroll&#8221; 
(<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+5%3A1">5:1</a>) is presented &#8211; a 
record of God&#8217;s plans for the end-time: see Daniel 
<a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Daniel+10%3A21">10:21</a>. No one is found worthy to 
open the scroll and reveal its contents

<p>In a scene reminiscent of the honours given to a Roman emperor,
large numbers sing of Christ&#8217;s worthiness to disclose God&#8217;s plans.
There are seven honours he is worthy to receive (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Revelation+5%3A12">12</a>):

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 21:1-19</strong>
<p>Since his resurrection, Jesus has twice appeared to the disciples in
the house where he hosted the Last Supper. Now he appears to six
disciples near the Sea of Galilee (&#8220;Tiberias&#8221;, v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A1">1</a>).
Led by Peter, they go fishing but catch nothing. When they return to
the shore in the morning, Jesus is there. When he invites them to cast
their net again, they catch many fish (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A6">6</a>). One (probably John) recognizes 
him now (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A7">7</a>); the others do later.

on the fire (v. <a onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+21%3A9">9</a>), but it leads into

&#8220;these&#8221;, the other disciples. Jesus asks three times &#8211; a reversal of Peter&#8217;s denial of him; each time Jesus tells him: <em>feed/tend my lambs/sheep</em>. V.

begins with a proverbial saying: in old age, we lack the mobility and
freedom of movement we had when young. But Peter&#8217;s life will be cut
short: he will either be bound a prisoner or crucified (&#8220;stretch out
