						<h4>The Apostles Before the Sanhedrin</h4>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>27
The guards led the apostles into the hall and made them stand before
the council of religious leaders. 28 The high priest began the
questioning, &#8220;We gave you very strict orders not to teach in the name
of Jesus. But, no! You have filled Jerusalem with your teachings about
him. And, you insist on blaming us for his death!&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>29
&#8220;It&#8217;s more important to obey God than men,&#8221; Peter and the apostles
answered. &#8220;You abused Jesus and even hanged him on a tree to die. But,
the God of our ancestors raised him from the dead. 31 God brought Jesus
up to sit right next to him. And he made Jesus our Leader and Savior.
That way, Jesus could turn Israel back to God and forgive their sins.
32 We are eye witnesses to our own words. The Holy Spirit is also our
witness. He is the one God gave to everyone who obeys him!&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>40
Later, the apostles were brought back into the hall. The leaders had
them beaten and ordered the apostles never to speak about Jesus ever
again. Then, they released them. 41 But, the apostles left the leaders
happy that they were worthy to be mistreated because of the name of
Jesus.</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>27
Having led them (in), (the guards) stood (the apostles) in (the midst
of) the council. 28 The high priest questioned them, saying, &#8220;[No,]
with (this) command, we command you not to teach in this NAME, and,
Behold! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to
bring the blood of (this) man upon us. 29 Having answered, Peter and
the apostles said, &#8220;It is necessary (for us) to obey God more than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you (completely and
violently) handled, hanging him on a tree. 31 To his right (hand), God
elevated this ONE as Leader and Savior, to give metanoia to Israel and
the forgiving of sins. 32 We are witnesses to these words, (along with)
the Holy Spirit, the (One) that God gave to those obeying him.&#8221;</b></p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>39c
(The council) was convinced by (Gamaliel) 40 and, having called in the
apostles, having (them) beaten, they ordered (the apostles) not to
speak in the name of Jesus, and they released (them). 41 But, indeed,
the (apostles) walked from the presence of the council rejoicing,
because they were worthy to be shamed on behalf of the NAME...</b></p>
						<p class="indent">5:30: &#8220;hanging him on a tree&#8221; This echoed Deuteronomy 21:22-23:</p>
						<p class="indent">&#8220;And
if a man has committed a crime punishable by death and he is put to
death, and you hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night
upon the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is
accursed by God; you shall not defile your land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> your God gives you for an inheritance.&#8221; (RSV)</p>
						<p class="indent">This
was a reference to the custom of shaming the executed man and his
relatives before the community, not to the Roman practice of
crucifixion. Still, the irony of the phrase must have stung the
opponents of the apostles.</p>
						<p class="indent">5:31 &#8220;Leader&#8221; is literally &#8220;First.&#8221; This was a title that referred to status, not order in a sequence.</p>
						<p class="indent">&#8220;metanoia&#8221; is the change of mind and heart. It is a radical change in lifestyle toward God that is translated &#8220;repentance.&#8221;</p>
						<p class="indent">5:32 This sentence has two subjects: &#8220;We&#8221; and the Holy Spirit. Both witnessed to the events described in 5:30-31.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Just
as the Apostles continued the work of Jesus after his resurrection
(their healing ministry and presence in the Temple), they suffered the
persecution of the Sanhedrin (the assembly of Jewish leaders in
Jerusalem). This passage describes the second trial of the apostles
before the Sanhedrin.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The apostles were
instructed by the highest religious authority in Judaism to stop
preaching, but the court's order was ignored. In fact, the apostles
accused the Sanhedrin of murdering Jesus [28].</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
apostle's answer was simple: appeal to a higher power. In obedience to
the Spirit, the apostles acted as witnesses, proclaiming what they had
seen. God had raised Jesus and made him Savior so that Israel might
receive forgiveness [29-32]. In essence, Peter declared that God had
taken the authority of the Sanhedrin away and had given it to the
Church. In the eyes of the leadership, this was an act of religious
treason!</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Missing from the passage is the
Sanhedrin's reaction, the desire for vengeance. But cooler heads
prevailed [33-39], so, the apostles were beaten and given the original
order again: do not preach in the name of Jesus again [40]. Showing
inner strength, the apostles rejoiced; they suffered for Christ, just
as Christ suffered for them [41], and they went out to preach anew.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>How
do we answer God's call? How do we witness to his action in our lives?
Do we accept the "judgment" society to keep religion a private matter,
or do we "proclaim the Good News from the roof tops?</i></p>
