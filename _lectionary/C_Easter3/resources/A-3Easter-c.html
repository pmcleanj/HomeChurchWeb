						<h4>The Catch, the Meal, and the Commitment</h4>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>What are you planning for vacation this summer?</i></p>
						<p class="bodytext">It's
almost vacation time! Time to indulge hobbies, time to share leisurely
meal, time to renew relationships. For some, half the fun is planning
the vacation. For others, half the fun is being with others on
vacation. No matter. It's a time to escape the mundane, high-pressured
existence to find a sense of self.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">After
the resurrection, Peter and his companions left the pressure of
Jerusalem for their quiet roots in Galilee. There, doing what they did
best, they encountered the Lord. In symbols that would paint the way
they evangelized.</p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Many times, Jesus proved that he had truly risen from the dead.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>1
After this, he showed himself again to his followers on Lake Tiberius
in the following way. 2 Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathaniel who was
from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other followers were
together one evening. 3 "I'm going fishing," Simon Peter told them.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>"We're going fishing with you," they replied.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>They
went out in the boat. But they didn't catch anything all night. 4 A
little after sunrise, Jesus stood along the shore. His followers,
however, did not recognize him. 5 <font color="#f00000">"Lads!"</font> Jesus called out, <font color="#f00000">"Did you catch anything to eat?</font>"</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>"No!" they answered back.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>6 <font color="#f00000">"Throw your net to your right!"</font> Jesus shouted again. <font color="#f00000">"That's where you'll find fish!"</font></b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>They
threw the net into the lake. But, because of the large catch, they
weren't strong enough the haul the net in. 7 Then, the follower who
loved Jesus said to Peter, "Look! It's the Lord!" When Peter heard
this, he tucked in his jacket and jumped in the water. 8 The others in
the boat rowed toward the shore, dragging in the net filled with fish.
They weren't far from land, only about a hundred yards.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>9 When they reached the shore, they saw a charcoal fire cooking fish and some bread next to the fire. 10 <font color="#f00000">"Bring me some of the small fish you just caught,"</font>
Jesus told his followers. 11 Peter went and dragged the net onto the
land. There were one hundred and fifty-three large fish in the catch!
12 Then, Jesus said, <font color="#f00000">"Join me for breakfast."</font> None of his followers was bold enough to ask "Who are you?" They already knew it was the Lord.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>13
Then, Jesus took the bread and shared it with his followers. He did the
same with the small fish. 14 This was the third time the risen Jesus
showed himself to his followers.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>15 After breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <font color="#f00000">"Simon, do you love me?"</font></b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>"Lord, you know I love you," Simon replied.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#f00000">"Feed my lambs,"</font> Jesus told him.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>16 <font color="#f00000">"Simon, do you love me?"</font> Jesus asked a second time.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>"Lord, you know I do," Simon replied.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#f00000">"Take care of my sheep,"</font> Jesus told him.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>17 "Simon, do you love me?" Jesus asked a third time.</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>Now,
Peter's feelings were really hurt because Jesus asked him three times,
"Do you love me?" "Lord, you know everything," Peter replied. "You know
I love you!"</b></p>
						<p class="maroontext"><b>18 <font color="#f00000">"Feed my sheep,"</font> Jesus told him.<font color="#f00000">
"Listen! When you were young, you got ready by yourself and went where
you pleased. But, when you get old, someone else will get you ready and
take you where you really don't want to go."</font> Jesus told Simon Peter this, signifying the way Peter would die and give God glory. 19 Then, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <font color="#f00000">"Follow me."</font></b></p>
						<p class="bodytext">In
this touching post-resurrectional narrative, the echoes of three gospel
scenes weave together: the great catch of fish in the call of Simon
Peter, the feed of the multitude with bread and fish, Peter's denial.</p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>1
After these (events), JESUS showed himself again to (HIS) disciples on
the Sea of Tiberius, He showed (himself ) in this way. 2 (They) were
together, Simon Peter, Thomas [called the 'Twin'], Nathaniel [the one
from Cana in Galilee], the (sons) of Zebedee, and two other of his
disciples. 3 Simon Peter said to them, "I am going (out) to fish." They
said to him, "We are also going (to fish) with you." They went, got
into the boat, and catch nothing during that night. 4 When it was
already dawn, JESUS stood on the shore. The disciples, however, had not
known that it was JESUS. 5 JESUS said to them, <font color="#f00000">"Young friends, do you not have something to eat?"</font> They answered HIM, "No!" 6 HE said to them, <font color="#f00000">"Throw the net over the right side of the boat. You will find (fish)."</font>
They threw (the net) in and were no longer strong (enough) to haul (it
in) because of the mass of fish. 7 Then, that disciple who loved JESUS
said to Peter, "It is the LORD!" Simon Peter, hearing it was the Lord,
tucked in his outer garment [for he was lightly clothed (as he fished)]
and threw himself into the sea. 8 The other disciples in the small boat
came (to the shore), for they were dragging the net of fish, not far
from land but just one hundred yards.</b></p>
						<p class="indent">21:4
Why didn't the disciples know it was Jesus? The appearance of Jesus
(and the recognition of his presence) belongs to divine initiative. It
is not in the power of people to recognize the presence and activity of
God. Such a recognition depends upon grace.</p>
						<p class="indent">21:5
"Young friends" is literally "Children" (as in "small boys"). To an
adult male, this might be considered a putdown. However, in John's
first letter, the neutral term "Children" (can be male or female) is
used 12 times as a term of endearment for Christians. While the
connection of the author of John's gospel with the author of 1 John
might be in dispute, the term was used in the early Christian
communities.</p>
						<p class="indent">21:7 "tucked in his outer
garment [for he was lightly clothed (as he fished)] " is literally
"belted his outer garment [for he was naked]." The text indicates Peter
fished naked, then threw a belt around an out garment before he jumped
into the water. The context, however, makes this interpretation
suspect. Peter, like his contemporaries, wore clothing in layers, more
in the cold evening, fewer in the hot day. Most likely, as Peter and
his companions fished throughout the cold night, he would have been
clothed with the maximum number of layers to retain heat. As the dawn
broke and the temperature rose, Peter took off his outer garment to
remain comfortable. (The term "naked" can also be translated "lightly
clothed" or "clothed in undergarments.") When Peter prepared to jump in
the water, he tied or tucked the outer garment in to keep it from
getting wet. The verse indicated Peter dressed to meet the Lord.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Unlike
the other resurrection stories found in the Gospels, this appearance
took place in Galilee, at the so-called "Sea of Galilee" (which
actually was a lake). In this story it is known as the "Sea of
Tiberias" named in honor of the Emperor [1]. There are seven disciples
in the story: Peter (the leader), the sons of Zebedee (James and John),
Nathaniel (an early disciple who Jesus chose in John 1:45-50), Thomas
(the doubter), and two others [2]. For Jews, the number seven
represented fullness, so there was a "fullness" of the community
present.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">According to good business
practice, Peter went fishing with the others at night. But they did not
catch anything [3]. Reminiscent of Jesus' call to Peter at the
beginning of his Galilean ministry, Jesus greeted the community at dawn
and ordered them to cast their nets over the side. Such a great number
of fish were caught, they had to be dragged to the shore [4-8].</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Like
much of John, these few sentences were packed with symbolism. The boat
was an old symbol for the church; fishing at night represented a
failing missionary effort. It must have felt like the night Jesus was
dead in the tomb. But with the dawn, the Risen Lord was present, and
with him came the great number of new Christians (represented by the
great number of fish). According to some early Christian writers, the
number of fish (153 in verse 11) represented all the known species in
the world at the time; these fish represented all the peoples of the
world, where the missionary effort should go (see Matt. 13:47-50). With
the great catch, the Lord was recognized.</p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>9
As they went onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire lying (there),
small fish cooking on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them,<font color="#f00000"> "Bring (some) out of the small fish you caught now."</font>
11 Simon Peter went up and hauled the net onto the land, full of large
fish, 153 (different ones). Being such (a large number), the net did
not split open. 12 JESUS said to them, <font color="#f00000">"Come, eat (breakfast with me)."</font>
Knowing it was the LORD, none of the disciples was bold enough to ask
him, "Who are YOU?" 13 JESUS came, took the bread, and gave it to them.
(HE did) likewise (with) the small fish. 14 This was already the third
(time) JESUS, having been raised from the dead, showed (himself) to his
disciples.</b></p>
						<p class="bodytext">Bringing the catch with
them, Peter and the disciples joined Jesus for breakfast of bread and
fish [9-13]. A breakfast meal with the Risen Lord should have been
Eucharist (bread and wine) but a meal of bread and fish was part of the
early Christian tradition. The multiplication of the loaves and the
fish (Matt. 14:15-21 &amp; 15:32-38, Mark 6:35-44 &amp; 8:1-8, Luke
9:12-17, and John 5:6-13), the appearance of the Risen Lord eating fish
as a proof of the resurrection (Luke 24:41-43) and early Christian art
in the catacombs (images of Jesus sharing bread and fish with his
followers) were powerful witnesses to this tradition.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">What
did the meal mean to the early Christian community? As you read above,
the fish represented new believers; the meal then represented the
initiation of Christians, as they were incorporated into Christ and the
community (represented by Christ and the community eating the fish).
The image was Eucharist in reverse; instead of the believer consuming
Christ in the Eucharist, the new believer is consumed by Christ. The
inclusion of new believers into the Body of Christ (i.e., the
community) brought new life (just as eating fish brought strength and
nourishment to the body). The image of the bread and fish pointed out
the close connection between Eucharist (bread) and baptism (fish).
Scholars speculate that the Church leadership had a meal of fish and
bread to celebrate the initiation of new Christians into the community.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Why
don't we celebrate this meal today? In the ancient society, fish could
be kept only for a limited time and traded only over a limited
distance. When the disciples left the area of Galilee (where fish was a
food staple) and moved into the Mediterranean world of the Roman
empire, the meal could only be celebrated in the coastal areas. As the
Church grew to inland areas, fish was not readily available. So the
tradition quickly died out.</p>
						<p class="bluetext"><b>15 When they had ate the meal, JESUS said to Simon Peter, <font color="#f00000">"Simon, (son) of John, do you love me more than these?"</font> He said to HIM, "Lord, you know I love you." HE said to him, "Graze my lambs." 16 HE said to him a second time, <font color="#f00000">"Simon, (son) of John, (do) you love me?"</font> He said to HIM, "Yes, Lord, you know I love you." HE said to him, "Shepherd my sheep." 17 HE said to him a third time, <font color="#f00000">"Simon, (son) of John, do you love me?"</font>
Peter was hurt because HE said to him for a third time, "Do you love
me?" He said to HIM, "Lord, you know everything. You know I love you."
JESUS said to him, <font color="#f00000">"Graze my sheep. 18 Amen,
Amen, I say to you. When you were young, you belted yourself and walked
around where you wanted. But, when you grow older, you will stretch out
your hands; another will belt you and will bring you where you do not
want (to be)."</font> 19 HE said this signifying in what kind of death he will glorify God. Saying this, HE said him, <font color="#f00000">"Follow me."</font></b></p>
						<p class="indent">21:15-17
John used different wording to drive home the same point. Jesus asked
for loving devotion ("agape" in 21:15-16) and companionship ("phileo"
in 21:17). Peter retorted, insisting Jesus knew of his commitment
("phileo" in all three verses). Jesus responded with "grazing" the
lambs in 21:15, "shepherding" the sheep in 21:16, and "grazing" the
sheep in 21:17. Because the images are so close and the language in
John is so loose, the words for love are synonymous, as well as the
activity of the shepherd.</p>
						<p class="indent">21:18 "you
belted yourself and walked around where you wanted" Belting one's outer
garment was the final step to prepare for the day's activities outside
the home. The phrase referred to self initiative and independent
mobility. It is a sly reference to 21:7 when Peter "belted himself" and
swam to see the Lord.</p>
						<p class="indent">21:18-19 Jesus used
a proverb to indicate the death of Peter. According to tradition, Peter
was martyred. Whether the description used in the proverb literally or
figuratively referred to the way Peter died (upside down on a cross in
the Caesar's circus yard in the Vatican) is a matter of dispute.
However, command to love and to follow Jesus that acted as bookends to
this proverb made it clear that Peter was to act as Jesus and follow
Jesus on the road that led to death (and to resurrection).</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The
balance of the reading redressed Peter's denial of Jesus before his
death. The Risen Lord asked Peter three times about his devotion; three
times Peter professed his love for the Lord; three times, Christ
instructed Peter to feed the followers [15-17]. Confirming Peter's
choice, Jesus used an old proverb as a prophecy for Peter's death; when
he was young, he was free, but now he has made his choice, he must live
with the consequences of that choice [18-19]. Like Peter, a Christian's
life of faith and service leads to death (to the world) and a new life
(in Christ and his community).</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>No
matter whether the believer is new or old, a pew sitter or a leader,
the call of Christ is the same: "Follow me." Following Christ means
evangelization and life in the community. Are we, like Peter, spreading
the net for new believers and professing a true love for our Savior? Or
are we on the sidelines watching others doing the work of the Church?</i></p>
						<p class="bodytext">As
you plan for your vacation this summer, remember the story of Peter and
his friends. The way they spent their time, the way they celebrated
their friendship (and devotion to the Lord), and the way they renewed
their friendship spoke volumes about the level of their discipleship.
Fishing, breakfast, and "discussions" may form a wonderful vacation.
With the Lord, they can form unforgettable experiences that change us
forever.</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><i>Begin to plan your vacation with prayer and plans to include the Lord on your journeys. </i></p>
