<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
legend of Abram&rsquo;s and Sarai&rsquo;s names being changed to
Abraham and Sarah has little meaning apart from God&rsquo;s covenant
promise that went with it.&nbsp; All subsequent history of the Jewish
people rests on this promise.&nbsp; They were to be God&rsquo;s
people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Today, two other religious traditions, Christianity and Islam,
also trace their origins to Abraham and Sarah. With Judaism, these
three form the majority of the world&rsquo;s total population of six
billion. Despite our many divisions and frequent conflicts, does this
not say something about God&rsquo;s sovereignty over the history of
our time and all time? Is this the meaning of the covenantal promise
in vss. 6-7? Is it not at least something we should ponder as we move
through the Lenten season? What on Earth is God doing? Why has God
made covenant with humanity &ndash; ordinary, sinful human beings
such as we are?</P>
<P>It should be noted that according to the documentary theory of the
Pentateuch this particular story was part of&nbsp; the so-called
Priestly document written by a school of priests which forms the
framework for the whole Book of Genesis.&nbsp; At least two earlier
documents, called J and E after the distinctive names Jahweh and
Elohim used in each,&nbsp; were fitted into this framework to create
the present text.&nbsp; This editorial work was done in the 5th
century BC, long after Israel&rsquo;s return from exile in Babylon
and more than a thousand years after the presumed time of Abraham&rsquo;s
migration to Canaan.</P>
<P>Much scholarly debate continues as to the historicity of Abraham.
The most extreme views banish him to the status of a fictitious hero
of the post-exilic or Persian period (539-330 BCE), or even later in
Hellenistic times of the late 4th century BCE. The intent of this
theological fiction was to create a new sense of self-identity among
the Jewish people thus bringing about harmony among the returning
exiles and the peasant classes who had not been transported to
Babylon. Strictly orthodox Jewish interpreters, on the other hand,
depend on vs. 8 as the charter for &ldquo;Eretz-Israel&rdquo; and the
ideological foundations of modern Zionism.</P>
<P>Many Christian scholars still hold to the more conservative
position that Abraham was at least the leader of a tribe which
migrated from the Upper Euphrates River valley (Haran) to Canaan
circa 1750 BCE. One scholar has identified at least twenty-two
separate episodes in the Abraham saga in Genesis 11:27 to 25:11. This
reading is but one of those episodes.&nbsp; (See L Hicks. The
Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible Dictionary. I.16)</P>
<P>Without question, second only to Moses, Abraham was the hero of NT
authors. Twice he is regarded as the father of the impious (Matt.
3:9; John 8:39), but more often as an inspiration to Jews to live up
to their spiritual heritage as people of faith (Luke 19:9; 16:24;
Heb. 6:13). In Galatians 3:7 Paul cited him as father of all
believers and so a source of unity and harmony. This attitude offers
hope for greater respect and dialogue rather than conflict and
dissent among Jews, Christians and Moslems today.</P>

God has helped his people (vv. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+22%3A4-5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4-5</A>):

his suffering is worse because they think that his illness is proof

I will offer thanksgiving in assembly of the community in the Temple:

so will my offspring: they will be God&rsquo;s for ever, and will
tell future generations about God&rsquo;s saving deeds.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
is a possibility that this part of the psalm is actually a separate
hymn of praise and thanksgiving unrelated to the lament of the first
part. It may also have served as a liturgy for anyone who came to
give thanks for deliverance from affliction.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The first few verses of this reading presents some insight into
the common practices surrounding a thank offering in the temple.
Rejoicing in deliverance from distress, the worshipper invites the
gathered congregation to join him in praise as he offers his
sacrifice. The invitation includes sharing in a feast, or at least
the eating of a portion of the sacrifice, possibly meat, sweet cakes
or fruit. It may only have been a token and symbolic meal such as we
share in the celebration of holy communion.</P>
<P>The psalmist, however, has a more universal understanding of what
happens. Not only is this act of worship and praise to Yahweh shared
by those in attendance at the time. It is for all people and for all
time because Yahweh is sovereign over all (vss. 27-28). And not only
the living, but the dead will join in the worship (vs. 29) and so
also shall the unborn (vss. 30-31).</P>
<P>The psalm as a whole reflects the lament for the terrible tragedy
of the Babylonian exile and the hopeful universalism of Second
Isaiah. Like the various NT descriptions of the Passion of Christ and
the theological insights of the Epistles, vss. 1-22 speak of
hate-filled hostility and horrible suffering. Yet vss. 23-31 bring
out the triumphant note of thanksgiving and praise for deliverance
from affliction efficacious for all people of faith. It is highly
probable that this psalm typified for the NT authors what Jesus has
done for us. Hence the quotations from vss. 7, 8 and 18 in the
Passion story in all four Gospels and the underlying motif of Paul&rsquo;s
Christology.</P>

Paul has argued that through the gospel, it is faith that brings
humans into harmony with God. Now he considers Abraham as an example.
At the time, rabbis argued that God&rsquo;s blessings came to Abraham
because he kept Mosaic Law (which, they said, he knew in advance &ndash;
before Moses received the tablets on Mount Sinai.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A13" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>,
Paul argues against this rabbinic lore: Abraham was blessed because
he believed, had faith, that he would be father of a nation and a
source of blessing for &ldquo;all ... families&rdquo; (Genesis <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+12%3A3" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">12:3</A>).
If only those who keep Mosaic Law are God's people, faith is
meaningless (&ldquo;null&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A14" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">14</A>)
and God's &ldquo;promise&rdquo; of universal godliness is nonsense &ndash;
because the Law is a contract; in a contract, each party has
responsibilities, each <EM>knows</EM> what he will receive (e.g.
&ldquo;wages&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A4" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>),
but a promise is a gift, and is therefore an <EM>object of faith</EM>:
faith that what is promised will be received. Paul now notes: because
we all deviate from God&rsquo;s ways at times, sinning does happen.
For those under the Law, a penalty (God&rsquo;s &ldquo;wrath&rdquo;,
v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A15" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">15</A>)
ensues, but for us, not living under the Law (&ldquo;no law&rdquo;),
there is no contract to violate. Paul now returns to his main
argument: so rather than the human relationship being legally based,
&ldquo;it depends on faith&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A16" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">16</A>),
on God&rsquo;s freely given gift of love (&ldquo;grace&rdquo;). Were
it legally based, continually breaking the pact would make a nonsense
of it, but being faith-based, the relationship is &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo;
to all peoples in every age - not just to Jews but also to others.
Per Genesis <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Genesis+17%3A5" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">17:5</A>,
Abraham is spiritual father of us all (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A17" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">17</A>).
Sarah&rsquo;s bearing of Isaac when beyond child-bearing age (&ldquo;gives
life to the dead&rdquo;) was due to his faith; it had been promised
to him by God. Isaac was <EM>called into existence</EM>. So Abraham
is a model for the Christian. Contrary to expectation, in hope
(&ldquo;Hoping against hope&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A18" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">18</A>)
he believed. He had every reason to doubt that he would become a
father, but believe he did &ndash; because of the hope given by God's
promise &ndash; in God's creative power. Abraham's faith grew
stronger as he thanked God for his gift (&ldquo;gave glory to God&rdquo;,
v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A20" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">20</A>).
He attained a right relationship with God (&ldquo;was reckoned to him

Our faith in God&rsquo;s promises will also be considered worthy by
God when Christ comes again (&ldquo;our justification&rdquo;, v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Romans+4%3A25" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">25</A>).</P>

had a difficult task in writing to the Roman Christian community.
They were unknown to him. He may have met some of them in his
travels, but by and large he did not know them personally. He did
know, however, that like so many other communities of faith he had
founded in Asia Minor and Greece, they were a mixed group of Jews and
Gentiles drawn from many different backgrounds with very little in
common. He also carried with him the weight of his own background. A
Jew of the Diaspora, he had a sensitivity toward Greek-speaking
Gentiles. As a thoroughly trained rabbi of the Pharisees, he knew the
Torah intimately as well.&nbsp; Then too, his mind and heart had been
profoundly transformed by his conversion to Christ and his many years

passage. Paul&rsquo;s argument here was that God&rsquo;s promise to
Abraham (our Old Testament lesson) had special meaning for the Roman
Christians.&nbsp; As for the patriarch, faith in God, not keeping the
law, made the promise effective for them. Faith works in the same way
for us. Our being given a right relationship with God (Paul calls it
&lsquo;justification&rsquo;) depends on our faith in what God has
done in the deaht and resurrection of&nbsp; Jesus Christ, and not on
any good behavior of our own.</P>
<P>Note how many times Paul used the word <EM>faith</EM> in this
passage - seven. <EM>Believe</EM> occurs three more times and <EM>promise</EM>
five times. Isn&rsquo;t faith an extremely fragile basis to depend on
for anything, let alone one&rsquo;s eternal justification, a
permanent relationship with the Creator of the universe? If one does
not have faith - trust is a better word, perhaps - in what God has
done for us in Jesus Christ, like Abraham, we are as good as dead.
Isn&rsquo;t that rather contemptuous of all we &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;
people have achieved in making life wholesome and worthwhile in the
past two or three hundred years?</P>
<P>A friend of mine once was asked, &ldquo;What happens to those who
died without believing?&rdquo; His blunt answer went right to the
point, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; Edward Fitzgerald put it
more poetically in his sardonic work The Rubaiyat of Omar Khaiyim :
&ldquo;Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, Before we too into
the Dust descend, Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie, Sans Wine,
sans Song, sans Singer, and - Sans End.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But is it all so simple? Believe or else? Canadian theologian,
Douglas John Hall, in his monograph, <EM>The Cross in Our Context</EM>
(Minneapolis, MN. Augsburg Fortress Press, 2003) put it differently.&nbsp;
After convincingly stating that God loves the world and all of
creation so much that he sent Jesus to redeem us from our alienation
from God, he points out that &ldquo;the cross reveals the
compassionate determination of God to bring the creation to the full
realization of its potentiality for authenticity&hellip;. By grace
you are being humanized, made human, made <EM>truly</EM> human&hellip;.
God wills that you be human: <EM>vere homo</EM> - <EM>truly </EM>human.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Paul&rsquo;s conviction was based on his own faith in what Christ
had done for him, even with many generations of the Hebrew tradition
behind him. Yes, this was a whole new interpretation of the Torah.
But this was for Paul precisely the meaning of the life, death and
resurrection of Jesus. He knew from painful personal experience how
deadly every attempt to achieve authentic righteousness acceptable to
a Holy God could be. He also knew that the Gentiles&rsquo; ignorance
of the Torah did not exclude them from the gracious love of God so
fully revealed in Jesus. Yet both could be come heirs of God&rsquo;s
promise to Abraham through faith in Jesus Christ (vss. 16-17).</P>
<P>This is the heart of the Lenten message for our generation. We no
longer put much stock in faith or in holy living, particularly in our
complacently prosperous part of the world. We proudly assert that we
have done so well in mastering our economic problems. And despite
current disruptions, we shall do so again. We change governments
without violent revolutions and political instability. We have become
so self-sufficient and so self-righteous about our success. Who needs
faith, God, salvation, holiness, or Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour?
These have become foreign words to our generation.</P>
<P>For Paul and for all people of faith that is not our true
inheritance. Despite all our remarkable achievements in recent
centuries, we have lost our sense of sin, our alienation from God,
and our need for redemption. We are dangerously close to being
spiritually dead. According to the Genesis story, Abraham was a
hundred years old when he received the promise that he would inherit
the world (vs. 13). A hundred years from now, we shall all be dead
and the world may not remember very much of what we have achieved.
Our vaunted prosperity may have passed to some other part of the
world in control of other people. Will Edward Fitzgerald&rsquo;s
rhyme then be our lot? How then can we justify our existence?</P>
<P>The point Paul makes in this passage is that we don&rsquo;t need
to justify ourselves. We need faith, like that of Abraham, like that
of Paul himself. Faith in God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead,
alone makes it worth living creatively, redemptively as Christian
disciples, in the world as it is right now.</P>
