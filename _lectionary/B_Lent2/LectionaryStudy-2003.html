<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">This is a &ldquo;Family
Lectionary Study&rdquo;. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Who knows what &ldquo;Family&rdquo;
is?</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">Jesus
said, &ldquo;Who is my mother? Who are my brothers? Those who do the
will of my Father in heaven are my Mother, my brothers, my sisters.&rdquo;
When we are baptized into God's family, we become brothers and
sisters of one another. Even if we don't know each others names; even
if one of us is a hundred-and-forty-two and another is three, we have
the same duty to God: to love Him and to serve one another. It would
be better, though, if we at least knew one-another's name! Sit down
in a circle with the people you came with, and let's go around the
circle. Introduce yourself and the people you came with, and tell us
how old you are.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Christians for two thousand
years have met together as Brothers and Sisters to study God's Word
together and pray together, just as we are doing. As brothers and
sisters, we are all equals: no one of us has authority over the
others, all though we all may have responsibilities to one another.
For example, I have taken the responsibility to prepare these
studies, but I'm not &ldquo;in charge. T<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>he
real &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; are the participants, from the youngest
to the oldest. Teaching is a big responsibility, so only people who
<I>want</I> to, should attend. </FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Who knows what a
&ldquo;Lectionary&rdquo; is? </B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">It's a rule, or pattern, for
reading something. The lectionary we use is called &ldquo;The Revised
Common Lectionary&rdquo;. About 30 years ago, many churches decided
that, because we are all part of Christ's one Body, we should all
study the Bible together. Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans,
Presbyterians and many others, all read the same parts of the Bible
on each Sunday. It takes us three years to read all the way through
the Bible. Each Sunday we have three readings: one passage from the
same Scriptures Jesus would have read, which we now call the Old
Testament, one from the letters that the early Christians, two
thousand years ago, sent to one another to encourage each other; and
one passage from the four collections of stories about Jesus, which
we now call the Gospels. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Who can name the four
Gospels?</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">During
the first year of the Lectionary -- &ldquo;Year A&rdquo;, we read
mostly from the Gospel of Matthew. On feast-days, like Christmas and
Easter, we read from the Gospel of John. During the second year of
the Lectionary, -- &ldquo;Year B&rdquo;, we read from the Gospel of
Mark &ndash; and also from John. During the third year -- &ldquo;Year
C&rdquo;, we read from the Gospel of Luke &ndash; and also from John.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">What was the sermon on? --
The sermon was about unequivocal commitment: God's covenant with the
world is unequivocal. Our response to God should be unequivocal. But
too often, we give only part of our commitment for God, and set up
&ldquo;false gods&rdquo; beside him in the form of social prestige,
passions, other interests.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened,
and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: and there came a
voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. And immediately the spirit driveth him into the
wilderness.<BR>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted
of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
unto him.<BR>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<BR>And saying,
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye,
and believe the gospel.</I>

Jesus is. Review our memory scripture:</P>

it with your dremel tool, coloured stains, paint and gilt. Provide

what is meant by &ldquo;picking up your cross'' &ndash; both
literally and figuratively.</P>

is like Home-work, except that it is done in the pews, instead of
being done at home. Because it is focussed on the readings (as the
sermon, presumably, also is) it can be done during the sermon to help
the listener concentrate. Or, it can be done while waiting for
everyone else to finish their communion. It isn't done during
prayers, or hymns, or the readings, because</FONT></P>
