<B>Jeremiah</B>
<P>
From Chapter 1, we know that Jeremiah was either born or began his ministry 
in 627 BC. During his life, Babylonia succeeded Assyria as the dominant 
power in the Middle East. He was a witness to the return to worship of the 
Lord (instituted by the Judean king Josiah), and then (after Josiah's death 
in battle in 609), the return of many of the people to paganism. When Babylon 
captured Jerusalem in 587, Jeremiah emigrated to Egypt. God called him to be 
a prophet to Judah and surrounding nations, in the midst of these political 
and religious convulsions.

their own sins&#8221;: collective sin, in which descendants were punished for wrongdoing, will be replaced by <EM>generational</EM> or personal sin: punishment will no longer extend beyond a lifetime. God promises to &#8220;make a new

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

written during, or shortly after, the Exile. The emphasis is on an <EM>individual&#8217;s</EM> sin, and prayers for personal pardon and restoration. The psalmist seeks cleansing from &#8220;iniquity&#8221; (vv.

<STRONG>Psalm 119:9-16</STRONG>
<P>This is the second stanza (of 22, one for each successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet) of the longest psalm. Each of the eight verses of this stanza begins with <EM>beth</EM>, the second letter. The whole psalm is in praise of the Law (the 
expression of God&#8217;s covenant with humankind in the Old Testament) and of keeping it. The emphasis is on the love and desire for the word of God in Israel&#8217;s law, rather than on <EM>legalism</EM>.</P>
<P>As in other stanzas, various words are used for law; here they are &#8220;word&#8221;, &#8220;commandments&#8221;,&#8220;statutes&#8221;, &#8220;ordinances&#8221;, &#8220;decrees&#8221;, and &#8220;precepts&#8221;. Cleansing (v.

<B>Hebrews</B>
<P>
Apart from the concluding verses (which may have been added later), this 
book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a letter. Its name comes from 
its approach to Christianity: it is couched is Judaic terms. The 
identity of the author is unknown; Origen, c. 200 said that "only God 
knows" who wrote Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, 
arguing for the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as 
revealer and mediator of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old 
Testament, the author argues for the superiority of Christ to the 
prophets, angels and Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his 
sacrifice is much more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus is 
the "heavenly" High Priest, making the true sacrifice for the sins of 
the people, but he is also of the same flesh and blood as those he makes 
holy.

<P>The author has spoken of the Jewish high priesthood; he has said that a (human) high priest was &#8220;put in charge of things pertaining to God&#8221; (v.

offer sacrifices for their sins. Since he himself from time to time offended God by sinning unintentionally, &#8220;he is able to deal gently&#8221; (v.

sins, and &#8220;must offer sacrifice for his own sins&#8221; (v.

become a high priest when called by God &#8211; &#8220;one does not presume to take this honour&#8221; (v.

<P>Now the author tells us how Jesus, whom he sees as a high priest, is like (and unlike) a Judaic high priest. Jesus too was called by God (v.

priest &#8220;forever&#8221; (v.

mentioned in Genesis 14:17-20; there he brings bread and wine, and blesses Abram. In Hebrews, he resembles the Son of God and lives for ever: he is a supernatural figure foreshadowing the eternity of the Son of God &#8211; see 7:2-3.) During 
Jesus&#8217; earthly life (&#8220;the days of his flesh&#8221;, v.

who could deliver him from death. But, although he was already God&#8217;s &#8220;Son&#8221; (v.

death. But the Father did hear his plea: he rose again from death. He was then &#8220;made perfect&#8221; (v.

his sacrifice for the sins of us all, and he was raised to be with the Father. In this way, he brings salvation to all who follow him. This salvation is forever (unlike the limited duration of that brought by Judaic high priests). He is high priest

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<P>At the time of the Passover (&#8220;the festival&#8221;), some Gentiles (&#8220;Greeks&#8221;) travel to Jerusalem, probably because they believe in God. Their request &#8220;to see Jesus&#8221; (v.
