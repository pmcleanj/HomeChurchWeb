it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be

writes: &ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2>The book of Job is about suffering: it
seeks to answer the question: why does God allow the faithful to
suffer? The first two chapters, which are in prose, tell of a
legendary figure of Judaism called Job. In this story (which may be
extremely ancient), a very righteous man is tested: is he as godly as
he seems, or is his godliness only an appearance, a result of his
acquisition of wealth and his position as father of a dynasty? His
continuing fidelity through deprivation of all that he possesses
demonstrates that he is truly godly. (In the final act of the drama,
God restores his greatness.) Most of the book is poetry, and appears
to have been written later. It is largely concerned with the meaning
of divine justice and suffering. Through dialogues with Job's
so-called &quot;friends&quot;, we see Job learn that wisdom is
God-given. Humans cannot find the way to it; God gives it to those
who worship him.</FONT> &rdquo;</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Job has complained of God&rsquo;s
indifference and injustice to him; he has asked why his misfortune
happened. He has pleaded that God hear him, answer him. Now God,
appearing in a &ldquo;whirlwind&rdquo; (as he does elsewhere in the
Old Testament) answers him by asking him rhetorical questions. First
he asks: <EM>who are you to doubt, in your ignorance, the sum total
of my plans and works? Stand up like a man; answer the questions I
put to you</EM> (vv. 2-3). Our reading is only a small part of God&rsquo;s
speech. He asks five main questions: </FONT>

</UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">In vv. 4-7, &ldquo;earth&rdquo; is pictured
as a building: who were the architect (v. 5a) and the surveyor (v.
5b)? Who laid the foundations (&ldquo;bases&rdquo;, v. 6a)? &ldquo;Who
laid its cornerstone?&rdquo; On this festive occasion, the &ldquo;stars
sang&rdquo; (v. 7) and God&rsquo;s heavenly court rejoiced. Now for
Question 4 (vv. 34-38): even if you gave the right orders, would they
be carried out? Only God has the &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;, the
combination of great knowledge and experience, to have the &ldquo;clouds&rdquo;,
etc. obey him. (People believed that a set of pudding bowls covered
the earth; here rain is stored in &ldquo;waterskins&rdquo;, v. 37. V.
38 describes the effects of rain.) Question 5 is in 38:39-39:30.
Eight creatures are described. Can Job care for them and nourish them
as the creator does? The last, the war horse, is the most amazing of
all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">After God&rsquo;s speech, Job says: &ldquo;See,
I am of small account; what shall I answer you? ... I will not
answer&rdquo; (40:4-5). God&rsquo;s appearance has invalidated the
very basis of Job&rsquo;s complaint. He is at last able to articulate
what he has been suspecting all along: he and his friends thought
they understood the world; now he realizes that they do not. And so
his complaint against God evaporates.</FONT></P>

writes: &ldquo;Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were
written over many centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's
temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are
of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal
psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;
there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the
end of each book.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">From word-Sunday</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">This psalm is a hymn of praise to God, the
creator. Vv. 2-4 tell of the creation of the heavens and vv. 5-9 of
the earth. To the ancients, &ldquo;light&rdquo; (v. 2) was a <EM>thing</EM>,
so likening it to a &ldquo;garment&rdquo; made sense. God built his
heavenly dwelling on the chaotic (unruly, disordered) &ldquo;waters&rdquo;
(vv. 2b-3a). The hot wind in v. 4 is the sirocco, a desert wind from
the east; the &ldquo;wind&rdquo; (v. 3c) brings rain clouds from the
sea; both are under God&rsquo;s control. People saw the earth as a
disk supported by pillars (&ldquo;foundations&rdquo;, v. 5). Before
God&rsquo;s creative acts, the &ldquo;waters&rdquo; (v. 6) covered
the earth. God chased away chaos, bringing order; he restricted the
waters to the mountain tops (as snow) and the &ldquo;valleys&rdquo;
(v. 8, as rivers). He will never again permit the waters to cover the
earth (v. 9) and all that lives (vv. 10-18): creatures depend on him
for their very existence (vv. 27-30). God&rsquo;s &ldquo;works&rdquo;
(v. 24) are countless. He has made them &ldquo;in wisdom&rdquo;, with
perfection of design and ethic, absolute integrity, truth and beauty.

section of Isaiah is part of the fourth Servant Song in what is known
as &ldquo;Second&rdquo; Isaiah. Most scholars believe that it was
written by the same person who wrote Isaiah 40-55. This song clearly
articulates the Messiah as the Suffering Servant. It expresses the
meaning of the death of Jesus.<BR><BR>The song begins at 52:13 so our
reading is the final portion. It is interesting to note the changes
in voice throughout the song. Our reading begins with an unidentified
group giving an account of the servant and their response and this
section ends with God as the speaker.<BR><BR>This powerful song lays
out the paradox of power and greatness for God. This relates directly
with the issue at hand in the Gospel text. Verses 10-12 could not be
more direct in stating, &ldquo;Therefore, I will allot him a portion
with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because
he poured out himself to death.&rdquo; Followers of the Suffering
Servant will be servant and also will suffer. This is the self
emptying love of the cup that Jesus drinks. No wonder so many people
have issues about using the common cup.</FONT></FONT> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">This passage takes place in the context of
Isaiah 53, one of the so-called &quot;Suffering Servant Songs.&quot;
Written at the end of Babylonian Exile, these &quot;songs&quot; speak
of God inflicting suffering upon his servant for the good of the
people. While interpreters have argued over the identity of the
servant, Christians have always pointed to the crucified Christ as
the One who suffers for the people. Indeed, Isaiah 53 is read on Good
Friday as the first reading.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Isaiah 53:10-11 speaks of the reason for
suffering [10] and the reward for the servant [11]. Notice both the
suffering and reward are community wide; the servant suffers for the
sin of the community and the benefits of the suffering are enjoyed by
the same community. Hence, the servant is a leader appointed by God
(to do his will in 53:10) but rejected by people (see 53:3).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Catholic speak of Jesus as priest, prophet,
and king. All three images converge in Isaiah 53. The rejected leader
(king) offers himself (priest) for the good of the community; his
action reveals God's will and actions (prophet).</FONT></P>

Chris Haslam at <A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?</A>
writes: &ldquo;Apart from the concluding verses (which may have been
added later), this book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a
letter. Its name comes from its approach to Christianity: it is
couched is Judaic terms. The identity of the author is unknown;
Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only God knows&quot; who wrote
Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, arguing for the
absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as revealer and mediator
of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old Testament, the author
argues for the superiority of Christ to the prophets, angels and
Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his sacrifice is much
more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus is the &quot;heavenly&quot;
High Priest, making the true sacrifice for the sins of the people,
but he is also of the same flesh and blood as those he makes holy.</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">The author has told us that &ldquo;we have a
great high priest&rdquo; (4:14) who has been raised to heaven, namely
&ldquo;Jesus, the Son of God&rdquo;. Now he compares the high priests
of Judaism with Christ.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">People chose a high priest to lead, on their
behalf, in matters relating to God, especially the offering of
sacrifices for sins. (The author writes as though the Temple
sacrificial system still exists.) A high priest was able to &ldquo;deal
gently&rdquo; (v. 2, to steer a right path between pure emotion and
lack of feeling) with those who committed unpremeditated sins because
he himself sinned in this way, being &ldquo;subject to weakness&rdquo;;
he needed to make sacrifice for his own sins too. He did not appoint
himself; rather, he was appointed by God, as Aaron was (v. 4).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Christ was also appointed by God &ndash; at
his baptism, when God said: &ldquo;You are my Son ...&rdquo; (v. 5).
Christ also fulfills Psalm 110:4 (v. 6): unlike other high priests,
he is &ldquo;priest forever&rdquo;. He ranks with &ldquo;Melchizedek&rdquo;,
the Canaanite priest who brought bread and wine to Abram, and blessed
him. (In 7:2, Melchizedek is said to resemble the Son of God.) During
his earthly life (&ldquo;the days of his flesh&rdquo;, v. 7), Jesus
prayed to God in anguish (at Gethsemane) to the one who would &ldquo;save
him from death&rdquo;, i.e. resurrect him (bring him back to life).
Because of his proper respect (&ldquo;reverent submission&rdquo;),
the Father heard him. Although already God&rsquo;s Son (v. 8), he
learned a needed human trait, obedience, through suffering. His work
of salvation complete (&ldquo;made perfect&rdquo;, v. 9), he, as
eternal priest, offers salvation forever to all the obedient, the
faithful. He is high priest forever.</FONT></P>

writes: &ldquo;As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death
became old and died, the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition
has it that Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered.
This book stresses the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to
understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels were
written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I>
mentioned in Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for
believers&rdquo;</FONT> </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Earlier
(in 9:33-34) the disciples have argued about which of them is the
greatest. Now two members of the inner circle ask a favour of Jesus:
they seek positions of special dignity at the messianic banquet in
heaven at the end of time (v. 37). Jesus answers: </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">you
do not know the implications of what you ask</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">.
In the Old Testament, one&rsquo;s &ldquo;cup&rdquo; (v. 38) is one&rsquo;s
lot assigned by God, be it blessing or condemnation. Here, Jesus is
speaking of his suffering and death. To be baptised with Jesus&rsquo;
baptism is to share fully in God&rsquo;s ways. James and John
confidently answer </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">yes</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
(v. 39) and accept all the consequences. Only the Father knows whom
he has called to special places in the kingdom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Jesus tells all the disciples: pagan
authority depends on power and force (v. 42) but for disciples, it is
different (v. 43): to be &ldquo;great&rdquo; now and in the kingdom
(&ldquo;become&rdquo;, v. 43 and &ldquo;be&rdquo;, v. 44) one must
serve others; to be &ldquo;first&rdquo;, one must serve even more
humbly, as a &ldquo;slave&rdquo;. Jesus, the &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo;
(v. 45), in his voluntary abasement, is the example: he gave even his
life for the freedom of others, gaining their release from punishment
and death for their sins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religion
is fertile soil in which the seeds of ambition subtly grow. Claiming
particular closeness to the power of God can have deadly dangers.
Some of history&rsquo;s most horrible deeds have been done by those
who claimed to be sitting on God&rsquo;s right or left hand. James
and John apparently felt their closeness to Jesus gave them special
access. They prefaced their request for prominence with &ldquo;Teacher,
we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.&rdquo; It is easy to
assume that relationship with God translates into entitlement.<BR><BR>Jesus
response to James and John challenges popular assumptions about
greatness, power, and prominence: &ldquo;Are you able to drink the
cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized
with?&rdquo; The other disciples were angry, perhaps afraid that
James and John would be given positions that they had sought. But
Jesus said to all the disciples, &ldquo;Whoever wishes to become
great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first
among you must be a slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be
served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The
cup from which Jesus drank is self emptying love, the giving of one&rsquo;s
own life for others. The baptism with which he was baptized is a
burial of the old world with its power games and the rising of God&rsquo;s
reign of justice, generosity and joy. This is downward mobility.<BR><BR>The
world&rsquo;s image of greatness is hierarchical, with the greatest
at the peak of the pyramid and God hovering over the top. The closer
one gets to the pinnacle, the closer one is to greatness and to the
image of God. Success, upward mobility and being served are signs of
faithfulness to this world&rsquo;s hierarchical god.<BR><BR>The way
of Jesus leads in another direction. Nouwen writes, &ldquo;the way of
the Christian is not the way of upward mobility in which the world
has invested so much, but the way of downward mobility ending on the
cross&hellip;It is not a leadership of power and control, but a
leadership of powerlessness and humility in which the suffering
servant of God, Jesus Christ, is made manifest.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT> </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">from word-sunday</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">A simple test of character is the question:
&quot;Why?&quot; Why does the candidate seek the power a political
position holds? Why does the actor seek fame in Hollywood or on
Broadway? Why does the business person seek wealth or the climb up
the corporate ladder? Why does the person of faith seek a position of
ministry?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">There is nothing intrinsically
wrong with ambition in any of these fields. In fact, most people use
ambition to better themselves and their surroundings. But the
question must be asked: why do they seek? Do they want to wealth and
fame and power for themselves alone? Or do they want to use these
ambitions for the greater good? These were the questions Jesus asked
his followers when the subject of ambition raised its head among the
Apostles.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Another note of interest was
Jesus' analogies. He compared his condition to table fellowship (the
cup) and initiation into the community (baptism). Both are
sacramental images that tie entry into and fellowship with the
community to Calvary. As James and John would soon learn, the
Christian way was the road to the cross.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">10:40 &quot;To sit on my right or
my left is not mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared.&quot;
Many have interpreted this phrase as supporting predestination. (the
view that God has foreordained those who would go to heaven). A
closer reading, however, discounts that view. Jesus simply stated
that glory in the Kingdom (i.e., the &quot;seating arrangements&quot;)
were God's prerogative. The disciple should not seek personal glory,
but God's will. God prepared a place for all who follow his call.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;my left&quot; The word
&quot;left&quot; in this case is actually &quot;well-named.&quot; In
the time of Jesus, people ate with the right hand; the left hand was
only used for personal hygiene purposes. &quot;Well-named&quot; was a
euphemism for &quot;left&quot; to avoid the negative meanings of the
left hand.How do people get ahead in life? Education and ingenuity
were not possible in Jesus' time; people believed that privilege
(like education) was foreordained and the ingenious were evil for
fighting against fate. Hence, honor and power were obtained through
challenge (like verbal debate) and mere request. Since the brothers
asked in front of the others, they were asking for a favor and
challenging the &quot;pecking order&quot; that the disciples had
established.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">The question was simple: sitting
at the places of honor when the Lord came in glory [37]. Glory here
meant reputation as well as power. The brothers wanted to share the
spreading fame of Jesus by osmoses. They wanted to be popular by
hanging onto the &quot;Big Guy.&quot; This was clearly a lazy man's
way to fame and fortune.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Commenting on their ignorance,
Jesus responded with a question about a drinking cup and baptism
[38]. The drinking cup was used at dinner to show unity with the
leader or host. The leader would drink from the cup then pass it to
the next one in line for honor (and so forth, down the line). The
passing of the drinking cup meant that the guests shared in the honor
and power of the host/leader. It was a share in the leader's &quot;glory&quot;
(i.e., reputation). Jesus' baptism led to his present reputation as a
charismatic preacher and healer. Who wouldn't say yes to the drinking
cup and baptism of a man with a growing reputation?! [39]</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Jesus affirmed their commitment
and their future [39] but insist he is God's instrument [40]. Jesus
implied that the glory of God is more important than his own; if he
had the power to give places of honor to the brothers, his own
ministry would be as selfish as their request. Not only does Jesus
not have the power to grant their request, he would not want it. It
was not Jesus' cup to pass or Jesus' baptism to give; it was the
Father's.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">10:42 &quot;the ones regarded as
rulers&quot; is literally &quot;the ones appearing to rule.&quot; The
true meaning of this phrase is uncertain. Possibly, Jesus meant God
of Israel was the true ruler of the world. The power of pagan rulers
was transitory and illusory.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">10:43-44 &quot;become great . . .
the first&quot; &quot;Great&quot; was a code word for having a large
public reputation. &quot;First&quot; was a code word for ruler.
Christian reputation and leadership depended on the service.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">10:45 &quot;to give his life (as
a) ransom in behalf of many.&quot; Ransom here did not mean money
paid, as in kidnaping. The word meant &quot;redemption&quot; or
&quot;release.&quot; Hence a better translation might be &quot;to
give his life to release many (sinners).&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">When the other apostles heard of
the brothers' request, they became angry [41]; this verse acts as a
bridge to Jesus' teaching on leadership based on love. Jesus rejected
a leadership of power [42] but pointed to a leadership of service. He
uses the image of the servant/waiter at a dinner to make his point.
At the banquet of God's kingdom, it was not the person who passed the
cup that was important; it was the one who took the order [43-44].
Referring to the &quot;Son of Man&quot; image [45], Jesus saw himself
on the cross as the primary model for &quot;servant leadership.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Think of waiters or waitresses in
our own culture. A good waiter or waitress must be part entertainer
(making good &quot;small talk&quot;) when the order is placed, timely
provider of food and drink, and invisible guide, ever to provide
assistance, yet at a discrete distance. They are to leave us alone
when we desire privacy, but approach immediately when we need help.
They are to serve us and, in doing so, they lead us through the meal.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Catechism Theme: The Communion in
Spiritual Goods (CCC 949-953)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">God calls all in the Church to
serve each other. For the Church shares its spiritual goods with its
members. We, the Church, are one in faith, one in sacraments and
worship, one in shared charisms, one in solidarity and charity. Our
faith, our worship, the diversity of our spiritual gifts and talents,
and the love we share all support one end, unity with Christ.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Communion of Saints embodies
the notion that all who are in Christ serve one another in love. True
Christian leaders bring the sacred communion to life. For their
ambition is not to glorify themselves but to evangelize. True
Christian leaders bring others to Christ. Questions of fame, power,
or gold are, at best, secondary.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><I>How have others shown you
Christian charity? How have they shown you and others their
leadership qualities?</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Jesus fits the waiter/servant
role perfectly. He leads by serving us; even though he seems distant,
he is ever present to help. As Christians, we are to lead others in
the same way, with tact and quiet guidance, by moral example and
moral commitment. Such leadership leads to the cross. But it also
leads to resurrection.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I><FONT COLOR="#800000">In what areas have you shown
service in the past two weeks? How do you plan to serve others this
week? What do your experiences and plans reveal about your

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
