longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for late Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Grace
be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Behold,
he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
of him. Even so, Amen.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2>Regarding the Book of Job, Chris Haslam at
<A HREF="http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?">http://www.montreal.anglican.org/comment/index.shtml?</A>
writes: &ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2>The book of Job is about suffering: it
seeks to answer the question: why does God allow the faithful to
suffer? The first two chapters, which are in prose, tell of a
legendary figure of Judaism called Job. In this story (which may be
extremely ancient), a very righteous man is tested: is he as godly as
he seems, or is his godliness only an appearance, a result of his
acquisition of wealth and his position as father of a dynasty? His
continuing fidelity through deprivation of all that he possesses
demonstrates that he is truly godly. (In the final act of the drama,
God restores his greatness.) Most of the book is poetry, and appears
to have been written later. It is largely concerned with the meaning
of divine justice and suffering. Through dialogues with Job's
so-called &quot;friends&quot;, we see Job learn that wisdom is
God-given. Humans cannot find the way to it; God gives it to those
who worship him.</FONT>&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Now Job answers: he
acknowledges God&rsquo;s &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; (v. 2). God has taught
him a lesson. Job acknowledges God&rsquo;s sovereignty. In vv. 3a &amp;
4, he quotes God&rsquo;s words spoken earlier. He admits his
ignorance (v. 3b). He has long had faith in God; this has now been
replaced by </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">seeing</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">
(and experiencing) God. (V. 6 is incomplete in the Hebrew. Because v.
7 implies that Job is godly, &ldquo;repent&rdquo; here is not
repentance of sins, it may mean </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">approach
you in awe</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#800000">.) It is sufficient that
God has come to him; he seeks no explanation of his suffering. In a
turnabout, God is angry with Eliphaz and the other friends for their
ungodliness (v. 7); he orders them to ask Job to intercede on their
behalf (v. 8); God accepts Job&rsquo;s prayer for them (v. 9). The
ancient story begun in 1:1-2:13 now continues. All Job has lost is
restored to him, some in double measure. He is no longer shunned by
his relatives (v. 11). Whether his health is restored is not
mentioned. To ancient people, possessions and progeny indicated God&rsquo;s
favour: God loves him even more dearly. Gifts are God&rsquo;s to
give. Their absence or withdrawal is hard for a virtuous person to
accept. </FONT></FONT>

writes: &ldquo;Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were
written over many centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's
temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are
of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal
psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are five &quot;books&quot;;
there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the
end of each book. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The
psalmist blesses God continually for what he has done for him: God
heard him, and restored him to a peaceful life (vv. 4, 6). May he be
an example for the &ldquo;humble&rdquo; (v. 2, the dedicated,
committed believers in God, who hence have a claim on God&rsquo;s
help). God protects (&ldquo;the angel of the LORD ...&rdquo;, v. 7)
those who hold him in proper respect (&ldquo;fear&rdquo;) and saves
them. Come to understand (&ldquo;taste and see&rdquo;, v. 8) that God
is ultimate goodness! (v. 8) The godly are his &ldquo;holy ones&rdquo;
(v. 9), those set part for him; they lack nothing (v. 10). Doing
good, abstaining from evil deeds, seeking and working for peace is
God&rsquo;s way (v. 14). It leads to a rich, long life. God always
hears the pleas of the godly when they are in need physically and
spiritually (vv. 17-18); when they suffer, he &ldquo;rescues them&rdquo;
(v. 19). Though they will suffer, they will be restored to health (v.
20). But he is &ldquo;against evildoers&rdquo; (v. 16), causing them
to be forgotten when they die. At the Last Day, the ungodly (who hate
the godly) will be damned but God will liberate those who trust in
him. </FONT></FONT>

writes: &ldquo;Apart from the concluding verses (which may have been
added later), this book is a treatise (or sermon) rather than a
letter. Its name comes from its approach to Christianity: it is
couched is Judaic terms. The identity of the author is unknown;
Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only God knows&quot; who wrote
Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, arguing for the
absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as revealer and mediator
of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old Testament, the author
argues for the superiority of Christ to the prophets, angels and
Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his sacrifice is much
more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus is the &quot;heavenly&quot;
High Priest, making the true sacrifice for the sins of the people,
but he is also of the same flesh and blood as those he makes holy. <FONT COLOR="#000000">&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The
author has written: &ldquo;we have a great high priest&rdquo; (4:14).
He asks: &ldquo;If perfection [the completion of God&rsquo;s plan of
salvation] had been attainable through the ... [Temple] priesthood&rdquo;
(v. 11) why would there be need to speak of another priest? The
levitical priests were under Mosaic law, but &ldquo;there is ... the
introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.&rdquo;
(v. 19), Jesus, the high priest, unlike others, &ldquo;became a
priest with an [divine] oath&rdquo; (v. 21). Psalm 110:4, the author
asserts, is about Christ: &ldquo;The Lord has sworn ... &lsquo;You
are a priest for ever&rsquo;&rdquo;, so &ldquo;Jesus has also become
the guarantee of a better [new] covenant.&rdquo; (v. 22).</FONT></FONT></P>

individual high priests died) and Jesus as the eternal ideal (&ldquo;he
continues forever&rdquo;, v. 24). So &ldquo;for all time&rdquo; (v.
25) Jesus is the way to God and to salvation for those who are godly
because he (as priest) lives to plead with God on their behalf
(&ldquo;intercession&rdquo;). Under Mosaic law, priests subject to
&ldquo;weakness&rdquo; (v. 28, sin) were appointed without divine
oath, but &ldquo;a Son&rdquo; has been appointed, by God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;oath&rdquo;, superceding the Law, a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;
(ideal) priest forever. Vv. 26-27 list Christ&rsquo;s qualities. He
has no need to sacrifice continually for his own sins and those of
others (as, the author asserts, earthly high priests did) for he is
&ldquo;separated from sinners, and exalted&rdquo; (v. 26), i.e. with
the Father; in dying, he offered sacrifice &ldquo;once for all&rdquo;
(v. 27) for our sins.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The author of the Hebrews used
the job description of High Priest to heighten the role Christ played
in salvation. In 5:1-4, the author painted the role of High Priest:
1) as mediator between God and people, 2) in a pastoral sense to deal
with the ignorant and the morally wavering, 3) as a worship leader
among (not above) the people, and 4) as one called by God. This is an
good description of the role of an understanding and prayerful man of
God. But the difference between the role of a good High Priest and
Christ was one of human weakness. A good High Priest was painfully
aware of his own sinfulness. And his own need for forgiveness, just
like the people. While Christ did not sin, he did empathize with
people because he was tempted. So, in this sense he could be the
perfect High Priest, since he fulfilled every function, including his
assumed weakness. Christ may have been the Son of God and Eternal
High Priest, but he was still one of us in every single way, but one.

writes: &ldquo;As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death
became old and died, the need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition
has it that Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what Peter remembered.
This book stresses the crucifixion and resurrection as keys to
understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels were
written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I>
mentioned in Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for
believers&rdquo;</FONT> </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus
and his disciples are now nearing the end of their journey from
Caesarea Philippi (in the north) to Jerusalem: &ldquo;Jericho&rdquo;
is some 25 km (15 miles) from Jerusalem. We have seen the disciples&rsquo;
misunderstanding and blindness to Jesus&rsquo; message. Mark has told
us of the healing of an unnamed blind man (8:22-26), one who is
healed gradually.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Here Mark gives tells us the
name of this &ldquo;blind beggar&rdquo;. Bartimaeus makes a
politically charged statement: Jesus is &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;
(v. 47), King of the Jews, and Messiah. Elsewhere, Jesus orders
silence on the matter, but not here: his time is approaching. For the
first time, a sane person immediately proclaims Jesus&rsquo; true
identity. The &ldquo;cloak&rdquo; (v. 50, garment) Bartimaeus throws
off is probably the cloth he uses to receive handouts; in Mark,

the one he asked James and John when they sought status in the
kingdom (10:36), but Bartimaeus&rsquo; approach is different: he
comes in humility (&ldquo;My teacher&rdquo;, v. 51). Jesus simply
tells him that his &ldquo;faith&rdquo;, (v. 52, his receptivity of
God&rsquo;s healing word, &ldquo;has made you well&rdquo; (also
meaning </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#800000">has

One who could help him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Blindness can be
more than physical. In today's gospel, a blind person sought Jesus
out for a cure, because the man could &quot;see&quot; in Jesus what

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>When he heard that
Jesus was approaching, the blind beggar called out to set Jesus up
for a cure [47-48]. The title &quot;Son of David&quot; could have
referred to Jesus' great ancestor; it could also have referred to
Solomon, the wisest man in Jewish history. According to the popular
image of the Galilean preacher, Jesus possessed God's wisdom with his
teaching, for he had God's power with his healing. So, he had the
spirit of Solomon. In either case, however, the blind beggar used the
title of honor as bait. Unlike the Pharisees and scribes, the beggar
did not seek to discredit Jesus in order to build up his own honor.
The beggar simply wanted to have his sight and his place in society
returned to him. Unlike the Pharisees' challenges, fulfilling the
blind man's challenge would increase the honor of both men.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>In the time of
Jesus, the phrase&quot;have mercy&quot; meant to pay debts; when the
debtor paid his or her creditor, he or she was &quot;having mercy&quot;
on the creditor. Through God's eyes, the healthy and the well-off
have a social debt to pay to the sick and the poor. In his cry for
mercy, the blind man was really challenging Jesus: &quot;Hey, wise
man, pay your social debt and cure me!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>No wonder Jesus'
disciples wanted to shut him up. What an embarrassment! But that did
not stop the tenacious man [48]. When Jesus recognized his plea (and
challenge), the social embarrassment became encouragement [49-50].
Jesus asked and responded to the man's request for sight [51].</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Unlike last week's
gospel, where James and John requested leadership, this week the
blind man requested sight. Unlike the physical, spiritual &quot;sight&quot;
is the ability to see the greater picture, to see events through
God's eyes. Lacking physical sight, Bartimaeus already had this
spiritual gift; Jesus' disciples did not. That is why Jesus could say
to Bartimaeus: &quot;Your faith has saved you.&quot; Jesus equated
spiritual sight with faith.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus also tells the
cured man: &quot;Go your way.&quot; But at the point Bartimaeus
called upon Jesus, he became a follower along the way of Jesus
(whether he knew it or not). That is why Bartimaeus did not go home,
but followed Jesus on his Way (another buzz phrase for
&quot;Christianity&quot;).</FONT></FONT></P>

The Characteristics of Faith (CCC 153-158)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Bartimaeus could see
with his spirit that Jesus could cure his eyes. The ability to see
beyond the present is wisdom. To see beyond the possible is faith, a
grace from God. The Spirit of God empowers us with spiritual
intuition and insight. We cannot arrive at faith by ourselves.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Yet, God never
forces faith upon us. Faith is a truly human action, for it requires
human choice. God offers us his gift. We are free to choose it or
reject it. When we choose faith, we actual choose cooperation. We
become partners with the divine in our salvation and the salvation of
the world.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>While faith exceeds
understanding, it does not conflict with human reason. In fact, human
reason can lead to (but never replace) faith. If reason and faith
appear to be at odds with each other, reason requires patience. Human
knowledge is never complete, as old insights give way to new ones and
as new areas of knowledge bring new questions. Understanding takes
time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Human understanding
can deepen and expand faith. We know that we believe. We want to know
why. Faith and understanding work hand in hand to bring us closer to
our Maker. But, faith needs to push the envelope of knowledge. For
knowledge tells us what is possible. Faith tells us what is
impossible. It is a vision of the impossible that brings us to God.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><I>How has God
helped you see the impossible? How has God helped you do the
impossible?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Bartimaeus gave us
an interesting example of conversion. Bold and persistent, the blind
man could see the possibility Jesus offered, and risked social
alienation for the result. But the result was far deeper that mere
physical sight. Jesus offers us the same. At the risk of social
standing, we, too, challenged to boldly ask and boldly receive change
in our lives.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
