<H3><FONT SIZE=4><I><B><A HREF="http://divinity.library.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/BEaster/beaster6.htm#acts">Acts
10:44-48</A>, </B></I></FONT>
</H3>
<P>This story reads like the story of Pentecost in Acts 2 and was
intended as its sequel. Before Peter had finished preaching, the Holy
Spirit came upon the household of Cornelius, a Roman military officer
and a Gentile. Jewish Christians accompanying Peter were astonished
that the Spirit had come to a gathering of Gentiles. With the baptism
of Cornelius and his household a new phase of the church&rsquo;s
mission began in earnest.</P>
<P> The idea of sequel stories is not new to modern television,
movies or mass market publishing. This story reads as the sequel to
the story of Pentecost in Acts 2. It repeats many of the same details
of the coming of the Holy Spirit to a Gentile community in the same
way the Spirit came to the Jerusalem fellowship. Before Peter had
finished preaching in the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit came
upon the household of Cornelius, a Roman military officer and a
devout Gentile (10:1). It might serve well to read the whole story as
the main lesson during worship. If it is not read but used for as the
sermon text, the preacher should tell the story briefly from the
beginning.</P>
<P>Caesarea was a major city on the Mediterranean and the main
headquarters for Roman governance of Palestine. The ruins of its
great amphitheatre, with an arena larger than the Colosseum in Rome,
its fortress and aqueduct are marvels of Roman engineering now
clearly visible after having been dug from the beneath sands that hid
them for many centuries. The breakwater that protected the
artificially constructed harbour can also be seen extending hundreds
of feet from shore. Its cosmopolitan population included many Jews as
well as Roman officials.</P>
<P>In its earlier stages this narrative points out how Peter learned
in a dream that the gospel was for Gentiles as much as for Jews.
Dreams were a typical means biblical authors used to describe a
theophany in which God&rsquo;s will was revealed. This passage in
Acts differs from what Paul said about Peter&rsquo;s struggle with
the expansion of the Christian mission. In Galatians 2:11-14, Paul
told how he had challenged Peter at Antioch on this same issue.
Either Peter was a slow learner or the event in Caesarea told in this
passage is a softer, kindlier version of the tradition about the
apostolic church having its vision enlarged.</P>
<P>The late Heinz Guenther, former professor of NT at Emmanuel
College, Toronto, believed that Acts presented a post-apostolic age
tradition with parallel versions of the successful work of the Spirit
through the two primary apostles, Peter and Paul, who in some
respects competed with each other in the Gentile mission. At the
Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), both of them appeared to be equally
effective in convincing James and the Jerusalem fellowship to move in
a new direction. Thereafter, Peter disappeared from the narrative,
but Paul&rsquo;s activities as an apostle were given full treatment
in the remaining chapters of The Acts of the Apostles.</P>
<P>Note that in this instance, some Jewish Christians were present.
They had accompanied Peter from Joppa to Caesarea. As Jews they
undoubtedly had the usual prejudiced attitudes toward Gentiles and so
were astonished to witness the gift of the Spirit to this assembly.
Most unexpected, perhaps, was the evidence of glossalalia, which
tends to confirm the hypothesis that this event was the Gentile
Pentecost. Baptism followed the coming of the Spirit, not vice versa.</P>
<P>The primary emphasis of Peter&rsquo;s message was not repentance,
but the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, who &ldquo;went about
doing good&rdquo; (vs. 38). Peter had spoken of repentance only in
the context of John the Baptist and concluded his message with
prophetic testimony of the forgiveness God grants to those who
believe (vs.43). Cornelius had already told Peter of his theophany in
which God approved of his alms (vs.31). Was the <EM>kerygma</EM>
being re-shaped for a Gentile audience to whom emphasis on sin,
guilt, repentance and forgiveness might have been relatively
meaningless? Further, in Peter&rsquo;s his sermon, Jesus is not
declared the Jewish Messiah, but &ldquo;the one ordained by God as
judge of the living and the dead&rdquo; (vs. 42). Such a designation
would certainly be more meaningful to a Roman military officer whose
role included that of a judge in many respects.</P>

John Shearman's Lectionary</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><A HREF="http://divinity.library.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/BEaster/beaster6.htm#psalm"><FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Psalm
98</B></I></FONT></A></STRONG></P>
<P>This triumphant hymn may well have been used in the temple ritual
for the Jewish New Year when Israel celebrated the enthronement of
God as sovereign of the world. Not only God&rsquo;s special people,
Israel, but the whole world and all of nature are summoned to join in
the praise.</P>
<P>This triumphant hymn may well have been used in the temple ritual
for the Jewish New Year when Israel celebrated the enthronement of
God as sovereign of the world. Scholars thus regard it, together with
Pss. 47, 93, 96, 97 and 99, as a group designated as &ldquo;Psalms of
Enthronement.&rdquo; All of them envision Yahweh seated on a heavenly
throne exercising dominion over all of creation.</P>
<P>The imagery may have derived from a similar Babylonian religious
tradition which enthroned their god Marduk at the beginning of each
year. The idea of Yahweh&rsquo;s kingship was a common theme among OT
authors. Israel&rsquo;s monarch ruled as Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed
representative. In post-exilic times, after the monarchy had
disappeared and Israel suffered subjection to foreign domination, the
concept of Yahweh as sovereign filled a deep spiritual need. It
provided Israel with a distinctive national identity enabling them to
survive as a people despite their political subjugation.</P>
<P>The prophetic influence of Second Isaiah can be seen in this
psalm. It has even been suggested that the psalm originated in
Babylon inspired by the coming of Cyrus, the Mede, to overthrow the
Babylonian dynasty. Faith interpreted this as a divine victory (vss.
1b-2) and an expression of Yahweh&rsquo;s love and faithfulness to
Israel (vs. 3).</P>
<P>The psalmist summoned not only Yahweh&rsquo;s special people,
Israel, but the whole earth and all of nature to join in the praise
of divine sovereignty. As in all cultures, music from both stringed
and brass instruments had a prominent place in the celebration (vss.
5-6). One wonders if the phrase &ldquo;a joyful noise&rdquo; referred
to a cacophony rather than melodious sounds. References to sounds of
nature - the roaring of waves on the seashore or sudden floods in dry
wadis; and the moan of wind whistling through the hills - vividly
reflect the psalmist&rsquo;s powers of observation and imagination
that these too sing their praise to Yahweh.</P>
<P>No believer in purely natural religion, the psalmist is also aware
of the role the sovereign played in rendering justice. To him Yahweh
is the just judge whose decisions are equitable for all people (vs.
9)</P>

<P><STRONG><A HREF="http://divinity.library.vanderbilt.edu/lectionary/BEaster/beaster6.htm#1john"><FONT SIZE=4><I><B>1
John 5:1-6</B></I></FONT></A></STRONG></P>
<P>In the controversy with heretical teaching that forms the
background of this letter, actions as well as words were essential.
Believing in Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God meant obeying God&rsquo;s
commands. &ldquo;The world&rdquo; represented all that was evil and
tempting to those early Christians. Living love for God and neighbor
was the way to live in the world without being dominated by its
sinful ways. This is still so.</P>
<P> The division of this letter into chapters and verses causes some
difficulty at this point. Paragraphing as in newer English versions
sufficiently carries forward the argument of the previous passages.
As did Jesus in his teaching and actions, John carefully balances
love for God and love for one&rsquo;s brothers and sisters as equally
important for the Christian. In the controversy with heretical
teaching which formed the background of this letter, actions rather
than words measured beliefs. Believing in Jesus as the Messiah and
Son of God meant obeying God&rsquo;s commandments.</P>
<P>It would appear from vs.1 that the heretics had separated Jesus of
Nazareth from Christ, the Son of God. The fundamental apostolic creed
was that Jesus was the Messiah/Christ and Son of the living God. This
Christological claim was the <EM>sine quae non</EM> of apostolic
teaching. However, membership in the Christian community involved
more than just a verbal declaration and a profession of love for God.
It also required strict adherence to God&rsquo;s commandments. That
seems to have been the point at which the heretical people had
failed. Their difficulty with the Christian way was ethical as well
as theological.</P>
<P>One can assume from vss. 3b-4 that obedience to the commandments
had become burdensome to some members of the fellowship. It was ever
thus in the church. The cultural milieu always seems more attractive
and acceptable than &ldquo;the narrow way&rdquo; of the Christian
life. &ldquo;The world&rdquo; represented all that was evil and
tempting to those early Christians, as it does to us. Living love for
God and neighbor was - and still is - the way to live in the world
without being dominated by its sinful ways. Then and now, many
questioned John&rsquo;s assertion that God&rsquo;s commandments
were/are not burdensome.</P>
<P>John put this moral challenge in terms of a conflict in which
faith that Jesus is the Son of God enables the believer to emerge
victorious (vs. 4b-5). He thus set before his audience the means for
living effective Christian lives in an unfriendly world. He did not
use the word, but he certainly had in mind what is meant by the
confession that Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the religious and ethical
authority who guides and governs Christian behaviour.</P>
<P>Humanity has devised innumerable means of dealing with the
inevitably difficult circumstances of life - flight from the world,
persuasion that evil does not exist and so cannot harm us,
anesthetizing ourselves with various kinds of addiction, distracting
ourselves with pleasure or cynically striking mephistophelean
bargains for limited ends. All ultimately fail except the one that
provides both meaning and purpose for every one with the faith and
courage to follow in the footsteps of the Son of God.</P>

<P>As in several other places in John&rsquo;s Gospel, chapters 13 to
17 use a familiar literary device of the time, an extended and
stylized discourse. Containing much of John&rsquo;s own thought about
the relationship of Jesus to the church, this discourse includes some
of Jesus&rsquo; most incisive teachings remembered by the church 60
or more years after the resurrection. As if quoting Jesus, John takes
us to the heart of the Christian discipleship: Love for others as God
has loved us. John thus interprets the meaning of Jesus&rsquo; death
on the cross as his loving sacrifice of himself for us.</P>
<P>As in several other places in John&rsquo;s Gospel, chapters 14 to
16 use a familiar literary device of the time, an extended and
stylized discourse. The style is characteristic of John&rsquo;s
Gospel. These discourses were attributed to Jesus and through the
centuries have been given literal authority. More probable, however,
they contain profound theological affirmations of who Jesus is and
what he means to the Christian fellowship and to the world. This is
particularly true of the several places where John quotes Jesus as
saying &ldquo;I am &hellip;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Containing much of John&rsquo;s own thought about the relationship
of Jesus to the church, this discourse may well include some of
Jesus&rsquo; most incisive teachings remembered by the church 60 or
more years after the resurrection. The dominant issue for the church
had changed from awaiting the imminent return of Christ to living in
a world that showed no signs of readiness to believe or to follow the
Christian way. The theme of this brief excerpt concentrates on
self-sacrificing love (<EM>agap&eacute;</EM>) as the unique focus and
life force of every Christian. Behind this passage stands the intense
shadow of the cross and the sovereign power of God to raise Jesus
from the dead and give the Holy Spirit to all who believe.</P>
<P>So John takes us to the heart of the Christian discipleship: Love
for others as God has loved us. He interprets the meaning of Jesus&rsquo;
death on the cross as his loving sacrifice of himself for us in
obedience to God&rsquo;s loving will and purpose, not only for
himself but for the whole world.</P>
<P>We cannot begin to imagine how disturbing the cross must have been
to those early Christians immersed and they were in Roman
civilization and frequently facing Roman justice. As a means of
execution, crucifixion was the ultimate in cruelty, indignity and
violence. Despite all that, the apostolic church transformed it into
the only credible symbol of living creatively in a world for which
death on a cross was the ultimate punishment for criminal behaviour.</P>
<P>Could this really be understood as the ultimate joy for Jesus and
for those who had committed themselves to follow him (vs. 11)? Yet
this is a repeated affirmation of other NT writers (Heb. 12:2; Gal.
5:22; Rom. 14:17; 15:13).</P>
<P>Furthermore, as John has phrased this tradition, there can be no
greater love for one&rsquo;s friends than to follow in Jesus&rsquo;
footsteps even to the point of death (vs. 13). The emphasis on
friendship has considerable significance. The Christian way of life
exists only in effective human relationships. Every human institution
- the church included - works best when relationships are firmly
based on mutual respect and humane values, at the root of which is
love. As we move toward a global civilization no other value system
will prove sufficient. The selfless relationships of <EM>agap&eacute;</EM>
love have been proven in the crucible of the divine-human experiment
which is Jesus Christ. This is what Jesus is saying throughout this
passage. This is the fruit that Jesus prophesied his friendship with
these few disciples would yield (vs. 16). It began with his love for
them and their love for each other. We who believe are called to make
a similar witness in our time and place.</P>
