<B>Acts</B>
<P>
This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<STRONG>Acts 10:44-48</STRONG>
<P>Peter has been bidden to visit Cornelius, an officer of the Roman army of occupation stationed in Caesarea. Both have had visions; in Peter&#8217;s case, he has been advised not to worry about what meat a Jew can eat per Mosaic law (and whether 
he can visit a Gentile home.) Peter visits Cornelius and his household: &#8220;many had assembled&#8221; (v.

shown him not to distinguish between Jews and non-Jews (v.

reveres and prays to God, tells him of his vision, of God&#8217;s agent who told him to send for Peter. Cornelius says: &#8220;So now all of us are here in the presence of God to listen to all that the Lord has commanded you to say&#8221; (v.

<P>Peter summarizes Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry. In Jesus&#8217; baptism, the Father anointed [him] ... with the Holy Spirit and with power&#8221; (v.

&#8220;all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem&#8221; (v.

God. Jesus commanded them to spread the good news, and to testify that he, as God&#8217;s agent, is to judge (at the end of the era) those still living and those who have died (v.

Testament prophets spoke: &#8220;everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins&#8221; (v.

<P>Now, the Holy Spirit comes, as a &#8220;gift&#8221; (v.

the Gentiles&#8221;: to the surprise of the Jewish Christians &#8220;who had come with Peter&#8221;. (&#8220;Speaking in tongues&#8221;, v.

Spirit.) The pouring out of the Spirit and baptism are closely associated in Acts; here baptism follows the coming of the Spirit. Peter&#8217;s question (v.

received it, so surely they can be baptised. So they are baptised &#8211; not by Peter, but under his authority (v.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<STRONG>Psalm 98</STRONG>
<P>Worshippers are invited to sing &#8220;a <U>new</U> song&#8221; marking new evidence of God&#8217;s rule. With truth (&#8220;right hand&#8221;) and power, he has won the &#8220;victory&#8221;, i.e. salvation, saving acts &#8211; for his people 
Israel. (Note the emphasis on &#8220;victory&#8221;: the word occurs three times in vv.

<B>1 John</B>
<P>
This epistle was addressed to a general audience, unlike those written by Paul. 
It shares a style, phrases and expressions with the Gospel according to John, so 
it is very likely that both were written by the same person. It appears to have 
been circulated to various churches. The author seeks to combat heresy, specifically 
that the spirit is entirely good but matter is entirely evil. John tells his readers 
that morality and ethical behaviour are important for Christians.

offers forgiveness of deviations from God&#8217;s ways, have been adopted as children of God. All who love God (&#8220;the parent&#8221;) also love his or her fellow believers: this love is a dimension of God. The mark of loving God and obeying him 
is loving our fellows (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=1John+5%3A2" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">2</A>). Loving

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.
