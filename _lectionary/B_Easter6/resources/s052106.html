<!-- BEGIN SERMON SEEDS -->

<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>John 15:9-17

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Jesus Calls Us Friends

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.”

<P>Questions:
<BR>As Jesus neared his death, he made a farewell address to his followers, and the theme of love is powerful throughout.  When he knew his hour had come, the Gospel writer says, “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (13:1b). “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (14:15).  And now, “As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you” (15:9).  These words about love help us to understand Jesus’ command to “abide” in him, to understand ourselves as living our lives within his own reality, as part of him in the Body of Christ, the branches of a vine that bear rich fruit for a world hungry for love.  In John, we hear that we are known and cared for, as sheep are loved and cared for by the shepherd who even lays down his life for the flock, rather than running away like a hired hand.  Because of that love, we trust the One who knows us intimately and cares for us tenderly, who holds our very lives in that One’s care.  We are known and held and loved, and commanded, too, to belong to one another, to care for one another, to love one another.  That is the kind of obedience, not blind obedience but trusting obedience, that Jesus inspires and even models, for he has lived his life in trusting obedience to God.  This kind of love and trust is where we live our lives and live out our faith.   The word “commands” is not a legalistic or harsh code of burdensome laws but a clear, comprehensive framework for forming values in every age and every situation, no matter how different our cultures, our technologies, our “sophistication.”  Is this rooted in love? Does this bear fruit for the kingdom of God?  That’s the true test. In the same way, “love” doesn’t mean the romantic, ephemeral feeling that fuels our popular music, our films, and all too often, our personal quest.  Being other-centered rather than self-centered, even to the point of giving up our lives (suddenly or over a lifetime) fulfills the law of Christ, and purity codes and legalisms fall away.  But that is a very difficult thing to do, as we know.  In fact, it’s difficult in our culture, with mobility, career pressure, distractions, and overloaded calendars, to make room for friendship.  We don’t stay long enough to get to know one another, let alone to care about one another.  How does being a member of the church afford us that possibility?  Can we declare church a kind of “safe space” where we can be known and cared about?  Do we see our church membership as something we chose, much as we shop for other “needs” in our lives?  How does our “chosenness,” our being chosen by Jesus, up-end this consumerist approach to being Christians?  Rather than a church “filling my needs,” does it instead call us to fill the needs of others and in so doing, find our deepest needs met?  In what ways do you feel you have been assured by God that everything is going to turn out well, in the end?  In what ways has your church been assured?  Do you feel that Jesus, then, is your friend who tells you what is going on, rather than a master who doesn’t bother to inform the servants about what is planned?  “What makes people friends of Jesus is their being captured by the story, following the sometimes comforting, sometimes disturbing plot that leads to the cross and the empty tomb, and finding in it the light to guide their way in the world” (Brueggemann et al, Texts for Preaching, Year B).  Are you and your church “captured by the story”?  Where is the light taking you?  In what ways is the Stillspeaking God calling you “friends,” not just servants?

<!-- BEGIN OT READING -->

<P><B>Acts 10:44-48</B>

<P>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said, “Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.

<P>God's strong hand and holy arm

<P>God has made known God's victory

<BR>All the ends of the earth have

<P><B>1 John 5:1-6</B>

<P>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith. Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.

<P><B>John 15:9-17</B>

<P> As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.
<P>“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.

<P>Sixth Sunday of Easter
<BR>May 21, 2006
<BR>John 15:9-17

<P>CALL US FRIENDS
<P>The population of Harding County, in the northwest corner of South Dakota, fell by 316 between 1990 and 2000. That may not seem like much of a drop, but it represented almost 25 percent of the people in the county.  At 2,671 square miles, Harding is larger than the state of Rhode Island ; yet it ranks 3,100 out of 3,140 U.S. counties in population. With one resident for every two square miles, the antelope outnumber the people.
   <P> In Harding County, and other places in rural America, young people are moving away, leaving their parents and neighbors to wonder what will become of their hometowns. Faced with questions like that, some people lose hope, and turn inward. But not the members of the First Congregational Church in Buffalo, the county seat. There are four churches in Buffalo, population 380: Roman Catholic, Evangelical Lutheran, Assemblies of God, and United Church of Christ.  First Congregational is known in the community as a church that reaches out. “Everyone is welcome here,” they say, “because God loves everybody.” 
  <P>  Jean Helmer, the licensed lay pastor who leads First Congregational, says there is something special about her flock. “For them, the word neighbor is a verb.  As long as there is need in the community–and there surely is–you serve anyone who wants to be served.” Only ranching, the principal livelihood in Harding County, takes precedence over church. During haying and calving seasons, Jean Helmer says, you don’t see ranchers in church. The rest of the year, they will drive up to 25 miles to attend worship services.
  <P>   According to the UCC Yearbook, First Congregational has 61 members. But Jean Helmer says that many of them have moved away from the county in search of employment. The remnant that remains will not give up, even though many of them are getting along in years. They take turns cleaning the old church building and making needed repairs. They gather for Bible study every Monday. Above all, they care for one another. Neither five years of drought nor economic depression can stop these faithful people.  
   <P> We pray God’s blessings upon the warm, giving people of the First Congregational Church in Buffalo, South Dakota.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
