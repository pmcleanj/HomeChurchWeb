you find the names of 25 books of the Bible in this paragraph? This
is a most remarkable puzzle. Someone found it in the seat pocket on a
flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu, keeping himself occupied for
hours. One man from Illinois worked on this while fishing from his
john boat. Roy Clark studied it while playing his banjo. Elaine Victs
mentioned it in her column once. One woman judges the job to be so
involving, she brews a cup of tea to help calm her nerves. There will
be some names that are really easy to spot . . . that&rsquo;s a fact.
Some people will soon find themselves in a jam, especially since the
book names are not necessarily capitalized. The truth is, from
answers we get, we are forced to admit it usually takes a minister or
scholar to see some of them at the worst. Something in our genes is
responsible for the difficulty we have. Those able to find all of
them will hear great lamentations from those who have to be shown.
One revelation may help, books like! Timothy and Samuel may occur
without their numbers. And punctuation or spaces in the middle are
normal. A chipper attitude will help you compete. Remember, there are
25 books of the Bible lurking somewhere in this paragraph. Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends. John 15:13.</FONT></P>
