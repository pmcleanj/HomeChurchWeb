<I>The importance of remaining connected to the vine. Many Christians
believe it is enough to be faithful, but the Bible calls us also to
be fruitful. The preacher used the analogy of growing up in Mission
and seeing apple trees pruned each March &ndash; (a problematic
analogy since March would be much too late for pruning, but oh well).
The preacher also presented the recently-released statistics from the
last census, that were reported in the local paper; and proposed
causality between the increased income since 1971, and decreased
claim to religious faith in the same period (grounds for a causal
relationship here are actually dubious).</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Set the calendar-clock to
the right date. Easter tells the story of the Resurrection. Over the
&ldquo;Week of Weeks&rdquo; of Easter, we will be called to accept
the Miracle of the Resurrection. Here is our memory scripture for
Easter:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you:
continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in
his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might
remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my
commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends. </I>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
