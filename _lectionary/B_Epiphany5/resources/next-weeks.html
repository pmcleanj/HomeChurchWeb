<h2>Not Rude Just Focused </h2>
<p>&#8220;Simon and his companions hunted for him [Jesus].&nbsp; When they
found him, they said to him, &#8220;everyone is searching for you.&#8221;&nbsp; He
answered, &#8220;Let us go on to the neighboring towns&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; (Mark
1:36-38)&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, one may think that Jesus is being a bit rude in
this week&#8217;s Gospel reading.&nbsp; As you just read, people wanted an
audience with Jesus, some wanted to be healed by Jesus, but Jesus was
ready to move on to the next village, to proclaim his message
there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is going on here?&nbsp; Well, even though we are only
dealing with ten verses in Mark&#8217;s gospel a lot is happening in these
verses.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s break them down and see what Mark is trying to
convey to his readers and to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verses 29-31:</strong>&nbsp; We have problems right off the
bat, Mark tells us that Jesus was in the synagogue because it was the
Sabbath.&nbsp; That being so, Jesus violates the Sabbath rules by
&#8220;working&#8221; in that he has already cast out a demon (Mark 1:23ff.) and
now he will cure Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the healing itself, my father-in law, God rest his soul,
always said that this healing was the greatest testimony to Peter&#8217;s
love and devotion to Jesus.&nbsp; Who else would follow Jesus after he
had healed one&#8217;s mother in law!&nbsp;</p>
<p>All kidding aside, it is probably no small coincidence that Jesus
first healing miracle is to heal a woman.&nbsp; Already Jesus is
tearing down the barriers of gender which will play an important part
in his ministry and will also bring the suspicion and wrath of the
religious leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, notice that as soon as she is healed Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law
begins to serve.&nbsp; While this could be simply a reflection of the
custom of the time, that would expect the female head of the house to
show hospitality toward guests, it could also be an example of how God
serves the disciple by healing the disciples in order that the disciple
might serve in return.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verses 32-34:</strong>&nbsp; &#8220;That evening, at sundown&#8221;
means the Sabbath is now over (Sabbaths, you will recall, go from
sundown to sundown).&nbsp; Now, the whole city knows of what happened
in the synagogue and in Peter&#8217;s house.&nbsp; They begin to bring all
who are sick or possessed with demons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus cured &#8220;many who were sick&#8221; and casts out &#8220;many demons.&#8221;&nbsp;
This is a sign of God&#8217;s reign breaking into the world.&nbsp; It is a
sign of the new reality Jesus is bringing into the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, note that Jesus will not let the demons speak &#8220;because they
knew him.&#8221;&nbsp; This is something Mark does often in his gospel.&nbsp;
Mark has Jesus telling people not to tell others either what he has
done or that they recognize Jesus as coming from God.&nbsp; Scholars
and theologians call this the &#8220;messianic secret&#8221;.&nbsp; Books have been
written about it, suffice to say that Jesus did this because he knew
what kind of Savior he had to be and it wasn&#8217;t just a miracle worker or
one who could cast out demons.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s why&#8230;.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verses 35-39:</strong>&nbsp; Jesus was probably exhausted by
the previous day&#8217;s activities and so he rises early in the morning to
pray.&nbsp; Oh, that it would be that simple!&nbsp; Instead Mark tells
us that Jesus went out to a &#8220;deserted&#8221; place.&nbsp; The last time Jesus
went out to a &#8220;deserted&#8221; place, he was tempted by Satan at the end of
his forty days there.&nbsp; The &#8220;deserted&#8221; place is a place of
temptation, of wrestling with Jesus&#8217; call and vocation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That was probably true here.&nbsp; Would Jesus go back to town to
heal all those who were suffering?&nbsp; Would he risk being labeled a
wonder worker?&nbsp; Or would he stick with the plan to proclaim the
good news and make his way to the cross?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that moment Jesus&#8217; newly chosen disciples come out with the news
that everyone is searching for Jesus, that there are more to be
healed.&nbsp; It is a temptation, but in prayer Jesus has made up his
mind.&nbsp; Jesus will stay the course that is God&#8217;s plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is not being rude, he is just focused on what needs to be done
and so he makes his decision to move on to the next town so that they
might hear the good news.&nbsp; However, as noted by Mark in our
concluding verse, Jesus not only <em>proclaimed</em> the gospel, he continued to <em>live</em> the good news by healing and   cast out demons.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>The first
reading is a testimony to God&#8217;s sovereignty and steadfastness.&nbsp; It
is God who created all things, God rules over all the earth, God has no
equal, God never tires and God gives strength to God&#8217;s people though
they must sometimes wait upon the Lord.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This is the
God whom we serve.&nbsp; This is the loving God who in Jesus heals
us.&nbsp; This is the God who in our brokenness gives us strength and
hope.&nbsp; This is the God we bear witness too.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>This
is one of Paul&#8217;s great statements about Christian liberty.&nbsp; Martin
Luther once said, &#8220;A Christian is perfectly free, subject to
none.&nbsp; A Christian is a dutiful subject of all, subject to
all.&#8221;&nbsp; Those statements seem contradictory but they are not.&nbsp;
It is a paradox and both are true.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Paul begins this
section by stating that he proclaims the Gospel because he has been
commissioned by God to do so.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t proclaim in order to
boast or seek earthly rewards.&nbsp; Paul makes the Gospel available to
all free of charge so that all might know Christ&#8217;s love.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Paul
then describes how he does this.&nbsp; Even though he is free, he
becomes a slave to all.&nbsp; Even though he is now a Christian, he
becomes a Jew in order to preach to Jews.&nbsp; To those who are under
the law (here meaning Jewish law), he becomes like one under the law
though he knows he is free from the law.&nbsp; And, well, you get the
picture.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The point is that Paul is focused in
order to proclaim the Gospel to all people.&nbsp; The love of God in
Christ compels him to preach to all people regardless of who they
are.&nbsp; This he must do to fulfill the law of Christ which is
love.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;When you read the Gospel text, did you notice that Jesus put
off those who wanted to see him in order to move on to the next town?
If so, how did it make you feel? Did you feel Jesus was being rude?
</p>
<p>2. Both Jesus and Paul are focused on the mission and proclamation.
How focused is your faith community on its proclamation and mission?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Isaiah 40:31 is one of the most beloved passages in Isaiah.  How do these words make you feel?  Do they give you hope?</p>
<p>4. How do you feel about Paul&#8217;s words that he became all things to
all people so that he might proclaim the gospel and announce to them
their salvation in Jesus? Is this a good idea? Does your faith
community practice this kind of proclamation?</p>
<p>5.  Do you feel commissioned to proclaim the good news?  In what ways?  Is it a joyful thing, a scary thing or both?</p>
