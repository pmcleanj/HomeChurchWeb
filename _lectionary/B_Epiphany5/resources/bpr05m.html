<B>Isaiah</B>
<P>
This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
Corinth was a major port which also commanded the land route from the 
Peloponnesus peninsula to central Greece. An industrial and ship-building 
centre, it was also a centre for the arts. Its inhabitants came from far and 
wide. In this epistle, Paul answers two letters he has received concerning 
lack of harmony and internal strife in the Corinthian church, a church he had 
founded. Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus (now in Turkey), probably in 57 
AD.

<STRONG>1 Corinthians 9:16-23</STRONG>
<P>Paul has written that, whatever others may think, he is an apostle for he has seen the risen Christ and he has brought many to him, especially at Corinth. So he, as are other apostles, is entitled &#8220;to be accompanied by a believing

<B>Mark</B>
<P>
As witnesses to the events of Jesus life and death became old and died, the 
need arose for a written synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, 
wrote down what Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and 
resurrection  as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic 
gospels were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according to 
Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the <I>John Mark</I> mentioned in 
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.

<STRONG>Mark 1:29-39</STRONG>
<P>Mark has begun to tell us of a day, a sabbath, early in Jesus&#8217; ministry spent at Capernaum. In the synagogue, Jesus has taught &#8220;as one having authority&#8221; (v.

scriptures; he has healed a man possessed by evil &#8211; simply by commanding the evil force to leave him.</P>
<P>Now, with the four disciples he has called so far, he heals the mother of Peter&#8217;s wife. That she serves them shows that she is completely and immediately cured (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Mark+1%3A31" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">31</A>). Note that Jesus &#8220;took her 
by the hand&#8221;: no respected religious leader would do so, especially not on the Sabbath. Was she so seriously ill that Jesus could not wait a few hours to heal her until the Sabbath ended, thus avoiding controversy as to whether this healing 
could be done on the Sabbath? Mark doesn&#8217;t tell us of any.</P>
<P>Then, after the Sabbath, at the start of the next Jewish day (&#8220;that evening&#8221;, v.
