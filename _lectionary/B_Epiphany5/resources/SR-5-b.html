<h4>The Value of the Good News</h4>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Popular Translation</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>16 I shouldn't brag just because I tell others
the Good News of Jesus. In fact, it's my responsibility. If I shouldn't
tell others about Jesus, I should watch out! 17 If I freely choose to
tell others, I receive God's reward. If I don't tell others, I still
have the responsibility he gave me. 18 What is my reward from God? When
I preach about Jesus, I do it without charging people a penny. In this
way, I do not use all the power God gave me to make money.</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>19 When I am free from everyone's donations, I
can concentrate on truly serving everyone. In this way, we can gain
more followers for Jesus. 22 I become like the sick and the weak so
they will follow Jesus. I'll do anything for anyone, so I might save
some. 23 And I'll do anything for the gospel, so I might share in its
promises.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>16 For, if I should evangelize, (it) is not a
brag for me. For, the necessity (of evangelization) lies upon me. For,
woe is to me if I should not evangelize. 17 For if I do this willingly,
I have a reward. But, if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a
commission. 18 So, what is my reward? That evangelizing, I might place
the Good News without expense (before the listener) , not completely
using my power to act in the Good News.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>19 For being free from all, I make myself a
servant to all, in order that I might gain more (converts). 22 I became
weak to the weak, so I might gain the weak. I become everything to
everyone, so in every way I might save some. 23 I do anything for the
gospel, so I might become a partaker in it.</b></p>
<p class="indent">9:18 "not completely using my power to act in the
Good News" Paul referred to his habit of economic self-sufficiency when
he evangelized. In other words, he would not depend upon the
hospitality of the host community for his room and board. Paul would
work for his keep. (See 1 Corinthians 9:1-15 that addresses this issue.)</p>
<p class="indent">9:23 "I do anything for the gospel, so I might become
a partaker in it." Paul was willing to go to any lengths to preach the
gospel, so he might share in the eternal life the gospel promised. Paul
did not differentiate between the means (preaching the Good News) and
its end (eternal life). For Paul, the sufferings of his missionary life
were worth the promised joys of the afterlife.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In 1 Corinthians 9, St. Paul defended his rights as
an apostle. But, we must view his argument in the scope of hospitality,
a cultural institution of the ancient world. Travelers depended upon
the good will of local hosts. In turn, hosts used their hospitality as
a badge of honor. The reputation of a gracious host was far better (and
more influential) than that of the ordinary citizen. Indeed, the host
of a famous guest could enjoy name-dropping and one-upmanship among his
peers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For Paul, the institution of hospitality was
implicitly an impediment to evangelization. The focus should be on
Christ, not on the host or the status of the guest. So, Paul chose to
support himself as a "tent-maker," (Acts 18:3) a worker of leather that
could have performed services for the Roman army. In this way, no one
owed Paul a thing. And Paul didn't owe anything to anyone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But, did the freely-given gospel have value to its
audience? Here's where human nature takes hold. Everyone likes to
receive something "free." But, at what point does "free" mean
"disposable?" After all, worth is determined by cost. Why should Paul's
audience value his message? And why should they respect him who
preached "without cost?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">These insights may explain why Paul felt the
necessity to defend the rights of the apostles. His message did have
worth, far beyond the institution of hospitality, far beyond the whims
of the listener. And the messenger of the Good News deserved respect.
The "apostles" who dedicated their lives to ministry needed food,
shelter, and money to continue the effort. They were worth the cost.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Perhaps the real motivation for Paul's lifestyle
lay in the gift he preached, grace. Grace, the gift of God's very life,
the gift without measure, was given freely to everyone. The message
should reflect the gift it described. If the gift was free, Paul
thought, so should his preaching. In this way, Paul could have
reasoned, he lived out the grace he received. And so could all his
listeners.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ultimately, Paul presented the question of
motivation. Why do we tell others the Good News? Like Paul, we may
enjoy its benefits, but we should remember where it came from and how
we received it. The Good News is a freely given gift from God. Like
grace and the gift of the Spirit, it cannot be measured in a
cost/benefit ratio. But it is a true treasure.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How have you show others the Good News? How have
you enjoyed the Good News? How do you show yourself and others its
ultimate worth?</i></p>
