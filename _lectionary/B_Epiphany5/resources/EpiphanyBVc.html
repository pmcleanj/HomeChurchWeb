			<P>The King James Version of the Bible is a translation that was
			made in 1611, so many of its words sound old-fashioned. But, it is
			not the oldest English Bible. The translation used in the Book of
			Common Prayer is The Bishops Bible, translated in 1568. Even it is
			not as old as the first English translation, the Wycliff Bible of
			1380.</P>
