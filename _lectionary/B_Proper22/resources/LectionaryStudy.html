Chris Haslam writes &ldquo;<I>The book of Job is about suffering: it
seeks to answer the question: why does God allow the faithful to
suffer? The first two chapters, which are in prose, tell of a
legendary figure of Judaism called Job. In this story (which may be
extremely ancient), a very righteous man is tested: is he as godly as
he seems, or is his godliness only an appearance, a result of his
acquisition of wealth and his position as father of a dynasty? His
continuing fidelity through deprivation of all that he possesses
demonstrates that he is truly godly. (In the final act of the drama,
God restores his greatness.) Most of the book is poetry, and appears
to have been written later. It is largely concerned with the meaning
of divine justice and suffering. Through dialogues with Job's
so-called &quot;friends&quot;, we see Job learn that wisdom is
God-given. Humans cannot find the way to it; God gives it to those
who worship him.</I>&rdquo; About this passage Haslam writes &ldquo;Job,
a faithful man, was wealthy with abundant progeny. But his faith may
be because he sees his prosperity as divine providence. So God tests
him, by stripping him of all he has and by ruining his health. In his
distress, three friends have come to &ldquo;console and comfort him&rdquo;
(2:11). He has cursed the day he was born (3:1ff) and has wished that
he could escape from life. His friend Eliphaz has offered what he
thinks is help: for Job to suffer as he does, he must have behaved
badly towards other people. (This is impossible, for Job is of the
greatest integrity.) To Eliphaz, the solution is simple: Job should
pay attention to God&rsquo;s word, repent of the sins he has
committed, and God will restore him to divine favour. Because God is
impartial in his justice, Job would be forgiven his misdeeds, would
find joy, and his prayers would be answered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Now Job doesn&rsquo;t really answer God. Instead, he
seeks to find God, to &ldquo;lay my case before him&rdquo; (v. 4), to
argue his cause as in a courtroom. God would find some faults in his
conduct, but he would listen (v. 6). God is reasonable: he would
acquit Job, &ldquo;an upright person&rdquo; (v. 7), of the charges
which have caused his suffering. But Job can&rsquo;t present his case
to God: he can&rsquo;t find him (vv. 8-9). Eliphaz is wrong: Job has
never deviated from God&rsquo;s ways (v. 11). He has always obeyed
God&rsquo;s commands (v. 12). But God is sovereign: he does what he
wills (v. 13): he will bring to fulfilment whatever he intends for
Job (v. 14). That God can seem so arbitrary in his actions terrifies
Job (v. 15); even more frightening to him is God&rsquo;s
inaccessibility. Job feels deserted by God: &ldquo;God has made my
heart faint&rdquo; (v. 16). The seeming absence of God is a horrible
torment to one who loves him and is used to experiencing him. May he
simply cease to exist!&rdquo;</FONT></P>

Chris Haslam writes &ldquo;<I><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of
collections. The psalms were written over many centuries, stretching
from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile
(about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments,
thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed
be ... Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book.</FONT> &rdquo;</I>
About Psalm 22 Haslam writes &ldquo;Jesus quoted the opening words of
this psalm on the cross. In his suffering, the psalmist feels
deserted by God, despite his cries for help day and night (v. 2).
Even so, he convinced that God is &ldquo;holy&rdquo; (v. 3). His
forebears trusted in God (as he does), and God helped them (v. 4), so
may God help him now (v. 5). His misery is aggravated by those who
mock him; they see his suffering as a sign of God&rsquo;s
ineffectiveness: they jeer and grimace (&ldquo;make mouths&rdquo;, v.
7) at him. But he is convinced that God has been with him since his
infancy (vv. 9-10); only God can help him now. His detractors behave
like savage animals, seeking to devour him (vv. 12-13). (Bulls from
&ldquo;Bashan&rdquo; were particularly strong.) His suffering (v.
14-15) may be physical and mortal: his dry &ldquo;mouth&rdquo; may be
due to fever; it leaves him weak. His detractors are so sure he will
die that they have already auctioned off his clothes (v. 18). May God
help him soon (v. 19). When God restores him, he will spread the word
of God in the community and will praise him in the &ldquo;congregation&rdquo;
(v. 22), the Temple. God will rescue him, and all &ldquo;nations&rdquo;
(v. 27), and those who have died (v. 29). &ldquo;Future generations&rdquo;
(v. 30) too will be told of God&rsquo;s saving deeds, and will
proclaim them.&rdquo;</FONT><B><BR></B><BR><BR>

Chris Haslam writes &ldquo;</FONT><I>Apart from the concluding verses
(which may have been added later), this book is a treatise (or
sermon) rather than a letter. Its name comes from its approach to
Christianity: it is couched is Judaic terms. The identity of the
author is unknown; Origen, c. 200 said that &quot;only God knows&quot;
who wrote Hebrews. The book presents an elaborate analysis, arguing
for the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Christ as revealer and
mediator of God's grace. Basing his argument on the Old Testament,
the author argues for the superiority of Christ to the prophets,
angels and Moses. Christ offers a superior priesthood, and his
sacrifice is much more significant than that of Levite priests. Jesus
is the &quot;heavenly&quot; High Priest, making the true sacrifice
for the sins of the people, but he is also of the same flesh and
blood as those he makes holy.&rdquo;</I> About this passage Haslam
writes &ldquo;The author has written that Christ, the sympathetic and
trustworthy &ldquo;high priest&rdquo;, took on being human in every
way, being tested by suffering. Through his death he is able to
restore us to oneness with God, freeing us from the power of evil
forces &ndash; as his readers are now tempted to desert the faith
(2:14-18).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2>Now he continues: the &ldquo;word&rdquo;
(4:12, </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2>logos</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2>,
essence, principle) of God produces life (&ldquo;living&rdquo;) and
is &ldquo;active&rdquo;: it is able to differentiate between the
faithful and the errant. It has properties only God has: it can judge
our innermost beings (&ldquo;intentions of the heart&rdquo;). &ldquo;It&rdquo;
(God) knows each of us and sees us clearly; we &ldquo;must render an
account&rdquo; (4:13) of our fidelity to him. Even so, God has
provided a remedy for our sin, through Jesus, the &ldquo;great high
priest&rdquo; (4:14), who is transcendent. So we should &ldquo;hold
fast&rdquo; to our (baptismal) creed (&ldquo;confession&rdquo;).
Jesus is a very special &ldquo;high priest&rdquo; (one who makes
sacrifice to obtain our union with God), for he can &ldquo;sympathize
with our weaknesses&rdquo; (4:15), because he has been &ldquo;tested
as we are&rdquo;, but without erring. So let us confidently present
ourselves before God (&ldquo;throne of grace&rdquo;, 4:16), to
receive both forgiveness of past sins and his gifts to help us now
and in the future.&rdquo;</FONT> <B><BR></B><BR><BR>

&ldquo;laid open throated&rdquo; evoked the image of a priest who had
the sacrificial victim on the altar, holding its throat, ready to
cut. One can see weakness and power in the image. An equivalent
English phrase would be &ldquo;to have someone by the throat.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2>to whom the word is for us.&rdquo; is an
ambiguous phrase. The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; can also be translated
&ldquo;against&rdquo; or &ldquo;among.&rdquo; In other words, the
subject discussed (the &ldquo;word&rdquo;) can be God&rsquo;s
judgement against us (&ldquo;to whom there is a word against us&rdquo;).
Or, it can be our worship, prayer, and faith sharing about God (&ldquo;to
whom there is the Word among us&rdquo;). In the context of the Word
as a two-edged sword, both meanings are probably implied (see the
&ldquo;Popular Translation&rdquo; for an example).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>When we look at God, we
see an active, dynamic deity. These few verses from Hebrews portrayed
God&rsquo;s activity in terms of salvation and judgement. His &ldquo;Word&rdquo;
(in this case, another name for God himself) cut to the heart of the
matter (to borrow the analogy used in 4:12). No matter what the
person did or said, God knew his or her real intent. And God would
judge accordingly.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>The analogy of the sword
in 4:12 and laying out the victim by the throat in 4:13 led up to the
image of Christ as High Priest in 4:14-5:10. The images of Christ
crucified and the Second Coming pointed to the End Times. The author
of the Hebrews made a unique contribution to these images by placing
them in the context of worship. In other words, salvation itself was
an act of sacrifice Jesus made to the Father. But, since the believer
tied him or herself to Christ crucified in Baptism, the believer
joined Christ as the victim. The Word of God was ready to strike. The
coming judgement/salvation was the ultimate sacrifice to the Father.
That sacrifice began on the cross and continues today.</FONT></P>

Chris Haslam writes &ldquo;<I>As witnesses to the events of Jesus
life and death became old and died, the need arose for a written
synopsis. Tradition has it that Mark, while in Rome, wrote down what
Peter remembered. This book stresses the crucifixion and resurrection
as keys to understanding who Jesus was. When other synoptic gospels
were written, i.e. Matthew and Luke, they used the Gospel according
to Mark as a source. Mark is most probably the John Mark mentioned in
Acts 12:12: his mother's house was a meeting place for believers.</I></FONT>
&rdquo; About this passage Haslam writes &ldquo;Jesus continues to
teach about what it means to follow him. The man kneels as to a
master; such a show of piety is abnormal. (People stood to pray.)
Perhaps Jesus&rsquo; response (v. 18) is a careful one. Rabbis
(teachers) were not usually addressed as &ldquo;good&rdquo;; only God
is good. The man insists that he has always kept those of the Ten
Commandments which deal with relationships among people (vv. 19-20),
and Jesus believes him (&ldquo;Jesus ... loved him&rdquo;, v. 21),
but what about his relationship with God? Jesus seems to recognize
that the man puts his trust in his own piety and wealth, in his
achievements, but wealth stands in the way of his gaining oneness
with God &ndash; so Jesus tests him (v. 21). The man&rsquo;s shock
and departure (v. 22) show that Jesus is correct. Wealth was seen as
a sign of God&rsquo;s favour, but in the man&rsquo;s case, it gets in
the way of true discipleship.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>But we cannot save ourselves &ndash; only God can
save us (v. 27). It is &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; for humans to enter
the Kingdom through their own efforts, even when blessed with
God-given possessions, as v. 25 says in a grotesque image. Peter&rsquo;s
words in v. 28 carry with them a question: </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2>what
is the reward of those who are faithful now?</FONT></EM> <FONT SIZE=2>Jesus
answers: those who have given up their possessions and natural family
for the sake of him and of his mission will receive much: in this
life, they will share in the Christian community (although they may
suffer); in the &ldquo;age to come&rdquo; (v. 30, in the kingdom),
they will have eternal life. Finally v. 31: the &ldquo;first&rdquo;
are those who have status now; the &ldquo;last&rdquo; are those who
have left everything. In entering the kingdom, the &ldquo;last&rdquo;
will be God&rsquo;s obvious choice for admission.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;<FONT SIZE=2>What is the greatest need in our
society? To what lengths will people seek answers to that need?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The political season is upon us. Politicians from
every side promise us policies and programs to satisfy every need.
Have a problem? Look around. You'll soon find a candidate that will
&quot;empower&quot; you with a solution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Of course, the cynic in all of us knows better. But,
that skeptical piece of knowledge does not stop our inner craving for
answers to our problems. Sometimes we seek the public means,
sometimes private. No matter how hard we try, no matter how much
money or influence we have, it does not seem to be enough. We still
seek that which will make us happy, that which leave us satisfied.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>A man knelt before Jesus to find an answer to his
search. What Jesus said to the man challenged the fundamental
direction of his life.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=2>The gospel
addressed two issues of faith. First, what can I do to gain the
afterlife? And, second, who can help me when I fall short of the
goal? In Mark, the answer to the first question was the means to
eternal life: trust. The answer to the second question was the object
of trust: God. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=2>As the scene
opens, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt as a sign of respect, and then
addressed him with the phrase &quot;Good Master.&quot; Jesus rejected
the term &quot;good&quot; since the title could be a trap [17-18].
But in the exchange, the man inquired about eternal life; this was a
sign that the man saw the path (&quot;journey&quot; in 17) Jesus and
his followers took as the means to eternal life. So Jesus asked about
the man's moral life [19]; how had he adhered to God's law (Ten
Commandments numbers 4-8)?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>When the man answered in the affirmative, Jesus moved
to the next step: the invitation to fellowship [21]. But the cost was
high. The man must give up his possessions, not necessarily his
personal wealth, but his attachments to extended family and to
business. The man would be a social &quot;orphan&quot;; his family
would be the Church.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>If the man were to give up attachments, he would
abandon his reliance on the mentor-client system of the ancient
world. As the note above implied, mentors acted as &quot;middle men&quot;
between richer-ruling families and poorer-servant families. For
favors bestowed by the richer families, poorer families (i.e., the
&quot;clients&quot;) would pay kickbacks, taxes, and bribes. They
would also boost the reputation of the richer families, thereby
cementing their higher status. Middle men between the families grew
in wealth and influence as the relationship between the families
became tighter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The questioner was rich. More important, however, he
used the mentor-client system to his advantage of his reputation.
Jesus asked him to give up that system and all its perks. The man
would become a typical follower.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>But what would he gain? Instead of having clients, he
would be a client of God the Father. Instead of having others
dependent on him, he would be totally dependent upon God. This would
be a true act of faith. He then would be truly ready to follow Jesus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>In the end, the man could not join Jesus and walked
away. He could not give up what he took most of his life
accumulating: wealth and power.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus remarked
about the difficulty for the rich to enter God's Kingdom [23-25]. In
the time of Jesus, riches implied multiple family, business, and
political connections with their conflicting interests; the life of
the rich was stressful and overburdened. In contrast, the lifestyle
of Jesus was simple and uncluttered. But even simplicity did not
guarantee salvation [26]; the simple and the poor did have problems
that distracted from faith. Jesus reminded his followers that faith
was a gift from God; he would take care of any and all problems when
faith is a priority [27]. This attitude had its roots in Judaism.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Catechism Theme: Faith: Desire For and Dependance
Upon God (CCC 27-30)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2>In Mark's gospel, the rich man craved
more than what he had. But, he did not seek to satisfy that craving
with the accumulation of more wealth and power. Indeed, he tried to
live a moral life. So, he sought the wisdom of Jesus to answer that
craving.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2>Each human being has that same craving.
Within each of us lies a desire for that which transcends time and
space, that which will satisfy for a lifetime and beyond. God created
us with that craving so we would seek him out. For only in him will
we find true happiness.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2>As we find God, we discover we are utter
dependant upon him. That finding can be too much for some to bear.
They want control, power, influence. They become, at best,
indifferent to religious expression. At worst, they become hostile
and violent against the desire to seek God. Nonetheless, apathy or
persecution cannot stop the inner yearning that finds itself in every
person.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2>Not only is the search for God universal,
its answer can only be found in relationship with God. Only when we
find we cannot be happy alone will we find happiness in God. Only
when we give up the notion that our riches, personality, or power can
give us the happiness we seek, only then will we be ready to receive
the Kingdom, the very presence of God himself.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2><I>How have your inner yearnings brought
you to God? How has he satisfied those yearnings?</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2>Throughout life's challenges and
struggles, a yearning still drives us on. The yearning finds its
first refreshment in a faith relationship with God. But that yearning
drives us to a closer relationship with our maker. It makes moral and
religious demands on us. Despite the daily distractions of life,
temptations to look for answers elsewhere, and our own moral
weaknesses, let us remember the words of Jesus: &quot;For God,
nothing is impossible.&quot;</FONT></P>

(Jesus realizes that the man is paralyzed by his possessions.) In
what ways do our possessions weigh us down?</FONT></FONT></P>

shocking to Jesus' hearers in verse 23? (It was assumed that rich
people had an easier time with the various religious duties imposed

people to get &quot;in?&quot; (The distractions rich people can
afford.) Do we think Jesus means that rich people cannot get &quot;in?&quot;

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
