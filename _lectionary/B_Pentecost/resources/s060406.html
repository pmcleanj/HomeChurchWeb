<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Acts 2:1-21

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Pentecost People

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>“I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh...”

<P>Questions:
<BR>There have been manifestations, remarkable displays of God’s Spirit in the Bible before, of course, with sound and light and amazing “special effects,” as we call them today.  But those events, like Moses on the mountaintop and Jesus transfigured, were reserved for only a few witnesses, the most “inside” of insiders.  Here, at the dawn of a new era, on the birthday of a church called to spread to the ends of the earth, the display is for all.  Not just the disciples, gathered in a room, getting themselves together after Jesus is once again departed.  Not just the holiest or the most faithful or the most learned, not just the believers, not just those who were with Jesus on the road or witnesses to his Resurrection.  No, in this case, at this moment, “all flesh,” male and female, old and young, slave and free, are invited and included, and just to make sure they know they’re included, the formidable obstacle of a multitude of languages is overcome by a sweeping wind and an uplifting Spirit that drives those disciples out, out into the world beyond their walls and the theoretical but fragile safety they provide.  Out, into the world and compelled to spread the Good News of what God is doing in a new day.  On a Jewish feast that celebrated new life and new crops by offering a gift of first fruits in gratitude and praise, these Jewish “ignorant, backwater folks” (a stereotype conveyed by the term “Galileans,” but lost to us today as we read the text) become impassioned, eloquent spokespersons for the gift of new life, the beginning of a brand new era in which God is fulfilling promises, salvation draws near, and “God is offering salvation as the end of history draws near” (Mathew L. Skinner, The Day of Pentecost, New Proclamation Year B 2006).  There is an interesting slant to this reading for a church that proclaims wholeheartedly that God is still speaking, and Skinner makes a case for it as he focuses on Peter’s alteration of the text from Joel, saying “in the last days” instead of “after these things.”  In fact, commentators agree that Joel was speaking ominously of destruction and death while Peter speaks of the promise of new life.  In Peter’s preaching and interpretation, Skinner says, “the living words of the scriptures continue to nurture and guide the people of God, even as they move into new circumstances offering new realities and challenges” (New Proclamation Year B).  Peter, according to Skinner, does what we too need to do today.  Right in the midst of these astounding and undoubtedly confusing events, he interprets them as he experiences them.  “Peter does not perceive in advance what God is doing; he discovers it as he goes along.  His resources for making sense of God’s activities through believers are his own past and present experiences and the scriptures that record the stories of God from the past.  Peter does not interpret scripture so much as he is pressed to interpret the present moment through the defining lens of the scriptural witness.”  In what ways do you share Peter’s experience?  What are the amazing but confounding things God is doing in the midst of the life of your church, your community, this nation, and the world?  As you “go along,” how have you turned to your past experiences to interpret what God is doing now?  What about your present experiences; how do they help you understand what God is about?  Is the way the Bible is interpreted in your church helpful to the members of your community as they view their lives, past, present, and future, through the lens of scripture?  How does this text illustrate the way that God is still speaking today?  Clearly the crowd is hungry for the word brought by the Spirit-filled disciples, even though some are immediately cynical and scoffing.  Yet, we know from later verses that the church expanded from just over one hundred to three thousand in one day.  A mega-church is born on a single day! What do you think is the heart of the word that brought so many new believers to the newborn church?  “That which happens at Pentecost is thus no inner mystical experience, but an outpouring of God’s energy that touches every life present” (Brueggemann et al, Texts for Preaching, Year B).  What do you imagine that energy felt like for the foreign visitors in town for the religious festival?  How was it in continuity with the prophetic tradition of the Jewish people?  If the festival of Pentecost happened at the time of spring harvest, how might we experience this Pentecost event as a different kind of harvest, yielding life-giving fruits?  The same Spirit that drew the little band of disciples out into the world also shaped them into a community.  What is the balance in your church like, between reaching out and nurturing the faith life of the community?  How do these two impulses relate to each other?  According to Marcus Borg, “The coming of the Spirit is the reversal of Babel, the beginning of the reunion of the human community” (Reading the Bible Again for the First Time). What is the new thing God is doing in the life of your church, in your own life, bringing a new day and new hope?

<P><B>Acts 2:1-21</B>

<P>When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.

<P>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—in our own languages we hear them speaking about God’s deeds of power." All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" But others sneered and said, "They are filled with new wine."

<P>But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:

<P>	'In the last days it will be, God declares,
	that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
	and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
	and your young men shall see visions,
	and your old men shall dream dreams.
<P>	Even upon my slaves, both men and women,
	in those days I will pour out my Spirit;
	and they shall prophesy.
<P>	And I will show portents in the heaven above
	and signs on the earth below,
	blood, and fire, and smoky mist.
<P>	The sun shall be turned to darkness
	and the moon to blood,
	before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.
<P>	Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'


<P><I>or</I>

<P><B>Ezekiel 37:1-14</B>

<P>The hand of the LORD came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, "Mortal, can these bones live?" I answered, "O Lord GOD, you know." Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD."

<P>So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.

<P>Then he said to me, "Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.' Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken and will act, says the LORD."

<P>O God, how manifold are your works!
<BR>In wisdom you have made them all;
<BR>the earth is full of your creatures.

<P>Yonder is the sea, great and wide;
<BR>it is teeming with countless

<P>There go the ships, 
<BR>and Leviathan that you formed to

<P>These all look to you  
<BR>to give them their food in due
<BR>season;

<P>when you give to them, they gather it up;
<BR>when you open your hand, they are
<BR>filled with good things.

<P>When you hide your face, they are dismayed;
<BR>when you take away their breath,
<BR>they die and return to their dust.

<P>When you send forth your spirit, they are created;
<BR>and you renew the face of the ground.

<P>May the glory of God endure forever;
<BR>may God rejoice in God's works-

<P>God who looks on the earth and it trembles;
<BR>God who touches the mountains and they smoke.

<P>I will sing to God as long as I live;
<BR>I will sing praise to my God while I have being.

<P><B>Romans 8:22-27</B>

<P>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

<P>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

<P>"When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.

<P>But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you about them.

<P>"I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.

<P>"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

<P>Pentecost Sunday
<BR>June 4, 2006
<BR>Acts 2:1-21



<P>Pentecost People
<P>Doesn’t everyone hope for good news?  The disciples of Jesus received good news in the rush of a mighty wind. By the power of the Holy Spirit they became Pentecost People. Their lives, and the world, would never be the same. 
     <P>We are Pentecost People, the bearers and sharers of good news in our age. Today, many congregations will give to the Strengthen the Church special mission offering of the United Church of Christ. Last year this offering helped start dozens of new churches like Maranatha Indonesian Fellowship UCC, our first Indonesian congregation!  
     <P>Christians in Indonesia are a small, little-tolerated population. Children are bullied, women abused and men refused work. A group of Indonesian Christians, mostly from Sulawesi, fled the persecution and came to New Hampshire. Three families began worshiping at First Congregational UCC of Rochester, where they felt nurtured. Several other families, who couldn’t speak English, yearned to worship in their own language. The Maranatha Indonesian Fellowship UCC was born, meeting in a variety of locations with the Rev. Sandra Londong Pontoh as their minister. In June, 2004, hosted by Union Congregational UCC in Madbury, they became the first new church start in New Hamnpshire’s Carroll-Strafford Association since 1914! They are Pentecost People.
     <P>Through our gifts to Strengthen the Church, we strengthen and renew congregations. We fund leadership for new congregations. We provide exciting programs for youth and young adults. We fund leadership development for the whole church.  Your generous gifts are used, half by your Conference and half by Local Church Ministries, for these purposes. Good news: we are Pentecost People!

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
