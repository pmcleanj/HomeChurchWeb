<B>Acts</B>
<P>
This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

attempts to describe the event in human terms, but it is never possible to explain a divine mystery: all we can do is say what it is like. The coming of the Holy Spirit is the gift inaugurating the final stage of the salvation story (or history,

<B>Ezekiel</B>
<P>
Ezekiel was a prophet and a priest. His ministry began before the 
conquest of Judah in 587 BC, and continued in exile in Babylon. This 
book is the foundation for both Jewish and Christian visionary or 
apocalyptic literature, e.g. Revelation (or The Apocalypse.) It is a 
book that contains many strange things (strange because we do not 
understand them, e.g. Ezekiel eating a scroll), but the prophet's 
message to the exiles is clear: he assures his hearers of God's abiding 
presence among them, and he emphasizes God's involvement in the events 
of the day, so that Israel and all nations "will know that I am the Lord". 
For the first time, we see the importance of the individual in his 
relationship to God. To a dispersed and discouraged people, he brings 
a message of hope: hope that God will restore them to their homeland 
and the temple.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>Romans</B>

Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<LI>the <EM>righteous</EM> who condemned Jesus are wrong: he is God's agent 
(<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+16%3A10" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">16:10</A>); and </LI>
<LI>he has defeated sin (<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+16%3A11" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">16:11</A>).</LI>
</LS>
<P> For example, to heal on the Sabbath is not sinful.</P>
<P>Then <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+16%3A12-13" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">16:12-13</A>: the Spirit will 
tell them things Jesus has not. In his guidance, he will speak what comes to him from God (as Jesus has spoken what the Father has told him.) The Spirit will prophesy about events &#8220;to come&#8221;. The Spirit will reveal the essential nature of 
God, and show Christ&#8217;s essential nature and power (&#8220;glorify&#8221;, 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=John+16%3A14" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">16:14</A>). Whether the word comes from 
the Father, the Son, or the Spirit it is the same.</P>
