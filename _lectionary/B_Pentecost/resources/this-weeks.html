<h1>THE SPIRIT BLOWS WHERE IT WILL</h1>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a story told   by Pastor William Willimon, the campus pastor at Duke University, that   shows the power of the Spirit.&nbsp; One afternoon Pastor Willimon received   a phone call from an irate parent.&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare you,&rdquo; the man   began, &ldquo;I hold you personally responsible for this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Pastor Willimon   replied.&nbsp; The father was livid, upset because his graduate school   bound daughter had just informed him that she was going to chuck it   all (&ldquo;throw it all away&rdquo; was the way the father described it) and   go do mission work with the Presbyterians in Haiti.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that absurd!&rdquo;   shouted the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;A BS degree in mechanical engineering from   Duke University and she&rsquo;s going to dig ditches in Haiti.&nbsp; You,   Pastor, are completely irresponsible to have encouraged her to do this.&nbsp;   I hold you personally responsible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pastor Willimon was   a bit stunned, &ldquo;Me?&nbsp; What have I done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You?&rdquo; The   father continued, &ldquo;You ingratiated yourself to her, filled her head   with all that religion stuff.&nbsp; She likes you, that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s   doing this foolishness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pastor Willimon counted   to ten and then replied, &ldquo;Now look my friend, weren&rsquo;t you the one   who had her baptized?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; the father said.&nbsp;   &ldquo;And then, didn&rsquo;t you read her Bible stories, take her to Sunday   school, let her go on trips with the youth group?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,   yes,&rdquo; the father said, &ldquo;but&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t but me!&rdquo;   Pastor Willimon was on a roll.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault that she believed   all that stuff, that she&rsquo;s gone and thrown it all away on Jesus, it&rsquo;s   not my fault.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the one who introduced her to Jesus and   to the Holy Spirit, not me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the father said meekly,   &ldquo;But all we wanted her to be was a Presbyterian.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Pastor   Willimon concluded, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve messed up and the Spirit has made her   a disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading (Ezekiel 37:1-14)</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of Ezekiel,   even dried up bones are brought back to life through the Spirit.&nbsp;   As Ezekiel proclaims, &ldquo;<em>This is what the Sovereign Lord says to   these bones: &lsquo;I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life.   I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover   you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelite people   were just returning from exile in Babylon.&nbsp; When they entered &ldquo;their&rdquo;   land, it was not the luscious and &ldquo;verdant&rdquo; pastures and hillsides   they were expecting.&nbsp; Instead, they found hunger, disease, poverty   &ndash; ugliness and disaster.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that at least once or twice,   these people newly returned &ldquo;home,&rdquo; looked with longing eyes back   toward their captivity in Babylon.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was out of these   feelings, this despair, that the &ldquo;dry bones&rdquo; vision came to Ezekiel.&nbsp;   In the vision, the people of Israel are promised life where it only   looked like death.&nbsp; Even parched, bleached, dead bones are no match   for the windstorm of the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ezekiel begins to   speak, there is movement.&nbsp; The bones don&rsquo;t stand still.&nbsp;   The bones arise.&nbsp; They begin to rattle, to clatter, to come together.&nbsp;   They attach and form tendons and flesh and skin.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hip bone   connects to the thigh bone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the Spirit of God, in the   valley of bleached bones, breath begins.&nbsp; The Spirit of God blows   and life begins anew.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading (Acts 2:1-21) </h4>
      <p>In one of Martin Luther&rsquo;s sermons for   Pentecost he said:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <p><em>The Holy Spirit descended from   heaven and filled all the assembled multitude, and they appeared with   parting, fiery tongues and preached so unlike they were wont to do that   all men were filled with amazement. The Spirit came pouring into their   hearts, making them different beings, making them creatures who loved   and willingly obeyed God. This change was simply the manifestation of   the Spirit himself, his work in the heart. He wrote in those hearts   his pure and fiery flame restoring them to life and causing them to   respond with fiery tongues and efficient hands. They became new creatures,   aware of possessing altogether different minds and different tendencies.   Then all was life and light; understanding, will and heart burned and   delighted in whatever was acceptable to God. Such is the</em> <em>true   distinction between the written law of God and the spiritual. Herein   we perceive what is the work of the Holy Spirit.</em> [Volume VII:329-336   of <u>The Sermons of Martin Luther</u>, published by Baker Book House   (Grand Rapids, MI). &nbsp;<br />
	      </p>
	    </ul>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Martin Luther says,   &ldquo;Herein we perceive what is the work of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;   The Spirit gave those men a new voice 2000 years ago.&nbsp; The disciples   went from being scared, frightened, and intimidated to becoming proud,   outspoken (sometimes) martyrs of the faith.&nbsp; They still had their   same fears, they still were the same people, but at the same time, as   Luther said, &ldquo;They became new creatures, aware of possessing altogether   different minds and different tendencies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Somehow the Spirit   blew strength and fervor and life into them.&nbsp; They were never the   same.&nbsp;<br />
	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of this   God-given gift, thousands of people standing there &ndash; Parthians, Medes   and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus   and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene   &ndash; all of them were touched by the flame.&nbsp; Much like fire spreads   by contact, so the Holy Spirit grows and spreads.&nbsp; By one person   to another, from ember to flame, from spark to bonfire.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame has spread   &ndash; all the way through the centuries to today.&nbsp; Oh &hellip; it sometimes   seems to be dying ashes &hellip; there are times when we wonder where the   Spirit of God is.&nbsp; But we are promised the Spirit is here.&nbsp;   Even in dry bones.</p>
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel (John 15:26-27, 16:4b-15) </h4>
	  <p>In Jesus&rsquo; long speech during his last   meal with the disciples, he again reminds them that he is leaving. In   hearing this news, the disciples are grief-stricken.&nbsp; Their sorrow   is so palpable that they are unable to even ask a basic question, &ldquo;Where   are you going?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
	  
	  <p>But in the midst of their sorrow, Jesus   promises that they will not be left alone.&nbsp; Jesus promises to send   the Paraclete &ndash; an Advisor, a Counselor &ndash; in his place.&nbsp; He   warns them (in the verses not included in the pericope) that they will   be persecuted.&nbsp; But, he promises, they will not be without help.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The disciples are promised that internally   the Spirit of Jesus will dwell with them.&nbsp; They are not left desolate.&nbsp;   They are not left in a valley of dry bones.&nbsp; They are not left   hiding in a room cowering from their enemies.&nbsp; The Spirit will   come.&nbsp; The Spirit will transform.&nbsp; The Spirit will bring life.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Each of these scriptures relate to different   times in our lives or the lives of our congregations.&nbsp; Sometimes   moments of jubilation and transformation occur (Acts).&nbsp; At other   times, hope seems only a dream in the midst of death (Ezekiel).&nbsp;   There are times when the Spirit of God seems a little too &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo;   and we would prefer &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; instead (John).&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>On Pentecost Sunday, in whatever place   we find ourselves, know that the Spirit continues to abide. We see that   in the story I related above with William Willimon.&nbsp; The Spirit   can blow gently and softly.&nbsp; It may be a breeze.&nbsp; But sometimes   (much to our chagrin) it can come in like a whirlwind.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s   true, sometimes you don&rsquo;t even know that anything is happening.&nbsp;   But other times you feel as though the foundation itself is being lifted   below you. When the Spirit is at work, always there is new direction,   new ideas, new places, new life &ndash; for you, for your congregation,   for the Christian Church on earth.&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
        <p>1. How has the Spirit worked     in your life?&nbsp; As a gentle breeze?&nbsp; As a hurricane?</p>
<p>
   2. How has the Spirit worked     in your congregation?&nbsp; Amongst other Christians?</p>
<p>3. When have you felt as depleted     as the dry bones in Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision?&nbsp; What brought you &ldquo;back     to life&rdquo;?</p>
<p>4. Jesus tells the disciples     that he is leaving but the Paraclete will be with them.&nbsp; Is this     comforting?&nbsp; Disconcerting?&nbsp; What did this mean for them?&nbsp;     For us?</p>
<p>5. In what ways are our congregations     &ldquo;alive in the Spirit?&rdquo;&nbsp; How are we like &ldquo;dead bones?&rdquo;</p>
