Old Testament lesson for the lectionary deals with two important
subjects:&nbsp; the selection and coronation of David as king over
all of Israel and David&rsquo;s taking of Jerusalem so that it could
be made into the capital of the nation.</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>5:1-5 deals with David ascending to the throne of a
united Israel.&nbsp; Israel was really divided around two centers of
government.&nbsp; The first was that of Judah, centered around the
city of Hebron, and consisting of the two tribes of Judah and
Benjamin.&nbsp; The second was that of Israel, centered around the
city of Gibeon, and consisting of the ten remaining tribes of the
people of Israel.&nbsp; Although Judah was made up of only two
tribes, those two tribes together were so large that they equaled the
power of the other ten tribes combined.&nbsp; Immediately upon Saul&rsquo;s
death, David was crowned king of Judah, while Ishbaal (also called in
scripture, Ishbosheth), one of Saul&rsquo;s sons, was anointed as
king over the northern kingdom of Israel.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>David reigned over Judah for seven years, quickly
building it into an even more secure and powerful entity than it was
during the time of Saul.&nbsp; But Ishbaal proved a highly
unsatisfactory choice for the northern kingdom.&nbsp; In short order,
David&rsquo;s army conquered the army of Ishbaal, the people of the
northern kingdom revolted against Ishbaal and assassinated him.&nbsp;
The leaders of the northern kingdom, recognizing the untenable
position they were in, then approached David and requested that he
accept the crown of the northern kingdom as well as the southern
kingdom, and merge them into one nation (4:1--5:5).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The elders of Israel wanted David to be their king
for three reasons.&nbsp; First, he was their kin (&ldquo;Look, we are
your bone and flesh&rdquo; 5:1).&nbsp; They were all Israelites,
descendants of one of the twelve sons of Israel (Jacob) (cf.
19:12-13; Gen. 29:14; Judges 9:2).&nbsp; Second, he had proven his
military prowess.&nbsp; Consequently, David offered to Israel the
potential for a lasting peace and security through the elimination of
its national enemies (5:2,<!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><A HREF="http://www.piut.org/ordinarytime14b.htm#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>[1]<!--[endif]--></FONT></FONT></A>
cf. I Sam. 17:32, 45-47; 18:7; 25:28).&nbsp; Third, David had been
divinely appointed to Israel&rsquo;s throne and had been anointed by
Israel&rsquo;s greatest judge, Samuel, toward that end (vs. 2, &ldquo;The
Lord said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people
Israel&rdquo;).&nbsp; This meant that the people were aware of
Samuel&rsquo;s anointing and therefore God&rsquo;s choice of David as
king over Israel (I Sam. 16:1).&nbsp; It was for these three reasons
that the elders of Israel came to the king of Judah and requested him
to become king over the entire nation.&nbsp; David accepted, and is
king over the united nation for 33 years &ndash; years that indeed do
bring stability, power and security to the nation (5:5).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>An immediate problem besetting David, upon his
ascension to the throne of a united Israel, was the choice of the
capital.&nbsp; If he chose to remain in Hebron, the northern kingdom
would be offended.&nbsp; And if he chose to reign in Gibeon, the
southern kingdom would feel slighted.&nbsp; Where could he place his
capital in a site equally acceptable to both the north and the south?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>David decided that what he needed was a neutral city
for his capital, one that was relatively centrally located in the
united nation and yet one that had never been under the control of or
had been conquered by any of the tribes of Israel.&nbsp; He settled
on Urushalim<!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><A HREF="http://www.piut.org/ordinarytime14b.htm#_ftn2" NAME="_ftnref2"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>[2]<!--[endif]--></FONT></FONT></A>,
a Jebusite city high upon a mountain surrounded by deep valleys that
made it difficult to siege.&nbsp; Although it was in the very
heartland of Israel, it has never been conquered by the Israelites,
probably because its topography made it so impregnable.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Urushalim was an ancient city, listed as a city in
Egyptian texts dated 1850 BCE, and mentioned in the Bible for the
first time in Genesis 14:17-24 in the story of Abraham&rsquo;s
meeting with its king, Melchizedek, around 2,000 BCE.&nbsp;
Archaeological excavations of the city reveal that it was a small
walled city in the Early Bronze Age during the third millennium
before the Common Era.&nbsp; So by the time David determined that it
would be his capital, Urushalim was already over 1,000 and perhaps
even nearly 3,000 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>&nbsp;</U></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The account of David&rsquo;s taking of Urushalim is
simply enough (5:6-10).&nbsp; The Jebusites felt confident that their
natural and human-made defenses would be more than adequate to once
again defeat Israel&rsquo;s attempt to take the city.&nbsp; But David
did not attempt to breach those sturdy defenses.&nbsp; Instead, he
sent a small contingent of troops through the watercourse into the
city.&nbsp; Stealing into the city at night, they opened the gates
and David&rsquo;s army rushed into the city, taking it by surprise
and quickly subduing its Jebusite occupants.&nbsp; Not only did the
city fall to David, but most of its infrastructure remained in place
because it had not been subjected to attack!&nbsp; Thus, the author
of II Samuel testifies, &ldquo;David became greater and greater; for
the Lord, the God of hosts, was with him&rdquo; (5:10).&nbsp; God,
who leads the armies of heaven also led Israel in this battle through
the faithful leadership of David, and thus gave this city into the
hands of the Israelites!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The conquering of Urushalim was one of the most
important actions of David&rsquo;s monarchy.&nbsp; This city, of
course, became Jerusalem &ndash; not only the capital of the new
Israelite monarchy, but &ldquo;the city of David&rdquo;, the city
that became the abode of Israel&rsquo;s Temple and the center of
Israel&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp; It became the abode of Israel&rsquo;s
political, economic and religious powers that formed and sustained it
as a nation.&nbsp; Eventually, it became a worldwide city (as put by
Isaiah, &ldquo;a house of prayer for all the peoples&rdquo;, 56:7),
the center of three international religions (Judaism, Christianity,
Islam), and the model of the city as God intends it someday to be
(Rev. 21-22).&nbsp; And its theological, political and economic
importance for three millennia is caught up in its very name. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Since the root name for Jerusalem is Urushalim (that
is, &ldquo;Foundation of Shalem&rdquo; in Hebrew and, likely, in the
Canaanite tongue), the question must be asked, &ldquo;Who was
Shalem?&rdquo;&nbsp; Shalem was the local god of pre-Israelite
Canaan.&nbsp; It was the god symbolized in the planet Venus, the
evening star &ndash; a god of nature and of fertility.&nbsp; After
the Israelite conquest of Canaan, Shalem was identified with the
Canaanite gods Ashtar and Molech.&nbsp; These gods were in reality,
the Canaanite manifestations of the deity worshipped throughout the
Near East &ndash; Ba&rsquo;al.&nbsp; And it would be Ba&rsquo;al that
would become, in Israelite theology, the origin of the figure of
Satan!&nbsp; Thus, the name for that city of Urushalim expressed the
city&rsquo;s devotion to the God Shalem or (in other words)
Ba&rsquo;al.<!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><A HREF="http://www.piut.org/ordinarytime14b.htm#_ftn3" NAME="_ftnref3"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>[3]<!--[endif]--></FONT></FONT></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If the city Urushalim or Shalem means &ldquo;foundation
of Shalem&rdquo; or the city of Shalem, what, then, does the prefix
<I>Je </I>mean?&nbsp; It is the anglicized version of the Hebrew word
&ldquo;Yah&rdquo;, and thus an abbreviation for the word &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo;.&nbsp;
When King David conquered Jerusalem, he didn&rsquo;t change the name
of the city.&nbsp; Rather, what he did was to add the prefix, &ldquo;Yah&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;Je&rdquo;) to the city&rsquo;s old name &ldquo;Urushalim&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Thus, David added Israel&rsquo;s God to the name of a city that had
previously been named for the god Shalem.&nbsp; The name Yahweh was
not substituted for the name of Shalem; it was added to it!&nbsp;
Under David, this city now had the name, &ldquo;City of Yahweh; City
of Shalem&rdquo;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In a most profound sense, David had captured in his
new name for his new capital city the tension of every city.&nbsp;
Just as was the case in Jerusalem, so it is the case in your city or
in mine that our city is, at one and the same time, the City of
Yahweh and the City of Ba&rsquo;al, the City of God and the City of
Satan!&nbsp; Every city is Jeru-<I>salem</I> &ndash; the city of
Ba&rsquo;al (or Satan).&nbsp; And yet, every city is <I>Je</I>-usalem
&ndash; the city of God.&nbsp; Both Jerusalem and every city is city
that contains the power and influence of both forces within its
borders or walls.&nbsp; The very name of Israel&rsquo;s primary and
idealized city expresses the foundational urban message of the Bible.
Jerusalem &ndash; and every city &ndash; is the battleground between
the forces of God and the forces of Satan for domination of its
people and their structures.&nbsp; And that battle goes on in every
one of us!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Little did David realize that in his act to capture
and then rename Urushalim to Jerusalem, he was symbolizing and even
predicting the course of his own tenure as Israel&rsquo;s monarch.&nbsp;
He would be the king &ldquo;who was after God&rsquo;s own heart&rdquo;,
whose spontaneous love for God (6:1-23) expressed itself in
magnificent psalms of praise (22:2&mdash;23:7 and many Psalms), who
would seek to act justly to protect the powerless (9:1-13) and to
share wealth in order to protect the cause of the poor (12:1-6).&nbsp;
He would seek to build a City (and nation) of God.</P>

But David would also be a poignant example of good gone awry, of
adultery and murder, intrigue and deceit.&nbsp; He would, at times,
be dominating, greedy, lustful and power-mad &ndash; the very essence
of <I>Shalem</I> (e.g., 11:1-15; 11:16-27; 15:1-31).&nbsp; And the
consequence of David&rsquo;s acting out his own dark side was
rebellion, mass murder of his own people, and the enmity of his own
children.&nbsp; The final years of David&rsquo;s rule were years of
tragedy (13:1-22; 14:1-24- 16:1-14; 18:1-33; 20:1-22) &ndash; because
he had unwittingly built a city of Satan as well as a city of God, of
political systems of lust and power as well as justice, economic
systems of greed as well as sharing, religious systems of control and
domination as well as of dynamic relationship with God.&nbsp; Thus,
David, and David&rsquo;s reign was as much &ldquo;Urushalim&rdquo; as
it was &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo;!&nbsp;</P>

The statement, &ldquo;It was you who led out Israel and brought it
in&rdquo; was actually a reference to David&rsquo;s military power.&nbsp;

brought them back in victory.&nbsp; David never lost a battle against

	There are a number of names given to this city before the time of

	It is often asserted that the name, Jerusalem, should be read as
	&ldquo;city of peace&rdquo; or &ldquo;shalom&rdquo;.&nbsp; Is there
	a relationship between the Hebrew, &ldquo;shalem&rdquo; and
	&ldquo;shalom&rdquo;?&nbsp; Apparently there is.&nbsp; In the
	Canaanite language, the god&rsquo;s name Shalem, actually meant
	&ldquo;completion&rdquo;.&nbsp; This meaning evolved from the
	Canaanites&rsquo; perception of Shalem as Venus, the evening star &ndash;
	which &ldquo;completed&rdquo; the day.&nbsp; Therefore, as time went
	on and language evolved, the word shalem came to be identified with
	a place &ndash; Jeru-shalem &ndash; and thus with the concept of
	&ldquo;completion&rdquo;, &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; or &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.&nbsp;
	This became the base for the later Israelite word shalom or

In Jewish mystical thinking of the first century in the Common Era,
there were three heavens.&nbsp; The &ldquo;first heaven&rdquo; was
the atmosphere of birds and clouds.&nbsp; The &ldquo;second heaven&rdquo;
was the firmament of the stars that the ancients saw as a sort of
&ldquo;cap&rdquo; or arch over the world upon which the stars and
planets were fixed.&nbsp; The &ldquo;third heaven&rdquo; was the
abode of God, heaven itself that lay behind the arch of the
firmament.&nbsp; Thus, when Paul refers in II Cor. 12:2 to having
been &ldquo;caught up to the third heaven&rdquo;, he is stating that
he had a vision in which God took him to heaven where he could
experience its fullness without having to die.&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></P>

He is publicly anointed to rule over Judah by the council of tribal
heads. Meanwhile, in the north, Abner, once Saul&rsquo;s military
commander, makes Ishbaal, Saul&rsquo;s son, puppet king over the
northern tribes (see <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+2%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">2:8</A>).
Both tribal coalitions plan to annex Gibeon, northwest of Jerusalem.
They try to settle the dispute by a tournament, but when this attempt

lost cause, switches to David&rsquo;s side (see <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+3%3A1-10" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">3:1-10</A>).

Ishbaal&rsquo;s courage fails and he is murdered by two of his own,
who are then killed on David&rsquo;s orders, for killing &ldquo;a

<P>Now, there being no acceptable successor to Saul, the &ldquo;tribes

anoint him king over them too; the states are thus joined in one
person. David now conquers a city belonging to neither, and makes it

match, but David&rsquo;s army prevails: Canaanite power is removed;
Jerusalem becomes &ldquo;the city of David&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Samuel+5%3A9" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">9</A>).

<P><B>John Shearman:
http://seemslikegod.org/lectionary/archives/fifth-sunday-after-pentecost-july-5-2009</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The first part of this passage is one
version of the tradition of how David became king of Israel. It comes
from the Deuteronomic editors who viewed David as the supreme
commander of all Israel&rsquo;s army. This agrees with 1 Samuel 18:5,
but not 1 Samuel 18:13. Traces of an earlier source is found is vs. 3
where it is only representative elders of the tribes rather than &ldquo;all
the tribes&rdquo; (vs. 1) who gather at Hebron to covenant with David
and anoint him king. This narrative makes the point that as a
successful military leader, he was the people&rsquo;s choice as well
the as divinely anointed sovereign.</P>
<P>Vss.4-5 also give the standard Deuteronomic formula for successive
monarchs of Israel. It tells us the duration of his reign which is
now calculated as spanning the year 1000 BCE. David first established
Hebron as his capital; then he captured the fortress of Jerusalem and
made it his capital city. The intervening verses between the two
segments of the reading are confusing due to a corrupt Hebrew text.
The narrator obviously knew much more about the lay of the land than
we are now able to determine from the most advanced archeological
data. Scholars still debate how much we can depend on the
geographical and historical validity of much of the biblical
narrative.</P>
<P>The intent of the Deuteronomic editors of this passage was to tell
their generation of Israelites of the utmost significance of David&rsquo;s
reign and especially his relocation of the capital city to Jerusalem.
They wrote during the Babylonian exile about 550 BCE when the holy
city had very special significance for the nation&rsquo;s religious
tradition. They sought to justify to the exiles in Babylon why their
captivity was the judgment of Yahweh, but also that their hope lay in
the greatness of David&rsquo;s reign as the sign of Yahweh&rsquo;s
eternal covenant with Israel.</P>
<P>The stronghold of Zion (vs. 7) was indeed a fortress situated on
the southern ridge between the valleys of Tyropoen and the Kidron
brook. It later included the whole of the fortifications of
Jerusalem. The name Zion subsequently became associated with the
sacred site of the temple built by David&rsquo;s son, Solomon. In
religious parlance, it became known as the dwelling place of Yahweh,
as evidenced by the numerous reference in the Psalms. Today, it is
occupied by two great mosques of Islam, Al Aqsa and the Dome of the
Rock.</P>
<P>The reference to &ldquo;the Millo&rdquo; in vs. 9 is obscure, but
may indicate a particular element of the fortifications which David
built. I Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27 attribute its construction to Solomon.
The word suggests a place of stamped earth. It may have been a very
secure house or perhaps a military barracks and parade ground for
gathering the city&rsquo;s defensive forces.</P>

Psalm!&nbsp; It is a tribute to Jerusalem (see the Old Testament
lesson above) and to God&rsquo;s actions in protecting and making it
his own!</B></I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The &ldquo;urban dwellers 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Psalm&rdquo;
begins by reminding us that God is found primarily in <I><B>the </B></I>city
&ndash; Jerusalem.&nbsp; God is &ldquo;most worthy of praise, in the
city of our God&rdquo; (vs. 1).&nbsp; God&rsquo;s presence in the
city makes it &ldquo;beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole
earth,&rdquo; this &ldquo;city of the Great King&rdquo; (and &ldquo;the
Great King&rdquo; is a reference to Yahweh, not to David) (v. 2)!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Why is Jerusalem to be celebrated as the abode of
God?&nbsp; It is because &ldquo;God is in her citadels; he has shown
himself to be her fortress&rdquo; (v. 3).&nbsp; God became
Jerusalem&rsquo;s fortress when Israel&rsquo;s political order
learned to trust God rather than its own defense.&nbsp; God defeated
an enemy whom Israel&rsquo;s army could not defeat.&nbsp; God, this
passage is stating, can enter into the political process and
transform it.&nbsp; God can change the premises and the actions of
the political order and can &ldquo;convert&rdquo; it from defense to
acceptance and trust.&nbsp; Even in such a pragmatic science as
politics, God can act as Savior and Lord &ndash; if people allow him
to do so.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What was the event about which the psalmist is here
writing?&nbsp; What was the occurrence that caused Israel to put such
trust in God?&nbsp; We do not know!&nbsp; The second section of this
psalm &ndash; verses 4-7 &ndash; gives us only the vaguest of hints.&nbsp;
It could have been the unsuccessful campaign of Syria and Israel
against Ahaz, king of Judah, in 735 BCE (II Kings 16:5-6).&nbsp;
Alternatively, it could have been the famed siege of Jerusalem by
Sennacherib of Assyria, recorded in both II Kings 19 and Isaiah
36-37.&nbsp; Or it could even have been a third event with which we
are not familiar.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But whichever event it was, the point of this psalm
is that God acted at a moment of grave national threat to protect
Jerusalem in the midst of its vulnerability.&nbsp; That protection
affirmed what Israel had long proclaimed &ndash; that God protected
the city in which Yahweh dwelled.&nbsp; There is something deeply
thrilling about the way verse 8 is translated in the Jerusalem Bible:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;What we had heard we saw for ourselves in the
city of our God, the city of Yahweh Sabaoth, God-protected forever&rdquo;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The people singing this psalm give witness to a
crucial faith-step that they are taking together.&nbsp; Each of them
had heard all their lives that God protects their city.&nbsp; Well,
now they have seen it with their own eyes!&nbsp; Now they have seen
that assurance in action!&nbsp; What was at one time a step of faith
had now become a step of sight!&nbsp; They saw God in action!&nbsp;
They saw God do what none of them or all of them together could do.&nbsp;
The children of Israel have experienced for themselves what they have
always been taught: that God loves the city, protects it, and invests
himself in its future.&nbsp; We can believe that truth as well &ndash;
and be open and perceptive to experience it for ourselves!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The third section of Psalm 48 begins with a prayer
of thanksgiving for God&rsquo;s defense of the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,
in your Temple we reflect on your love; God, your praise, like your
name, reaches to the ends of the world.&nbsp; Your right hand holds
the victory; Mount Zion rejoices, the daughters of Judah exult to
have your rulings&rdquo; (vss. 9-11).&nbsp; The reputation of God&rsquo;s
love for and commitment to his city, the psalmist writes, has gone to
the very ends of the earth.&nbsp; Not only God&rsquo;s people, but
even those in the suburbs and towns around Jerusalem, in fact even
those who are the despisers of God around the world and the nations
that reject his authority must admit God&rsquo;s commitment to the
city!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But then the psalm moves in a most unpredictable and
striking direction.&nbsp; One expects that the psalmist would now
launch into a celebration of God&rsquo;s power and love.&nbsp; But he
does not!&nbsp; Instead, he begins to celebrate not God &ndash; but
the city itself!&nbsp; The psalmist writes,</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;Go through Zion, walk around her. Count her
towers, admire her towers, review her palaces, that you may tell of
them to the next generation&rdquo; (vv. 12-13).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I can envision the psalmist walking &ndash; perhaps
even skipping &ndash; down Jerusalem&rsquo;s streets, effusively
pointing first with one hand and then the other as he directs the
eyes of the people he escorts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look over there,&rdquo;
he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at that magnificent building &ndash; its
height, the detail of its stone work, the exquisitely carved
doorway!&nbsp; And look, look on the other side of the street.&nbsp;
Note that enormous wall &ndash; one hundred and twenty feet high it
is!&nbsp; And it is anchored on bedrock twelve feet below!&nbsp; And
notice the enclosed bridge that arches over the street and connects
the wall with the building!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that a truly beautiful
and symmetrical arch?&nbsp; And as we pass the arch, look to your
left between the two buildings.&nbsp; Do you now see the little
courtyard nestled between them?&nbsp; Look at its inviting fountain
and the shade of its trees.&nbsp; Just imagine sitting there in the
cool of the afternoon, shielded from the noise of the street and the
burning of the sun, and quietly reading the Torah.&nbsp; <I><B>God
made all that!</B></I>&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<I><B>God made all that!&rdquo;</B></I>&nbsp;
How would we feel about our city if we began walking its streets,
admiring its buildings, and reviewing its exquisite architecture?&nbsp;
And what a difference it would make if we could begin viewing our
city, not through eyes that saw only its dirt and deprivation, but
through eyes that could recognize the handiwork of the Creator.&nbsp;
God created the city even as he created the mountains and hills and
trees and brooks.&nbsp; In the countryside God has used the forces of
nature to carve and shape and mold.&nbsp; In the city, God has used
the creativity of human beings to carve and shape and mold!&nbsp; The
city is to be celebrated and admired, not simply for itself, but
because the city is the creation and primary abode of God.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>For the reality of the Old Testament is that God is
not found in the countryside &ndash; in the hills, the rivers, the
grass, the lakes.&nbsp; The countryside was the site of the &ldquo;high
places&rdquo; &ndash; the gathering places for the worship of Ba&rsquo;al
and Shalem, the natural &ldquo;temples&rdquo; of cult prostitution
(Lev. 26:30; Num. 33:52; Deut. 33:29; I Kings 12:31; 13:32; II Kings
17:32; 23:9; Psalm 78:58).&nbsp; Yahweh was found in his capital city
of Jerusalem and in his &ldquo;palace&rdquo;, the Temple!&nbsp; The
city is the creation and primary abode of God!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>As Psalm 48 nears its end, the Jerusalem Bible
translates its closing sentence in a way that I find particularly
meaningful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell the next generation that God is here,
our God and leader forever and ever&rdquo; (v. 14)!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;Tell the next generation that God is here&rdquo;!&nbsp;
This is the psalmist&rsquo;s instruction to God&rsquo;s people;
celebrate the city in order to keep reminding its occupants that this
is a city of God, that God is here &ldquo;forever and ever&rdquo;.&nbsp;
It is precisely because the church has failed over the centuries to
&ldquo;tell the next generation that God is here&rdquo; that God&rsquo;s
people have come to emphasize what is dark and evil about the city
and have missed the concrete truth that God is there!&nbsp; Many of
the church have fled the city to the more &ldquo;conducive&rdquo;
climes of suburb and countryside, seeking God in woods and mountains
and peaceful places specifically forbidden by the Old Testament!&nbsp;
As a result, the church has unconsciously moved in a pantheistic
direction and has largely abandoned God&rsquo;s primary abode -- the
city.&nbsp; The issue is not that God has abandoned the Jerusalems of
the world as much as it is that God&rsquo;s people have abandoned the
cities and have taken their household gods with them.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If we have eyes to see, we can still look around our
city and there &ldquo;count her towers, admire her walls, review her
palaces&rdquo; and discover that what we have heard we now see for
ourselves &ndash; that &ldquo;this God is our God forever and ever;
he will be our guide even to the end&rdquo; (Psalm 48:14)!&nbsp;&nbsp;

http://seemslikegod.org/lectionary/archives/fifth-sunday-after-pentecost-july-5-2009</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">In the century after their return from
exile in Babylon in 539 BCE, the Jews sought to recover their
national identity by rebuilding their temple and their capital city
of Jerusalem. The monarchy had ceased to exist, but the temple
priesthood replaced royalty as the most prominent leaders of the
people. Out of this restored religious culture arose a fundamentally
theocratic system which flowered in the elaboration of the cultus of
temple sacrifices, the creation of psalmody and other religious
literature which subsequently became the canon of scripture. This
highly nationalistic psalm praising Jerusalem as the holy city of
Yahweh is part of that renaissance.</P>
<P>Believed to be from a collection of &ldquo;Songs of Zion,&rdquo;
it may well have been sung by pilgrims who came to Jerusalem for the
sacred festivals. Many Jews, especially those of the Diaspora, could
only afford to make this pilgrimage once in a lifetime. Every stone
and handful of dust from the city would be sacred to them. Pilgrims
today still return from Jerusalem with souvenirs of all kinds, the
more valuable if they are part of the urban fabric rather than
commercial trinkets.</P>
<P>The theme of this psalm is Yahweh&rsquo;s protection for the city
itself. It is &ldquo;his holy mountain&rdquo; (vs. 2). The second
part of that parallelism likens Mount Zion to a mountain in the far
north, possibly Mount Hermon, which reaches to heaven. There follows
a rewriting of history in vss. 4-8. Israel had suffered from many
foreign invasions. Her enemies had all perished but Jerusalem had
remained. With poetic hyperbole, the fear and panic of those enemies
is ridiculed &ldquo;as a woman in travail.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The psalmist was undoubtedly a male who had little regard for the
subject of his simile. He drew another derogatory image from the
violent storms that drove ships from the eastern Mediterranean bound
for the Phoenician port of Tartessus in Spain (Tarshish), frequently
wrecking them with its violent east wind (vs. 7). Amidst all this
terror, Jerusalem remained safe, at least in the imagination of the
poet.</P>
<P>Worshiping in the temple, strolling through the streets, or
marveling at the city&rsquo;s fortification brings to mind why this
Jerusalem is so secure: Yahweh loves Israel. There can be only one
response to this insight: praise for Israel&rsquo;s protector.</P>
<P>Despite having been destroyed and rebuilt several times, Jerusalem
still retains the designation of &ldquo;the holy city&rdquo; for
three great religious traditions &ndash; Judaism, Christianity and
Islam &ndash; all for different reasons.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Being a prophet is never easy. The
name of this prophet means &ldquo;Yahweh strengthens.&rdquo; And that
about says it all about this man of whom very little is known except
what is found in 1:3 that he was of priestly heritage and may have
deported with the rest of the exiles to Babylon in 598/597 BCE after
the surrender of King Jehoiachin. Scholars debate whether he was
actually among the exiles in Babylon or remained in Jerusalem.
According to 29:17 he was still receiving divine revelations as late
as 571 BCE.</P>
<P>The call of Ezekiel to be prophet among the exiles in Babylon
included a strong warning that he would encounter much resistance.
People in deep mourning would likely react negatively to an
encouraging message that intended to transform their ancient
traditions as did Ezekiel. In spite of their rebellion against God
and their impudent and stubborn nature, he was to deliver an
outspoken message directly from God, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Note however that his mandate came directly from Yahweh&rsquo;s
Spirit (vs. 2). This form of revelation is repeated many times in the
rest of the book (3:12, 14, 24; 11:1, 5, 24; 37:1; 43:5). In short,
Ezekiel was commanded to challenge the faith of the exiles in the God
who intended only to move them into an entirely new phase of their
religious, social, economic and political history. Doesn&rsquo;t that
sound familiar for times such as these?</P>

<P><B>Assumed to be for pilgrims approaching the temple this &ldquo;psalm
of ascent&rdquo; saw it as representing the very presence of the
invisible God among God&rsquo;s people. That brought considerable
relief from the contempt and scorn of unbelievers who felt no need
for God in their lives.</B></P>
<P>Without doubt, the temple when seen from the Mount of Olives would
have been an awesome experience for the weary pilgrim. We should
note, however, that the psalm makes no mention whatever of the
temple. The prayer could have been uttered in any place where the
supplicant looked toward the sky and imagined God seated on a throne
as the master of a household with a company of servants gathered
around him.</P>
<P>The strong emotions of the latter verses suggest the time of the
exile when the Jews were treated contemptuously by their neighbours
who felt superior to them. This gives us some insight into the
personal feelings of Jews subjected to anti-Semitism. Powerless to
fight back as in recent times when Israel withstood every assault
from hostile neighbours, they could only turn to prayer to avert the
pain such attacks inevitably imposed. One hears the same note of
despondency in those survivors of the Holocaust remembering the time
when six million Jews were left to suffer at the hands of the Nazis.</P>

(12:2), where he observed things unimaginable to humanity, &ldquo;heard
things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to
repeat&rdquo; (vs. 4).&nbsp; He says nothing more about this
experience &ndash; simply that he had the experience.&nbsp; But the
purpose of this mystical experience was to confirm to Paul that the
directions of his ministry and the priorities that he was insisting
upon were of God, and therefore were right.&nbsp; Consequently, this
meant that Paul was not going to be easily dissuaded from maintaining
these directions and priorities, no matter what arguments were placed
before him or what power plays were conducted.&nbsp; He had been
shown by God the rightness of the intent of his mission, and he was
not to be convinced otherwise!</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Paul then goes on to say that, in order &ldquo;to
keep from being too elated (by this experience), a thorn was given to
me in the flesh&rdquo; (vs. 7).&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know what that
&ldquo;thorn&rdquo; might have been, but there are intriguing clues.&nbsp;
Paul&rsquo;s thorn in the flesh could have been an illness or
disability of some sort or it could have been the grief brought to
him by many of his churches or from Jewish-Christian opposition.&nbsp;
He never states what the thorn is (although he alludes in 10:1-10 to
a kind of ailment that either made him appear repulsive to others or
which affected his speaking).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Whatever that thorn might have been, what was
important was not the identification of the thorn itself, but how
Paul chose to respond to it.&nbsp; He wrote in today&rsquo;s epistle
lesson, &ldquo;Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it
would leave me, but he said to me, &lsquo;my grace is sufficient for
you, for power is made perfect in weakness&rsquo; (12:8)&rdquo;.&nbsp;
What God&rsquo;s words said to Paul is that not all suffering is
meant to be removed nor all difficulties meant to be resolved.&nbsp;
Some of the tragedies with which we must cope, whether short-term or
life-long, enables us to know the divine strength that can be at work
even in human weakness.&nbsp; But to access that strength requires us
to surrender our need for resolution and relief.&nbsp; God will work
through Paul and accomplish His purposes in spite of a &ldquo;thorn&rdquo;
that might remain.&nbsp; In fact, that &ldquo;thorn&rdquo; may create
a level of dependence upon and trust in God in the way that good
health or good fortune will not.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;grace
that is sufficient for you&rdquo; as God builds the power we exercise
through our vulnerability and weakness.&nbsp; Despite our human
weakness, God&rsquo;s grace will accomplish God&rsquo;s purposes in
and through us and will consequently enable us to impact the world as
it is, even when we are surrounded by our own inadequacies and
vulnerabilities.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thus it is that Paul concludes this scripture lesson
with the lesson he has learned from the thorn in his life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships,
persecutions and calamities for the sake of Christ &ndash; <I>for
whenever I am weak, then I am strong</I>&rdquo; (12:10)!&nbsp; The
power of God at work in our lives and through our actions, that power
that gives us the capacity, ability and willingness to act for Christ
and His Kingdom, comes out of our vulnerability, our pain, our heart
broken over those things that break God&rsquo;s heart in our
heartless world.&nbsp; For when we are weak, then God is strong
through us and, consequently, then we are strong!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In Jewish mystical thinking of the first century in the Common Era,
there were three heavens.&nbsp; The &ldquo;first heaven&rdquo; was
the atmosphere of birds and clouds.&nbsp; The &ldquo;second heaven&rdquo;
was the firmament of the stars that the ancients saw as a sort of
&ldquo;cap&rdquo; or arch over the world upon which the stars and
planets were fixed.&nbsp; The &ldquo;third heaven&rdquo; was the
abode of God, heaven itself that lay behind the arch of the
firmament.&nbsp; Thus, when Paul refers in II Cor. 12:2 to having
been &ldquo;caught up to the third heaven&rdquo;, he is stating that
he had a vision in which God took him to heaven where he could
experience its fullness without having to die.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></FONT>

keeps me from &ldquo;being too elated&rdquo;: a chronic condition, a
physical or mental disability, a recurring illness &ndash; or
opposition of one or more people. (&ldquo;Satan&rdquo; was thought
responsible for disease as well as sin.) At one time, I repeatedly
&ldquo;appealed to the Lord&rdquo; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=2Corinthians+12%3A8" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '; return true">8</A>)

http://seemslikegod.org/lectionary/archives/fifth-sunday-after-pentecost-july-5-2009</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">In the midst of a conflict with the
Corinthian Christian community, Paul tells about two of his deepest
spiritual experiences. In one he had an ecstatic theophany when he
received an exceptional revelation. He does not say exactly what the
revelation was. Perhaps it was beyond words, as such experiences
often are.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">S</SPAN>uch religious ecstasy
brings forth negative attitudes and criticisms in our intellectually
sophisticated age. We should neither spurn them nor invent
opportunities to create moments such as Paul describes. They can be
very real, however or to whom they occur. It may well be that certain
people, like Paul and innumerable other saints in the history of the
church, have a special gift for or are particularly susceptible to
such experiences. There is some recent psycho-neurological research
that certain neurological structures of the brain make intense
religious experiences not only possible but likely. (See <EM>The
Global Spiral</EM>, monthly online publication of the Metanexus
Institute.)<BR>Bruce Chilton adds to the scholarly uncertainty about
these experiences in his <EM>Rabbi Paul: An Intellectual Biography</EM>.
(Doubleday, 2000) He believes that Paul, like Jesus and Peter before
him, shared in what later became known as the Merkabah tradition. Jey
J.Kanagaraj (<EM>Mysticism&rsquo; in the Gospel of John: An Inquiry
into its Background</EM>. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998)
discussed the Merkabah tradition in positing the theory that &ldquo;the
Gospel John is a &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; document, written, at least
as one of its purposes, to address with the Gospel those who were
preoccupied with Merkabah mystical practice and with cosmological
speculations.&rdquo; It is known that from the 2nd to the 7th
centuries CE, Jewish mystics were inspired and guided by the mystical
visions of Ezekiel and the divine chariot (Ezekiel 1) to experience
direct, personal communion with God.</P>
<P>Modern psychology, psychiatry and neurology have attempted to
describe how these mystical experience do happen. One of the best
analyses was written nearly fifty years ago by a British
psychiatrist, William Sargent, in his book <EM>Battle For The Mind</EM>.
Sargent showed that physiological similarities exist between
religious ecstasy and conversion, healing for shell-shocked and
battle-fatigued war veterans, forced criminal confessions, and
politically motivated brain-washing. He might also add the behavioral
compulsions of teenagers in response to their favorite rock stars.</P>
<P>In the other spiritual experience described in this passage, Paul
tells how he fervently prayed to have the unidentified cause of great
suffering removed. Instead he was given the reassurance that God&rsquo;s
grace would be sufficient for his every need. Much speculation has
been expended as to the exact nature of Paul&rsquo;s problem. These
vary from a painful and incurable disease, a physical disability due
to paralysis, a facial disfigurement or poor eyesight, all the way to
a tendency to homosexuality. Chilton adds to the speculation by
proposing that because he was under such constant stress from the
time of his conversion onward, he was subject to frequent attacks of
shingles (<EM>herpes zoster</EM>) that left him disfigured. The fact
is that we can never know for sure. More important, however, is the
way he deals with his &ldquo;thorn in the flesh.&rdquo; It became a
source of power in that it made possible a deeper spiritual
experience enabling him to withstand ever greater hardship in
pursuing his mission as an evangelist.</P>
<P>Many ministers can attest to the reality that when they feel most
incapable of making an effective witness to faith, others have
greatly benefited from their perceived failures. One minister invited
to preach in a prominent New York church felt he had utterly ruined
the opportunity. Retiring to the vestry after the service, his eye
fell on a wall plague bearing the words, &ldquo;Hallelujah anyway!
God is with us.&rdquo;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><U>Mark
6:1-13</U> is the story of the response to Jesus by his townspeople
and a subsequent response to his disciples.&nbsp; In the first
account, Jesus is rejected by the people of Nazareth; the scripture
tells us that &ldquo;they took offense at him&rdquo; (6:3b).&nbsp;
Their statement in response to Jesus&rsquo; teaching is particularly
telling:&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did this man get all this?&nbsp; What is
this wisdom that has been given to him?&nbsp; What deeds of power are
being done by his hands?&nbsp; Is not this the carpenter, the son of
Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not
his sisters here with us?&rdquo; (vv. 2b-3)&nbsp; In other words,
they are saying, &ldquo;Who does this man think he is?&nbsp; We have
known him all his life.&nbsp; He grew up here.&nbsp; We know his
family.&nbsp; And we know he is nothing more than a common laborer
who has neither formal religious training nor academic credentials.&nbsp;
And now he thinks he can teach us?&nbsp; Who does he think he is
anyway?&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, they are insulted by his attempt
to teach them.&nbsp; At least as far as this prophet is concerned,
familiarity bred contempt, not a willingness to listen and learn (vs.
4)! </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is noteworthy that this rejection is not limited
to Jesus&rsquo; fellow townspeople.&nbsp; Even his family and his
wider circle of relatives (&ldquo;one&rsquo;s own kin and one&rsquo;s
own household&rdquo; &ndash; vs. 4) reject him and his testimony.&nbsp;
Not even his own family will give him the benefit of the doubt!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This rejection greatly hurts Jesus.&nbsp; Mark tells
us &ldquo;he could do no deed of power there&rdquo; and &ldquo;was
amazed at their unbelief&rdquo; (vss. 5, 6).&nbsp; This blatant
rejection hinders Jesus&rsquo; ability to do deeds of power among
them; at the most, he can only &ldquo;lay his hands on a few sick
people and cure them&rdquo; (vs. 5b).&nbsp; The participation by the
people in such great works through the exercise of their faith is
strategic to Jesus&rsquo; effectiveness to transform situations; the
people are not observers, but participants!&nbsp; So their rejection
of Jesus results in their own rejection of what he is capable of
doing in their midst!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The response to the disciples in another venue is
strikingly different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark tells us that Jesus sent them
out &ldquo;two by two among the villages&rdquo; of Galilee.&nbsp;
There, they healed the sick, cast out demons and taught the word.&nbsp;
Jesus instructed them &ldquo;to take nothing for their journey except
a staff&rdquo;, to bless every house with shalom into which they were
invited, and to &ldquo;shake off the dust that is on your feet&rdquo;
to any village or house that rejected them.&nbsp; And the text tells
us, &ldquo;So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.&nbsp;
They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick
and cured them&rdquo; (vss. 12-13).&nbsp; So the disciples were
enabled to do many good works because the populace was open to them,
received them enthusiastically, and had faith in the work of
transformation they had come to do!&nbsp; They were, therefore, the
exact opposite of the people of Nazareth.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Mark is seeking to present in these two parallel
stories more than simply receptivity or rejection of Christ.&nbsp;
What he is communicating is that all of Jesus&rsquo; ministry up to
this point (1:1&mdash;5:43) had been one both of calling the
political-economic-religious system of Israel and its leaders to
accountability and beginning the creation of an alternate community
of shalom to that system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is, essentially,
challenging the status quo of Israel, making powerful enemies, and
working to create a new order (the &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo;) that
would be in opposition to Israel&rsquo;s systems.&nbsp; He is
therefore extremely revolutionary &ndash; even radical, and
identification with him is consequently dangerous.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jesus&rsquo; ministry, in particular, scandalized
the people of his neighborhood; it upset the status quo.&nbsp; His
very association with them as a &ldquo;son&rdquo; of Nazareth
threatened not only the citizens of Nazareth, but his extended
family, as well.&nbsp; They were afraid that they would become
tainted by his actions, that the principalities and powers would
conclude that Jesus came out of a revolutionary atmosphere in
Nazareth and might seek to crush that spirit.&nbsp; The people were
threatened by Jesus&rsquo; ministry.&nbsp; And so they sought ways to
dismiss him &ndash; time-honored ways for dismissing the impact of a
man.&nbsp; They belittled his lack of formal education.&nbsp; They
made light of his occupation as a carpenter.&nbsp; They criticized
his family as being a family of little consequence in their city.&nbsp;
They avoided him and would not believe in him.&nbsp; And their
attitude was sure to limit his effectiveness in ministering in his
hometown.&nbsp; The people of Nazareth were intimidated by Jesus and
the controversy he had stirred up.&nbsp; And so they sought to
distance themselves from him as much as possible.&nbsp; And that
distancing included not only the townspeople, but his relatives and
his own maternal household, as well!</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thus, Jesus must create a new household, a new
kinship system, a new family.&nbsp; Recognizing that he is now a
disowned &quot;prophet without honor&rdquo;, Jesus withdraws from the
close familial and neighborhood ties of the past to begin in earnest
the creation of a new community, a new family in God, and a new
political-economic-religious order (the &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo;).&nbsp;
And he recognizes that this new order can only be built among
strangers!&nbsp; Thus, he sends forth his disciples two-by-two to
discover that potential community among those whom they meet or heal
or teach or stay in their homes across all of Galilee.&nbsp; And
among those former strangers, Jesus will build his alternative
community to that of Israel, a community with all of its conflicts,
its tragedies as well as victories, its struggle to understand and
embrace the mission to which Jesus calls it.&nbsp; He and they go out
with &ldquo;no bread, no bag, no money in their belts&rdquo; to build
together the shalom community in the midst of a Yahweh-aware society
that rejects all that Yahweh was about because of their fear of the
dominating &ldquo;principalities and powers&rdquo; of their world.&nbsp;

<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">To say the least, Jesus&rsquo;
hometown folk felt uneasy with him in their midst, especially when he
taught in their synagogue on a sabbath. We are not told why they were
so offended. Perhaps it was just their jealousy that one whom they
knew so well had become so famous. Certainly they thought he had far
gone beyond what one of his status as a humble carpenter should go.
They would have had respect for him as one skilled in such trades as
carpentry that contributed to the general welfare of the community.
But they would not have expected him to be skilled in the
interpretation of the scriptures or a radical social reformer. One of
the contemporary group of Jesus scholars has speculated that although
verbally gifted in a predominately oral culture, Jesus may have been
illiterate.</P>
<P>Rejected at home, Jesus adopted another strategy. He gathered his
disciples together and sent them out &ldquo;with authority over the
unclean spirits.&rdquo; This may have meant that they merely had
power to change people&rsquo;s minds about what they might expect
from Jesus. The gospel authors like Mark who wrote down the tradition
for subsequent generations also believed that the disciples possessed
the same authority over unclean spirits that Jesus himself had
demonstrated. Apparently that is what Mark intended. But was this
&ldquo;authority&rdquo; (Greek = <EM>exousia</EM>) a moral and
spiritual authority of a pastoral nature or was it something more of
a power to effect physical cures? Without question then as now,
anyone suffering from an illness, however caused, would seriously
affect everyone in the extended family or the immediate community of
the sick person. In such circumstances, even death has a healing
effect over time.</P>
<P>There is an interesting analysis by John Dominic Crossan of the
differentiation between the actual events in Galilee when Jesus lived
there during the late third decade of the lst century and the way the
story was told by Mark in the seventh decade. Crossan believes that
the Markan account described a difference of approach between those
who were itinerant apostles and those who were resident followers of
the Way. This occurred in the later period when the apostolic church
was spreading out into the Gentile world. He elaborates this thesis
in his essay &ldquo;Jesus And The Kingdom&rdquo; in the volume edited
by Marcus Borg, <EM>Jesus At 2000</EM>. (Westview Press, 1998). He
concludes that this passage is Mark&rsquo;s own description of the
kingdom as &ldquo;companionship of empowerment&rdquo; rather than the
actual historical events of Jesus&rsquo; ministry. This is in
keeping, Crossan claims, with Jesus&rsquo; inauguration of the
kingdom as an &ldquo;interactive social radicalism&rdquo; consisting
of two distinct elements: those who were itinerant preachers of a
radical gospel and those who were resident householders who witnessed
to it less radically in their normal community living.</P>
<P>The end of the story as we now have it in this passage revealed
how successful they were in calling people to repent, casting out
demons and curing the sick. This appears to have been a trial run for
the post-Pentecost period when Mark was an active itinerant with Paul
and Barnabas, at least for while before accompanying Peter to Rome.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=2>Last Sunday,
the Old Testament reading (2 Samuel 1:1, 17-27) presented one episode
in the story of King David and his rise to the throne of Israel, and
the story continues in this week's reading from 2 Samuel. This week's
Old and New Testament texts both offer us an opportunity to think
about leadership and the way God calls and works through individual
people. In both readings, we have, in a sense, a &quot;Tale of Two
Crowds,&quot; the people who accept David as their king, and the
folks in Nazareth who couldn't take Jesus seriously as a great
spiritual leader.<BR><BR>The Second Samuel reading may suggest that
David was the overwhelming, unquestioned choice of all the people, in
the North and the South, and his rise to the throne may seem like a
straight line from the time of his anointing by Samuel many years
before. That would be a misunderstanding caused by our lectionary
which by necessity takes small pieces of the grand narrative of the
Bible and creates &quot;snapshots&quot; instead of long-running
television series or thick novels rich in detail and context. In a
lectionary reading, we often miss helpful background material and the
larger story.<BR><BR>In fact, the story has not been a pretty one,
and blood has been shed repeatedly along the way. There have been
division, betrayal, war, and not everyone agrees that there should
even be a king over all Israel. In the end, David is acknowledged as
God's choice and is remembered as having led Israel effectively even
while Saul was still alive. Perhaps the most important line is the
last, in which David grows &quot;greater and greater, for the Lord,
the God of hosts, was with him.&quot; Whatever path brought David to
power, and whatever mistakes he would make as king, it is the power
of God that gave him charisma, intelligence, and grace, and made him
the enduring symbol of Israel's deep hopes in every generation.<BR><BR>On
the other hand, the power of God at work in Jesus, in the Gospel
reading from Mark, is not something the people of his hometown of
Nazareth could wrap their minds around. He's just returned from a
road trip, a fairly successful tour in the area surrounding his
hometown, and they've undoubtedly heard about the spectacular things
he's been doing. That sort of news travels fast. We wonder, however,
if word of healings, and demons driven out, and the life of a little
girl restored, travels better than the Word that Jesus preaches. Of
course, everyone wants to see miracles, but does everyone want to
hear about the life-changing but perhaps unsettling good news that
those miracles illustrate and announce?<BR><BR><STRONG>An &quot;iPod&quot;
theology</STRONG><BR><BR>And does anyone really want to listen to a
hometown boy, especially one whose parentage is questionable (&quot;son
of Mary&quot; instead of &quot;son of Joseph&quot;), and &quot;just&quot;
an artisan at that? (How could he possibly have the learning needed
to preach to us?) And yet he does what men did in those days, in the
synagogue on the sabbath, opening the Scriptures and teaching those
gathered, and he does so with great authority. Richard Swanson sees
their reaction in a slightly different light than pure disapproval,
calling their arguments &quot;exactly the sort of faithful response
one should expect in a faith that is named 'Israel,' which means 'he
wrestles with God.' To refuse to engage the ideas, to refuse to
argue, would be a sign of serious disrespect, a failure of
faithfulness. The congregants honor Jesus with an argument.&quot;
Honor or not, the respectful wrestling quickly turns to offended
rejection, and this is the last time Mark reports a visit by Jesus to
the synagogue. Instead, Jesus takes his ministry of proclamation out
on the road, to the people, so it's no surprise that he instructs his
disciples to do the same. (The Reverend Otis Moss III, in an
interview on ucc.org, calls this &quot;iPod theology&quot;--mobile
and more effective than waiting for the people to &quot;come to
us.&quot;)<BR><BR>Jesus is as offended by the people's lack of faith,
their closed minds and hearts, as they are offended by his teachings.
While we can look back on their refusal to hear Jesus' message, or on
the disciples' painfully slow progress toward understanding it, it
might be more helpful to put ourselves in their place. Beverly
Link-Sawyer, for example, asks, &quot;What would we think about a
neighbor whom we believed to be just an ordinary, hardworking man
turning into a miraculous teacher, let alone the reputed Son of God?&quot;
Would that be something we could wrap our minds, and hearts,
around?<BR><BR><STRONG>Seeing one another as God sees us</STRONG><BR><BR>We
might spend some time examining our preconceptions about whom we
consider &quot;worthy&quot; of leading or teaching us. How do we even
begin to look at one another with the eyes of God, to see in the most
unexpected of people those whom God has chosen to lead? Would we
really have chosen the youngest one, the one out with the flocks, to
be anointed as the next king of an entire nation, the king of a
people specially chosen by God? Would we really open our hearts and
minds to a hometown, homegrown boy, someone we've known all of his
life? Could anyone of importance really come from here, from us?
Megan McKenna describes Nazareth as &quot;a backwater village where
perhaps 120 to 150 people lived at the time of Jesus,&quot; with many
of them members of Jesus' extended birth family. In the face of this
kind of rejection, is it any wonder that Jesus redefines family for
his followers? Jesus has now been rejected not only by the high and
mighty religious leaders but even by the humblest of his connections,
the people who should have known him, and loved him, best.<BR><BR>So
the townsfolk of Nazareth fail to acknowledge or recognize God at
work in a hometown boy, and recite his family history as proof that
he is just one of them, and that his teaching is a sign of
over-reaching and perhaps even arrogance. Many writers quote the
saying, &quot;Familiarity breeds contempt,&quot; which might be a
title for this section of Mark's Gospel. This crowd, rather than
acclaiming Jesus as their spiritual leader, misses out on the amazing
things God is doing in their midst. Matthew Skinner says that &quot;they
barricade themselves from the fullness of blessings that God might
have poured out in Nazareth.&quot; Jesus responds with an observation
rooted in conventional wisdom; Skinner, for example, provides a
proverb from &quot;the moral philosopher Plutarch: 'The most sensible
and wisest people are little cared for in their own hometown.'&quot;<BR><BR><STRONG>An
&quot;un-miracle story&quot;</STRONG><BR><BR>Reading that Jesus'
power was somehow limited by the people's unbelief may raise
questions in our minds. Barbara Brown Taylor employs a wonderful
metaphor in her sermon on this text to illustrate why Jesus couldn't
work the same &quot;deeds of power&quot; in his hometown, where the
people refused to respond to him. Jesus was still Jesus, she says,
and &quot;still had power to share with them, only he could not do
anything with it because they would not let him.&quot; She compares
it to the experience of trying to light a match to a pile of wet
sticks: &quot;It does not matter how strong your flame is: what you
need is something that will catch fire. So call this an 'un-miracle'
story, in which Jesus held the match until it burned out in his hand,
while his family and friends sat shaking their heads a safe distance
away.&quot; Instead of working great wonders, &quot;He dropped the
match when it burned his fingers and absolutely nothing caught fire
in the synagogue that day....he left them to go shine his light
somewhere else.&quot; Taylor then calls us &quot;the religious
people, whose religion can get in our way. We are Jesus' hometown
kin, who do not always honor him.&quot; Her sermon challenges us to
consider our discomfort with being challenged, especially by the
unexpected, unlikely people sent by God to do just that. Like the
United Church of Christ, Taylor believes that God is still speaking:
&quot;God is all around us, speaking to us through the most unlikely
people. Sometimes it is a mysterious stranger, but more often, I
suspect, it is people so familiar to us that we simply overlook
them.&quot; If we refuse to listen, &quot;then we should not be
surprised if Jesus leaves us to go shine his light somewhere else.&quot;
(Her sermon, &quot;Sapping God's Strength,&quot; is found in her
book, Bread of Angels.)<BR><BR>Speaking of leaving to go shine one's
light somewhere else: Jesus then sends out his disciples to continue
and expand his ministry and to be God's agents at work in the world,
traveling light and depending on God to provide all that they would
need. The followers of Jesus do this not by their own power or
authority, but by the authority and power Jesus has placed in them.
&quot;They are not invited,&quot; Dianne Bergant writes, &quot;they
are commissioned. They are sent out as one in authority sends out
delegates or envoys. The authority is not theirs, nor is the message.
They are merely sent in place of the other. However, it is through
their agency that the wonders are performed.&quot; The images of a
wandering prophet or a spiritual seeker do not fit this sending.
&quot;This is no rootless wandering,&quot; Richard Swanson writes,
and &quot;the disciples do not look like itinerant preachers. They
are sent out to attack demons and heal.&quot; Like Jesus and John the
Baptist before him, the disciples &quot;are sent out to call for
change.&quot; Our call, as followers of Jesus, as those sent with
power and authority (that derive from him) is to do the same: to
heal, to attack the demons that plague our society and the world that
God loves, to share the good news. Like the disciples, we are sent
into the world.<BR><BR>Jesus knows that the journey and the work will
be hard, but he sends his &quot;agents&quot; out with very little
besides the good news and each other, and a stick, perhaps for
safety, perhaps for support. We so often practice evangelism as a
ministry to bring people to church that it's an exercise to picture
ourselves taking the good news out on the road, out into our lives,
out into the world that hungers for it. If we focus too much of our
time and energy and resources on the physical plant of our church,
for example, then we might grow dependent upon it, a material
resource, a possession, in a sense, a security blanket, perhaps. It's
what we humans do when we feel insecure, after all: depend on things
instead of God. Our intentions are good, but we can depend on the
medium more than the message, the right equipment and the most
beautiful sacred objects. Jesus knows this about us, understanding
that &quot;Provisions for the journey can substitute for faith if
we're not careful,&quot; Peter W. Marty writes. Jesus &quot;just
doesn't want people disappearing beneath the weight of their
treasures when they have something as important as the good news to
live and share.&quot; In The Message, Eugene Peterson's marvelous
translation of the Bible, Jesus puts it this way: &quot;Don't think
you need a lot of extra equipment for this. You are the
equipment.&quot;<BR><BR><STRONG>&quot;SUV spirituality&quot;</STRONG><BR><BR>Henry
G. Brinton provides a delightful contemporary image for the daunting
task of evangelism in a world hungry for good news but often hostile
to it: &quot;The challenge is to practice some true 'SUV
spirituality': to serve Jesus by doing something tough, and by
performing the Lord's work in some hard-to-reach regions.&quot; For
preachers and disciples in any age, it &quot;has never been easy to
leave the comfortable road of conventional wisdom and to face the
rocks and logs and other barriers that society throws in our way.&quot;
Are we 21st century Christians willing to suffer the rejection and
dangers as much as the joys of preaching the good news?<BR><BR>Mainline
Protestants are recovering our passion for evangelism, reclaiming our
call to share the gospel in both word and deed, and making sure that
neither contradicts the other. Michael Lindvall says that &quot;the
church will not be heard if what we do as Christians is incongruous
with what we say about our faith.&quot; But we're not simply out to
get new members (not that there's anything wrong with new church
members!) in our ministry of evangelism, &quot;not 'to get them on
our side' or even 'to grow the church,' but simply to tell others
about the God who has come to mean so much to us.&quot;<BR><BR>The
work of God, even through gifted and called leaders, happens best, it
seems, when the people hear God still speaking to them in their own
place and time, in their own situation, and listen for where God is
leading them and whom God is sending to lead them. There's an
openness called for on the part of the people to listen and accept
God's gifts. Of course, leaders also need to be open to God's voice,
to be humble and led even as they lead. Is it surprising, then, that
the humble image of a shepherd is used to describe both David and
Jesus?<BR><BR></FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=2>Today, as we
observe the Independence Day season, I'd like to offer a brief
perspective on the wealth of our great nation and a reminder of the
heavy price paid for the freedoms we enjoy. <BR><BR>Two of my
favorite authors provide quotations that focus on this paradox of the
strength that comes from great sacrifice, tragedy, and pain.&nbsp;
The first is from Maya Angelou:&nbsp; &quot;History, despite its
wrenching pain, cannot be unlived but, if faced with courage, need
not be lived again.&quot;&nbsp; The other comes from Ernest
Hemingway:&nbsp; &quot;Life breaks all of us, but some of us are
strong in the broken places.&quot; <BR><BR>Strong in the broken
places.&nbsp; That is the subject of my remarks today.&nbsp; My hope
is that it will contain some small bit of encouragement for all of us
who have been visited by anxiety and loss, pain, and dread in recent
weeks and months.<BR><BR>As we progress through this Fourth of July
holiday weekend, we should recall that before the original
celebrations of independence came great suffering and self denial.&nbsp;
One hundred and fifty years before the Revolutionary War, the
pilgrims at Plymouth (1620) endured brutal winters.&nbsp; In fact,
the history books indicate that 46 of the original 102
colonists--nearly half--perished from the lack of fresh food to eat
and the inability to treat resulting diseases.&nbsp; Imagine the
grief and the quiet regret many felt at having made the decision to
journey across a wide ocean to the untamed American wilderness.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>One
historian noted that the new Americans &quot;made seven times more
graves than huts.&quot;&nbsp; Despite this, they set aside a time to
give thanks, a day that, ultimately, evolved into our modern
Thanksgiving holiday.&nbsp; Imagine that, half of the people of your
village--your subdivision, if you will--have perished in the past
year, but still, you pause to celebrate all that remained and all
that could be restored. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The Americans who dined at the
earliest Thanksgiving feasts did not live to see the Revolutionary
War that would move us from a colony to an independent republic.&nbsp;
Nor could they have imagined that our same young nation could be torn
asunder a hundred years later in a cataclysmic Civil War.&nbsp; But
soldiers in every war have paused when they could to eat and to give
thanks.<BR><BR>Think about it.&nbsp; In the 1600s, Americans fought
the elements to survive.&nbsp; During the 1700s, Americans fought the
British for their independence.&nbsp; In the 1800s, Americans fought
one another over the moral issue of slavery.&nbsp; And during the
1900s, Americans fought international powers to protect freedom in
the world. <BR><BR>In the early days of the 21st century, a divided
nation would begin the slow march toward healing and unity.&nbsp;
Hard economic times both exposed our best instincts and core values
as we shared our bounty--and our deepest fears--as some citizens
harbored hatred and prejudice based upon unchangeable, God-given
differences.&nbsp; Then, on 9/11, we were shaken to our collective
core when a fateful attack killed several thousand.&nbsp; I am proud
to say, however, that in the fashion of our forefathers and
mothers--with God as a directing force--we rallied to make sense of
and learn from that devastating day in world history.&nbsp; The odd
blessing is that millions of Americans and billions around the world
united in what Dr. King called &quot;an inescapable network of
destiny.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>In no way could a reasonable
man suggest that this tragedy was pardonable; however, it provoked
the faith-based community to reflect on God's message to God's
people.&nbsp; And there is merit in that. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>In
2 Corinthians 12, the Apostle Paul refers to a man who has seen and
experienced the third heaven.&nbsp; We now know that he made
reference to himself, though we remain ignorant of the specifics of
his experience.&nbsp; That is no accident, as Paul is following a
directive from God. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Second Corinthians is one of the
most fascinating texts in the Bible.&nbsp; Here Paul reflects on his
own brokenness, his waning ability to cope with unnamed infirmities.&nbsp;
Three times he petitioned God to relieve him of the issues that
plagued him; and three times, God reminded His servant that he had
been gifted with all he needed to cope.<BR><BR>God knows us
intimately, and He knows that, in our mortal weakness, we are prone
to exalting ourselves in times of sufficiency--and even more in times
of surplus.<BR><BR>We do not know what Paul's thorn was, but he
communicates his understanding that it is better, with God's help, to
bear our human frailties than it is to glory in our ineptitude.&nbsp;
It is in these periods of suffering that we are drawn to Him and
reminded of His promises:&nbsp; He will supply our needs; all things
will work together for good to those who are called according to His
purpose; and His grace will always be sufficient.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Over
the years, we have persevered in the long march toward national
unity.&nbsp; Surely there have been breaches of faith, but overall,
we have slowly begun to perceive the strength that is innate in our
diversity and joint humanity.&nbsp; In 1960, we elected a young,
Catholic president; and women--who had been denied the right to vote
before 1920--began to appear in Congress, the Supreme Court, and the
highest levels of government and corporate executive roles.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<BR><BR>As president of Morehouse College, I am compelled to
observe that, remarkably, just forty four years ago when the
legendary Benjamin Elijah Mays was president of Morehouse College,
most black Americans could not safely and reliably vote.&nbsp; Now,
the United States has elected another young president who happens to
be black.&nbsp; It is almost unimaginable that one nation could make
that much progress in four short decades, but...that is the American
way.</FONT></P>
<P>The nation has begun to count the cost of its freedom and consider
the invoice that will have to be paid if that same freedom is not
extended to every American citizen, as well as our brothers and
sisters around the globe.&nbsp; We have grown stronger and wiser as
we discovered untapped depth in those old-fashioned, core American
values of freedom, equality, peacemaking, and compassion for the
least advantaged members of our communities.<BR><BR>Once again, the
world stands in awe of us, or better, in awe of that wonderful,
ineffable quality we call the American spirit.&nbsp; It is a
resilient spirit.&nbsp; And it constantly surprises us with its
bottomless potential for renewal.<BR><BR>As we enjoy this
Independence Day holiday, many of our neighbors--fellow
Americans--live in misery and profound, unsettling uncertainty about
the future.&nbsp; Many of us have taken heavy financial hits in
recent months, and we are informed that chilly times are in the
future forecast.&nbsp; Many who observed July 4th last year held jobs
they thought were secure.&nbsp; Now, the ranks of the unemployed have
swollen to record levels. &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>As if that
were not enough, we are cognizant of two foreign wars where fellow
Americans are making the ultimate sacrifice. Over 4,200 have fallen
in Iraq and over 600 in Afghanistan.&nbsp; We mourn each and every
one of those precious souls; we give thanks for what they have given
to us; and we remember their families and those who continue to serve
far from home.<BR><BR>Like our predecessors, Americans today
understand disappointment and terror.&nbsp; And despite--or perhaps
because of--our difficult lessons and hard-earned wisdom, we have
been made strong in the broken places.<BR><BR>Like many of you, I
have been privileged to participate in a Jewish Passover Seder
meal--an elaborate ritual dinner held on the first night of the
Passover, an eight-day celebration that celebrates the Jewish pride
of heritage and the hope for freedom for all people.&nbsp; One of the
passages of the litany declares that we must recapture the Exodus,
and I quote:&nbsp; &quot;This great gift of freedom was given to us.&nbsp;
Let us merit what has been given us by becoming the agents of freedom
for all God's children who dwell in darkness.&quot;<BR><BR>The story
is told of a Renaissance artist who made the world's most prized
vases.&nbsp; A foreign visiting apprentice came to observe his
method.&nbsp; After laboring for many weeks with one piece of
clay--firing it, painting it, baking it--he placed it upon a pedestal
for inspection.&nbsp; The apprentice sat in awe at this thing of
unspeakable beauty.&nbsp; But it appeared that the artist was not yet
finished.&nbsp; In a shocking and dramatic moment, the artist lifted
the vase above his head and dashed it against the floor, breaking it
into a thousand shards.&nbsp; And then, quietly, he reconnected the
pieces by painting them with a paint of pure gold.&nbsp; Each crack
reflected invaluable gold. In the end, this magnificent, but
imperfect, piece became the most valued piece in the collection.<BR><BR>As
you gather with family, some at your table will feel broken.&nbsp;
They may not speak of it, but you will know it is there. Let them
know that they can become strong again.&nbsp; They can endure. <BR><BR>Let
them know of your struggles.&nbsp; But, more important, let them know
of the faith that fortified you to endure. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Let them
know that God's grace was sufficient for you and shall also be for
them.<BR><BR>And as you look into the mirror each morning and see the
slow and quiet evidence of strain and stress, of passing time and
battle fatigue begin to etch deeper, know that those are not
meaningless wrinkles but lines of character and wisdom and beauty.
<BR><BR>Life breaks all of us, yet many of us are strong in the
broken places. <BR><BR>Let us pray.<BR><BR>Gracious God, we draw
comfort and courage from the words of the hymn that tells us:</P>
<P>&quot;Life is filled with swift transitions. <BR>Naught on earth
unmoved can stand. <BR>Build your hope on things eternal. <BR>Hold to
God's unchanging hand.&quot;<BR>So, &quot;precious Lord, take our
hands, lead us on and let us stand.&quot; &nbsp;<BR>We know that no
matter how difficult our circumstances may grow, <BR>you will never
abandon us.<BR>This is our hope and our profession of faith.<BR>In
Christ's name.&nbsp; Amen.
