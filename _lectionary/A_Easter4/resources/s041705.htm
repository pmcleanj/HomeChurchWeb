</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Questions: <br>
The commentators do not agree. Is this passage from Acts, this description of 
the early Christian community, idealized or not? Does it matter? Long ago, in 
a far-off land, our ancestors in faith did the same things we do today, as communities 
of faith. At least, these are the things that we are called to do and to be about; 
these are the marks that identify us as distinctively Christian communities: devoting 
ourselves to the teaching of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, 
and to prayer. It would not be difficult to draw the parallels between then and 
now, to pull out our monthly newsletters and find here, and there, the activities 
and programs by which we too strive to devote ourselves to study, fellowship, 
the breaking of bread, and prayer. This Bible study or adult education class or 
confirmation class or church school curriculum, that coffee hour or women&#8217;s gathering 
or youth group outing or film series, this weekly communion service or that opening 
prayer, that Sunday morning service of worship, that Taizé service, that prayer 
at the side of one who is dying&#8230;these are the embodiments and expressions of our 
own, idealized, shared life in faith. <br>
<br>
What may be missing, too often, is not the teaching and learning, the fellowship, 
communion, or prayer: it may be the awe. The &#8220;wonders and signs&#8221; may be passing 
us by, without our taking notice. Perhaps it is one of the tasks of the preacher 
to remind us, to turn our attention so that we might indeed stop in the midst 
of all that activity and take notice of the wonders and signs before us. What 
are small (and large) wonders that have taken place in the life of your church, 
signs that merit our time and attention? Do the many activities of our life as 
a congregation get added to our busy calendars as more and more stress, or are 
they qualitatively different? Do they feed us, or drain us? These early Christians, 
clearly, were fed by the things they did and the way they lived. How might we 
stop, take stock, and begin afresh in our shared life so that those &#8220;things&#8221; we 
are about actually nourish, rather than consume us? How do you think visitors 
to your church perceive the activity of those who are there? Are your visitors 
drawn into the life of your church, or do they remain observers? Is the spirit 
of your church contagious? Do others find themselves wanting to learn more, to 
gather with the folks in your church, to break and share the bread, to pray not 
in solitude but in community? <br>
<br>
And then there are the implications and indications of this shared life outside 
the church building: do the members of your congregation experience their lives 
as transformed because of that membership and participation? Do the gatherings, 
studies, and worship experiences resound and echo through their lives, out there 
in the world into which we are sent? Do you think we even begin to share our possessions 
with those around us so that everyone has enough? How does this reading sound 
to our 21st century, capitalist, private-property ears? How is <i><b>God still 
speaking</b></i> to us today, through this reading and through the images that 
come to us on the nightly news, about the ownership and accumulation of property 
to excess? How uncomfortable does this reading make your congregation? <br>
<br>
How do we, in a very different time and place, remain true to the heart of this 
ideal? Do we believe in the power of the Spirit to transform the way we live together? 
Is the sharing of our possessions, including the generous support of God&#8217;s mission 
through the church, limited to the church? How does this reading affect how we 
might consider school levies, poverty programs, and issues of economic justice? 
Do our lives reach and impact others, even beyond our sight, in ways never imagined 
when this account was written down? How does the <i><b>still-speaking God</b></i> 
call us to think in new and imaginative ways about our responsibility and our 
call to share generously? <br>
<br>
Just as awe seems to be in short supply (no matter how much we over-use the word 
"awesome" in conversation), so are "glad and generous hearts" rare in our time. 
Why do you think so many people are diagnosed or undiagnosed depressives? What 
has our society done or become that presses down our hearts and minds even in 
the midst of incredible affluence, for depression does not care about income or 
class? How might we imagine our lives re-shaped and re-directed, even significantly, 
so that we might experience "glad and generous hearts?" Do you have stories of 
people who came to your church, whose lives were transformed? Have we passed by, 
and failed to notice?

to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, 
they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising

they have repeatedly done in recent years. But science cannot motivate people 
to change their harmful ways. It takes a passionate faith to move people in new 
directions&#8211;and only religion can provide that. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The idea that taking care of the environment is a religious duty is hardly 
new. In the beginning, according to the Book of Genesis, God placed humanity in 
charge of creation. But, by and large, God&#8217;s people have not been good stewards 
of God&#8217;s creation. 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">While most of us were indifferent to the growing environmental crisis, a few 
among us preached a new stewardship of creation. Now some in government seem to 
have heard them. In 2003, the Climate Stewardship bill was introduced in the United 
States Senate. In the very first vote on this legislation to provide a comprehensive 
national policy on global warming, it received forty-three votes. That was an 
encouraging sign, especially since a broad popular movement had yet to be mobilized 
to advocate for passage of the bill.

Sabbath, let us pledge our assistance to the leaders in religion and science who 
are calling for public policies to reduce climate change while there is still 
time to make a significant difference, and our encouragement to the lawmakers 
who are working to make global stewardship the law of the land.

from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation 
as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung 
or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical 
psalter with refrains and music.

sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is 
a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically 
related to the other readings.
