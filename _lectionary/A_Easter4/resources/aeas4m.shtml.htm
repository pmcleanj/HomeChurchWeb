<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 2:42-47</strong>
<p>The apostles and the Jerusalem crowd have witnessed the coming of
the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Peter, on behalf of the apostles, has
interpreted the event. Based on Joel, he has shown that the final age
is here, and that salvation for all whom God calls and who call on him
is happening now. He tells the crowd that Jesus, the Messiah, is our
access point to salvation. To be saved from adverse judgement, repent
and be baptised in Jesus&#8217; name! Tell the good news to all who will
hear, so that they too may have new life in Christ. Many do turn to
Christ and are baptised.</p>
<p>The first part of Acts is made up of example stories and summaries.
Our reading is the first summary; it gives us a glimpse of the very
early church, of the response of the newly baptised. In accepting the
good news, they whole-heartedly embrace learning about the faith,
responsibility and love for fellow Christians, &#8220;breaking of bread&#8221; (an
extension of Jewish festive meals to re-presentation of the Lord&#8217;s
Supper) and &#8220;prayers&#8221;. God predicted through Joel that &#8220;many wonders
and signs&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A43" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">43</a>) would be seen in the end times; 
an example is in <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+3%3A1-11" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">3:1-11</a>. In these 
early days, they have &#8220;all things in common&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A44" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">44</a>), but a little later such sharing 
was not the universal rule: see <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+5%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">5:4</a>. 
As faithful Jews, they visit the Temple daily (a forum Jesus had used) and share in the Eucharist &#8220;at home&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A46" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">46</a>). As God has already increased 
their numbers (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+2%3A41" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">41</a>), so he 
continues to do. Later animosity developed with adherents to Judaism.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<strong>Psalm 23</strong>
<p>In the ancient Near East, the king was seen as shepherd (vv.

his sheep, and constantly cares for them. He revives our very lives (&#8220;soul&#8221;, v.

(&#8220;right paths&#8221;). Even when beset by evil (&#8220;darkest valley&#8221;, v.

God&#8217;s &#8220;rod&#8221; (a defence against wolves and lions) protects us; his &#8220;staff&#8221; (v.

is even more impressive, for it is in the presence of his foes. Kings
were plenteously anointed with oil (a symbol of power and dedication to
a holy purpose.) May God&#8217;s &#8220;goodness and mercy&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Psalms+23%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>, steadfast love) follow (or 
<em>pursue</em>) him (as do his enemies) throughout his life. He will continue to worship (&#8220;dwell ...&#8221;) in the Temple as long as he lives.</p>

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<strong>1 Peter 2:19-25</strong>
<p>It seems that the first readers were seen as inferior socially by
their pagan neighbours. The author has exhorted them to &#8220;conduct
yourselves honourably&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A12" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">12</a>),
even when maligned (as they are), for God wills that they live
blameless, ethical lives &#8211; thus inviting their neighbours to examine
the Christian way. Being &#8220;servants of God&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>), they are &#8220;free&#8221; 
from the burden of sin; they should use this freedom for good. The Greek word translated as &#8220;servants&#8221; also means <em>slaves</em>, so what the author says now applies equally to Christian slaves and other Christians. (The early church 
saw no inherent evil in slavery. All Christians were free spiritually and members of &#8220;the family of believers&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A17" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">17</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaves&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>)
are to obey their masters, whether they are considerate or &#8220;harsh&#8221;.
Being beaten for wrong-doing is to be expected, but God notices when
slaves endure wrongfully inflicted &#8220;pain&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>). Of this, Christ is the great 
&#8220;example&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A21" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">21</a>):
accept it as he did, as predicted in Isaiah. Christians see the Servant
Songs of Isaiah as predicting the events of Jesus&#8217; life. Isaiah <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Isaiah+53%3A5-9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">53:5-9</a>, part of the fourth 
Servant Song (quoted in part in vv.

and death: when &#8220;abused&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">23</a>) he entrusted himself to 
God&#8217;s care, &#8220;the one who judges justly&#8221;. Jesus carried our sins on the cross, thereby enabling us to live &#8220;free from sins&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>) and to attain union with God 
(&#8220;righteousness&#8221;). Through Jesus&#8217; suffering they have access to eternal life.</p>
<p>The addressees have turned their lives around by accepting Christ (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=1Peter+2%3A25" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">25a</a>).
The &#8220;shepherd&#8221;-flock image of God and his people is found in today&#8217;s
psalm and elsewhere in the Old Testament; in the gospels, Jesus is the
shepherd. In this book, the image is applied to Christian leaders and
those in their care. Later the Greek word <em>episkopos</em> (&#8220;guardian&#8221;) came to mean <em>bishop</em>.</p>

<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 10:1-10</strong>
<p>In Chapter <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9</a>,
Jesus has raised the ire of some religious leaders by giving sight to a
blind man on the Sabbath. Some of them have heard Jesus say &#8220;&#8216;I came
into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and
those who do see may become blind&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A39" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9:39</a>). Some have asked him, 
&#8220;&#8216;Surely we are not blind, are we?&#8217;&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A40" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9:40</a>), to which he has replied. 
&#8220;&#8216;If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your sin remains.&#8217;&#8221; 
(<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+9%3A41" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">9:41</a>) Thinking themselves worthy 
makes them unworthy in God&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Now Jesus uses a metaphor to expand on his point (but no metaphor
works perfectly). In Palestine, sheep belonging to villagers roamed
freely during the day but were confined to a common enclosure at night,
to protect them from predators. Each morning, each shepherd called his
sheep who followed him to pasture.</p>
<p>While &#8220;this figure of speech&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A6" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">6</a>) is hard for us to understand in 
detail (as it was for those who heard Jesus), we can get the <em>drift</em>. So irate does the metaphor make the leaders that they try to stone him (in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>) and, in v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A40" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">40</a>, Jesus flees across the Jordan. 
As he explains (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A7" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">7</a>), he is the 
&#8220;gate&#8221; of v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A2" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">2</a>, so 
presumably the <em>thieves and bandits</em> are the Jewish religious leaders. Jesus, both the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; (v.

faithful to follow him (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+10%3A4" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">4</a>); they 
don&#8217;t follow a &#8220;stranger&#8221; (v.
