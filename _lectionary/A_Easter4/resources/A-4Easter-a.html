<h4>The Shepherd and Sheep Gate</h4>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Do you have a pet dog? How have you tried to train that dog? What limits and freedoms do you give your dog?</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Ah! The joys of owning a dog.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Broding household has a dog. A German shepherd
mix named Teddy. Teddy is intelligent, for he is the only dog I know
who barks at the television when an animal (not a human) appears on the
set. I have two options for watching television with Teddy in the room.
Either I quickly use the remote control channel button to avoid the
animals. Or, I put him on leash. In either case, I try to control the
situation, like a gatekeeper. In many other ways, I lead Teddy by
calling him, petting him, and encouraging him. Most of the time, Teddy
responds admirably. But, sometimes he doesn't.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There is a strong, emotional bond between my family
members and Teddy. He is part of our family. We are his pack. This bond
is analogous to the relationship that Jesus has with us. He is our
gatekeeper. He is our shepherd. And, we belong to his flock.</p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>Jesus told the Pharisees:</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">1 Listen! The thief
doesn't enter the sheep pen through the gate. He climbs in another way.
2 But the shepherd of the flock enters through the gate. 3 The guard
will open the gate for the shepherd. Then, the shepherd will call his
own sheep, each by name. They will hear his voice and follow him out. 4
After the shepherd gathers all his sheep outside the pen, he leads
them. His sheep follow him because they know the sound of his voice. 5
The sheep won't follow a stranger. No, they will run away because they
don't know the sound of the stranger's voice.</font></b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b>6 Jesus used the image about the shepherd, but
the Pharisees didn't understand what Jesus was talking about. So, Jesus
told them in a different way:</b></p>
<p class="maroontext"><b><font color="#ee0000">7 Listen! I am the gate
the flock enters! 8 Everyone else is a robber. But the sheep don't
listen to them. 9 I am the gate! If anyone enters God's Kingdom through
me will find God's life! They will go back and forth freely. And they
will find pasture. 10 The thief only comes to destroy my flock. But, I
came to give life to my flock. God's life!</font></b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus used two images to describe his relationship
with us: the shepherd and the gate. In a relationship with him, he
leads us. But he puts conditions on that relationship, the
responsibilities of discipleship.</p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Jesus told the Phraisees:</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b><font color="#ee0000">1 "Amen, amen, I say to
you. The (one) not coming through the gate of the courtyard of the
sheep but going over (the wall or fence) another (way), that (person)
is a thief and robber. 2 But, the one coming through the gate is the
shepherd of the sheep. 3 The gatekeeper opens (the gate) for this
(person), the sheep hear his voice, (the shepherd) calls (his) own
sheep, (each) by name, and he leads them out (of the courtyard). 4 When
he brings out all (his) own, he walks in front of them and they follow,
because they know his voice. 5 They will (certainly) not follow
another, but will flee from him, because they do not know the sound of
the other." </font>6 Jesus told them this parable, but they did not know what he was telling them.</b></p>
<p class="indent">10:1 "...that (man) is a thief and robber." Was John redundant? Or did he have two different images in mind?</p>
<p class="indent">One of the more interesting theories about different
images lay in the tradition of the robber-marauder. In 165 B.C., Judas
Maccabee led a successful revolt against the Syrians who occupied
Palestine and violated the Temple in Jerusalem. The Maccabees used the
tactics of the robber-marauder to strike against the Syrians and their
sympathizers, like Robin Hood and his Merry Men.</p>
<p class="indent">After the revolt, the Maccabees proclaimed their
family royalty and even claimed the power of the Temple priesthood.
Both assertions had Messianic overtones. In time, the Maccabean kings
(also known as the Hasmonean dynasty) proved to be as corrupt as the
Syrians. Fighting within the royal family was one of the determining
factors that led to the Roman conquest of Palestine in 65 B.C. and the
rise of King Herod.</p>
<p class="indent">The image of the robber-bandit with Messianic
aspirations raised the dark shadow of the hated Hasmoneans. Their power
led to heartache among the people and the eventual destruction of the
nation. In this light, the robber-marauders who freed the nation from
oppression acted as thieves among their own countrymen.</p>
<p class="indent">According to this theory, Jesus used the image as a
means to compare the Pharisees with the Hasmoneans. Both had
aspirations of power. Both used the image of the Messiah to met their
ends. Both would not serve the people or their interests.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These passages comprise a small portion of a debate
Jesus had with the Pharisees. John placed these verses immediately
after Jesus healed the man born blind in Jerusalem (9:1-41). Remember
the Pharisees excommunicated the healed man because he defended Jesus.
So, these passages reflected the polemic of Jesus against the
leadership of the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus began by getting the attention of the
Pharisees with an emphatic phrase: "Amen! Amen! I say to you." [10:1,7]
Jesus implied he was witnessing to the Pharisees; he was really telling
them "the way it was."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, Jesus painted a urban image with two
interlocking pastoral symbols (the shepherd and the sheep gate).
Imagine a house with a stone-walled courtyard. Various sub-groupings an
extended family occupied the "apartments" of the house. To protect the
families' animals (in this case sheep), family members brought them
into the confines of the courtyard at night. A gatekeeper acted as
guard for the family and its valuable assets. [10:3a]</p>
<p class="bodytext">The family considered anyone who did not enter
through the gate an enemy. Such an enemy would sneak over the wall in
the dark of night to steal valuables and terrorize the family. The
Greek word for "thief" implied approach by stealth. The Greek word for
robber implied "intimidation." [10:1]</p>
<p class="bodytext">Using the thief and terrorist as background, Jesus
introduced the image of the good shepherd. The good shepherd entered
through the gate, as he was recognized by the gatekeeper. [10:3a] The
good shepherd loved his sheep. He called them with a special sound and
he had a name for each of them. [10:3b] The good shepherd walked in
front of the flock and they followed. [10:4] Jesus evoked a sense of
trust for the shepherd. The gatekeeper and the sheep both believed in
the shepherd. But, the sheep would not follow one who stole or
intimidated the flock. [10:5]</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here, Jesus cut to the heart of the matter. Who led
the faithful to God's Kingdom, the Pharisees or Jesus? Both agreed that
God established a covenant relationship with his people build upon
mutual self-giving. God intervened in history to save and guide his
people. His people, in turned, owed him fidelity. But, the Pharisees
and Jesus represented two different types of fidelity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Pharisees held God's people could express
fidelity only through strict adherence to the commands found in Torah.
Sincere, heartfelt fulfillment of the Torah raised duty to an act of
worship. And, at the same time, fulfilling God's Law allowed the
faithful to glimpse into the mind of the Law-giver. If one could act in
true duty, raise adherence to prayer and insight, one could grow closer
to God and hasten the day of God's Kingdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As the leaders of a Law-keeping community, the
Pharisees saw themselves as interpreters and judges. They led through
legislation, striving to create a "fence around the Torah" with a set
of guidelines that controlled every aspect of daily life. With the
multiplicity of guidelines, no one could possibly break the Law by
accident.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In one sense, the Law liberated the faithful, for
it gave them a certain spiritual path. However, the Law burdened the
outcasts. They could not easily enter into a community of Law-keepers,
no matter how magnanimous. As a result, they felt hope stolen away and
feared the sanctions of the Law. Did God really want the outcasts so
distant?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus countered this approach with faith. If one
could not trust in themselves to please God (who truly could?), he or
she could trust Jesus who did please his Father. The sinner, the
outcast, and the Gentile simply aligned themselves with Christ and
approached the Father through Christ. Relationship replaced adherence
as the road to fidelity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Unlike the Pharisees, Jesus presented himself as
the "Good Shepherd," the messenger who could bring all God's people
together in hope. The message of the Pharisees was parochial, but the
message of Jesus was universal. Yahweh was the God of all, the God for
all. Jew or Gentile. Slave or free. Saint or sinner. Trust in Jesus,
the messenger led one to the Yahweh.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There was just one problem with this image of Jesus
as the Good Shepherd. No one really believed a shepherd led a moral
life. Shepherds left their wives and families without protection for
months on end. Popular rumors had shepherds taking license with their
sheep. And, according popular wisdom, shepherds ran from their flocks
at the first sign of trouble. No wonder the Pharisees did not
understand Jesus! [10:6]</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: The Church's Origin, Foundation, and Mission (CCC 751, 759-762)</p>
<p class="indent">Beneath the question of community leadership, lay a deeper one. What does it mean to be God's people?</p>
<p class="indent">Originally, the word for Church ("ecclesia" in Greek)
meant (a group of) "those called out." The Church teaches that from the
beginning of time God chose to call people together and share himself
with them. Through Abraham, he called a people to be his own. Through
Moses, he liberated that people and welded them into a nation. Through
David, he planted the seeds of divine leadership for that people.
Through Jesus, he gave his people an intimate presence. Throughout
history, God has invited a people closer to himself and provided the
means for that intimacy.</p>
<p class="indent">God gathered his people over time. Finally, with the
incarnation, God would sweep aside any obstacle, whether sin or pride,
to an intimate life with all people. He now offers us the same gift:
eternity with him. All he asks in return is trust. Trust in himself and
trust in his Son, the messenger.</p>
<p class="indent">The Church is the community of those who trust.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Have you ever felt that your best was not good
enough? Have you ever been in a situation that demanded trust in God?
Compare the two experiences.</i></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>7 Again, Jesus said to them, <font color="#ee0000">"Amen,
amen, I say to you. I am the gate of the sheep. 8 All, as many as came
[before me] are thieves and robbers, but my sheep did not listen to
them. 9 I am the (sheep) gate! If someone goes in through me, he will
be saved; he will enter and exit; and he will find pasture. 10 The
thief does not comes except that he might steal, slaughter, and
destroy. I came that they might have life and they might have it
overflowing."</font></b></p>
<p class="indent">10:8 Who are the "all" in this verse? While the
thieves and robbers can be paralleled with those in 10:1, the time
frame of "before me" seems to infer other false prophets, leaders, and
Messiahs before the appearance of Jesus. Does this phrase include the
false leaders in the entire Old Testament? The context of the verses
seem to point to the Pharisees, but the false leaders cannot be ruled
out.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now Jesus compared himself to the gate of the sheep
courtyard. He controlled access. All others would have to climb the
walls and take the sheep by force. Those who preceded Jesus (presumably
the Pharisees) stole the sheep and persecuted the family. No one would
possibly follow such a ruffian. [10:7-8]</p>
<p class="bodytext">Unlike the thief and persecutor, Jesus provided
salvation, freedom, and spiritual sustenance. He came to give his
followers a full and complete life, for he gave them eternal life.
[10:9-10] Jesus declared he not only brought the message of God's
intimacy, he stood as its means.</p>
<p class="catsubtitle">Catechism Theme: The Church's Origin, Foundation, and Mission (CCC 763-769)</p>
<p class="indent">Christ centers the Church in himself. He is its
source. His very Spirit is its means. Without Christ, the Church fails
to exist. With Christ, the faithful touch God's Kingdom, for he is the
presence of the Kingdom to all.</p>
<p class="indent">How does Christ center the Church in himself? Through
his Holy Spirit. The Spirit gathers all believers into Christ's body.
It breathes its fruits and charisms into that Body. The Spirit empowers
leadership to proclaims God's Word and act in the place of Christ at
sacramental worship. It makes Christ present to the Church, especially
at Eucharist. Through the Spirit, Christ reaches out, brings all people
to himself, and presents them to the Father.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Has faith in Christ given you times of safety, freedom, or spiritual sustenance? Share those experiences. </i></p>
<p class="bodytext">An aside:</p>
<p class="indent">With one changed word, John painted the scene that
rang true with his audience. Sheep were normally field animals, held in
countryside corrals. By changing the term "corral" to "courtyard" (in
10:1) John turned sheep into household pets. He also transformed a
rural pen with wood fences into an urban apartment house with stone
walls. Since, the early Church and the synagogue movement of the
Pharisees competed in the cities, this change made some sense.</p>
<p class="indent">The early Church communities and the Jewish
synagogues gathered as "houses" (i.e., extended families) whose
strength faced a hostile, pagan world. A community of believers,
whether Jewish or Christian, could combine talent and treasure to
survive in a foreign environment. A synagogue or a Christian church
also possessed its own world view and cultural practices that gave it a
unique flavor, just like a proud family.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time John's gospel was completed, however,
Christianity just began to break away from Judaism. In the eyes of
pagan society, Christianity stood as a cult within Judaism. Hence,
in-fighting broke out between the groups. So, according to John, the
Pharisees (leaders in the Jewish synagogues) strove to "reconvert"
Jewish Christians (steal sheep) and persecute an excommunicated
Christian community (terrorize the sheep).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We are the flock of the Lord. But, like sheep, we
can wander off in our own direction. And be at the mercy of thieves and
false Messiahs. Jesus brings us back, like a good shepherd. And he
gives us a true way to the Father. His very self!</p>
<p class="bodytext">The next time you see a sheep flock or a family
dog, think of Jesus, the way he treats you, and what he offers you. Who
knows? You might be tempted to see pet ownership as a reflection of
Christ's care for you. And you might resolve to become a better pet
master.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>How do you remain in the Lord's flock? Trust in
Jesus and his way. That trust has changed you and continues to change
you. How can you share that change with others? </i></p>
