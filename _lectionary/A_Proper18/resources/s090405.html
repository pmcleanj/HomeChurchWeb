Above all, restoration.  How do we know this?  Again, look at the setting of the passage itself within the Gospel of Matthew.  Just before these verses, Jesus has spoken of God’s great care and concern for “the little ones,” and, although we have popularly heard these words to mean innocent, lovable little children, they can be better understood as describing the newest members, those who are fresh to the faith and susceptible to straying or being misled.  <br><br>God’s persistent and tender care, Jesus says, is like that of a shepherd who leaves the flock in search of just one little one who is lost, because it’s all about finding and seeking (think lost coin and treasure in a field) and restoration (think Prodigal Son and each one of us).  If God wills that not one little one should be lost, then the process outlined by the earliest church in this Gospel passage is not about punishment but about methodical, respectful, earnest, always hopeful, restoration.   Again, considering context leads us to read this passage with the very next passage in mind, when Peter gets legalistic (and don’t we all?), asking for the number of times we need to forgive one another (just give us a guideline here for the making of rules, he says, and no one can doubt his sincerity; in fact, we’re often glad someone asked our questions back then).  <br><br>What follows, in next week’s passage, is also about forgiveness and reconciliation.  In any case, keeping these settings, in time and text, in mind, we read about a marvelously humane and even compassionate process that translates something of Jesus’ teaching into the workings of the life of the church in a way that we can use today, and yet seldom do.  So much of the language of the Gospels is about lilies of the field, shepherds and lost sheep, transfiguration and resurrection (all good, of course), yet here is remarkably ordinary, almost mundane language about the “mechanism” that invites the most graceful experience of all, healing and reconciliation. <br><br>How much of the conflict in your church is an undercurrent, a river or stream flowing beneath the worship life, the fellowship time, the service toward one another and the world, an undercurrent bubbling up here and there in shared glances, careful avoidance, unspoken words but simmering feelings, the “hidden histories” that shape or distort your decisions or direction as a community of faith? Or are the conflicts lying on the surface in pools, puddles, or ugly potholes that everyone tries to step around? To what degree do you and your church members believe that hurts and resentments or even injuries are personal burdens to be carried or, worse, badges of righteousness entitling us to our resentments?  How much do these personal hurts, longstanding or not, tear in ways both great and small at the fabric of your church’s life?  In what ways have you confronted such injuries so that healing and greater health were experienced by all involved?  How does the line “let such a one be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector” strike you and the members of your church (presumably Gentiles themselves, and perhaps even a tax collector or two)?  When you consider how Jesus treated Gentiles and tax collectors, what does this say about the ultimate vision of this process?  <br><br>Framed by a search for the lost and an extravagance of forgiveness, this snapshot of a moment in the life of the church seeks to embody God’s own grace and tenacity.  What does the still-speaking God say to you and your church and the whole United Church of Christ about the importance of such restoration and such tenacious longing for being reconciled and whole?<!-- END SERMON SEEDS --></font><P><font size=2 face=arial,verdana,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><IMG SRC="../../logo/top.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=12 align=middle ALT="Go to top of page"> </font><font size=1 face=verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><b><A HREF="#TOP">Top</A></b></font><font size=2 face=arial,verdana,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><BR><A NAME="TXT"></A><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><B>Lectionary texts</B><!-- BEGIN OT READING --><P><B>Exodus 12:1-14</B><P>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you.

Nurses' aides, hotel housekeepers, farm workers, early childhood specialists, retail sales clerks, and janitors are examples of workers who provide vitally needed services but who usually receive wages so low that they cannot keep a family out of poverty.<P>    One-quarter of all jobs in the U.S. pay poverty-level wages. In addition, these jobs are most likely to require evening, night, weekend, or rotating shifts. They are less likely to provide health insurance, a pension, or even paid sick leave. They are more likely to be dangerous and unhealthy. They are more likely to be filled by women and people of color—marginal jobs for the already marginalized. Just like Jesus.<P>    These jobs are seldom ladders to better opportunities. And while more education can improve the job prospects for individuals, education alone will not improve these jobs. Even if all workers were college graduates, we would still need people to sweep floors and flip burgers. These jobs would still be poverty jobs. The problem is not the worker but the job.<P>    Poverty jobs can be changed into life-giving jobs if we actively seek to make this happen. We need to increase the minimum wage to at least $7.25 an hour. We need to strengthen the right of all workers to form and join unions. We need to enforce health and safety laws more adequately.<P>    Low-wage workers are high-value children of God. They must be able to support themselves and their families, and live with dignity the life of wholeness that God intends for us all. God's reign does not stop at the door of the workplace, but includes all aspects of life, including our work lives. Let us ask God=s help as we seek to live into God's reign—a reign that provides abundant life and decent wages to all workers.<I><P>Edith Rassell<BR>Justice and Witness Ministries<BR>United Church of Christ  </I><!-- END SUNDAY BULLETIN BACK PAGE --><!--END ADVPRINT --></font><P><font size=2 face=arial,verdana,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><IMG SRC="../../logo/top.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=12 align=middle ALT="Go to top of page"> </font><font size=1 face=verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><b><A HREF="#TOP">Top</A></b></font><font size=2 face=arial,verdana,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica><BR><A NAME="NOTES"></A><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B><!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES --><P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>Third Reading: Gospel<P>The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson.
