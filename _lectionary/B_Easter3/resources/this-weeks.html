<h1>I Hear Dead People</h1>


<p>We should allow our lives to be haunted   a bit by spirits of the past, to reflect on the history, and the people   who have passed.&nbsp; My pastoral internship was with a church in Hilltown,   PA that began worshipping in 1804.&nbsp; They have a cemetery attached,   and I often walked among the stones, reading the names, the dates.&nbsp;   Most of the stones marked the graves of people who have long since passed   from memory, to the point that no one alive could relate a single story   about this woman, or that man.&nbsp; There was one set of markers that   sticks in my mind, a woman, her husband and their seven-year old daughter   all died on the same day.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know: the stones   are silent about it, and the family members buried on each side of them   weren&rsquo;t talking, either.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really so creepy   as some might find it.&nbsp; Rather, it inspires humility, awe, and   both fear and assurance.&nbsp; I use that space to meditate on the fact   that I&rsquo;m one in line with all who are born.&nbsp; I have this moment   to breathe it in.&nbsp; Then, like everyone else, I will not be.&nbsp;   It&rsquo;s a bit frightening and sad that, as time goes on, my history will   quickly telescope down in size, until nothing remains at all, not even   a name on a stone.&nbsp; Contrary to the words that are often said after   someone dies, at least in this realm, I will be forgotten.&nbsp; Humbling.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now that they are forgotten, how can   we honor them?&nbsp; Our histories remember only the smallest fraction   of the names or stories of all the dead people, and yet we can honor   them by listening and passing on their voices.&nbsp; This came home   to me when one of my friends in seminary spoke of how she&rsquo;d had very   little interest in church and faith.&nbsp; She was touring in England   and stood in a very old church looking at an odd stained-glass window.&nbsp;   It spelled out the entire Apostles&rsquo; Creed.&nbsp; Standing in that   old church, she said she suddenly &ldquo;heard&rdquo; all those voices who have   recited this Creed in that church and around the world, billions of   times over, in hundreds of languages, for over a millennium and a half.&nbsp;   She felt both small, but suddenly a part of something she had not realized   was so big until that moment: faith in God, faith that there is something   much more than we can see right now.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh at ministers all you want: they   have the words we need to hear, the ones the dead have spoken.&rdquo; &ndash;   John Updike</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s why I speak   of the voices of the dead on the 3rd week of Easter: see   what God can do when all other powers destroy or fall silent!&nbsp;   Peter used this miraculous healing in Jesus&rsquo; name to point to the   healing that happens on a much greater and more permanent scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He razed his listeners   for their part in killing&mdash;not just Jesus, a man&mdash;but the &ldquo;Author   of Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He finally relented somewhat by saying, &ldquo;You were   acting in ignorance [dummies], and his suffering fulfilled what God,   through the prophets, had said would happen.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same   way, in the gospel lesson Jesus assured the disciples that his death   and suffering&mdash;not only was it ineffective in preventing God&rsquo;s salvation   and promises&mdash;God was able to turn it around to enable that salvation   &hellip;for the world, just as his prophets, said he could and would!&nbsp;   The words the dead had spoken were true and honored by God.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter had accused them   of Deicide, but assured them that God turned their condemnable act on   its head.&nbsp; Jesus&rsquo; own death paid the price of their act, in order   to extend forgiveness and salvation to his own murderers!&nbsp; &ldquo;Repent,   and your sins will be wiped out.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the message   passed on through scripture and the church.&nbsp; When we join our voices   to this proclamation or pray for each other in Christ&rsquo;s name, we join   this greater act of healing and salvation.&nbsp; In that moment, we   join the eternal chorus, and we will never be silent.&nbsp; </p>
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Psalm</h4>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This psalm is a bit   &hellip;bipolar, eh?&nbsp; Psalmist: &ldquo;Answer me, God, as you have before!&rdquo;&nbsp;   God: &ldquo;How long will you embarrass me with empty words and lies?&rdquo;&nbsp;   Psalmist: &ldquo;But remember, God has a special place for his chosen; he&rsquo;ll   hear me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The psalm includes a bit of wisdom, a call to right   worship, another cry of impatience, and assurance, etc.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first several lines   of this psalm contain the repetitive history of God&rsquo;s people in a   microcosm, all crying out at once.&nbsp; The last couple lines put it   all into the perspective of faith.&nbsp; Having God alone is having   enough.&nbsp; &mdash;It produces more gladness than all the abundance of   grain and wine, and allows us to lie down and sleep (to be vulnerable,   even to die) in peace.&nbsp; Finally, God is our safety.</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we purify ourselves,   make ourselves as worthy as Christ?&nbsp; How do we join these ranks   of God&rsquo;s children before us, and those to come after us?&nbsp; Vs.   3: &ldquo;All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is   pure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hope itself purifies.&nbsp; In other words, it is enough   to trust God for his word of forgiveness!</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciples&rsquo; fear   is a result of what Jesus called their doubts: &ldquo;Why would you doubt   in your hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on to prove to them that he is alive,   and not a dead ghost floating around to haunt them, or to suck life   from them, or to do any other horrible nasty things that ghosts might   do.</p>
	  
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve heard one preacher   suggest recently that all fear&mdash;fear of a mouse, fear of the dark,   fear of tomorrow&mdash;is ultimately connected to our fear of death.&nbsp;   It shows, perhaps, that we really don&rsquo;t trust ourselves in God&rsquo;s   hands; we are not yet absolutely convinced that it really will be okay.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a big ugly ghoul   came crashing through my door right now, I know I&rsquo;d be out of my mind   with fear, &hellip;but why should I be?&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither life, nor death,   no power, height, depth, nothing in creation can separate us from the   love of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, even if the ghoul could suck out my life,   I would still be in God&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; That may be of little help   at that particular time&mdash;but comforting otherwise!</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Christ showed   the disciples that he continues to come in the flesh!&nbsp; I can get   through this life; I can have peace in it; and maybe even delight in   it &hellip;with help!&nbsp; Jesus will continue to come in human flesh and   hands: psychologists, doctors, teachers, parents and grandparents, children   and strangers.&nbsp; They will have imperfect and scarred flesh, with   holes and nail prints.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humanity, my humanity,   will forever be imprinted into God.&nbsp; Genesis says that we are created   in God&rsquo;s image, but because of Jesus Christ, humanity will forever   be imprinted into God, with the nail prints still there.&nbsp; He loves,   understands and feels with us, even understands our fear and loneliness.&nbsp;   He&rsquo;s been there.</p>
	  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1. What things or thoughts scare     you?&nbsp; Are they connected somehow to a fear of death, or a lack     in faith?&nbsp; How does Jesus bring you peace?</p>
<p>2. What meaning do you draw from     Jesus asking for and eating a piece of broiled fish in front of the     disciples?</p>
<p>3. Peter called Jesus the &ldquo;Author     of life, whom God raised from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Jesus, the Author     of life was dead, how did God raise him?&nbsp; (A little Trinitarian     puzzle.)</p>
<p>4. What words of the church do     you treasure the most?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Do you love the sound of them,     their poetry, or their meaning?&nbsp; How have they helped sustain you     in your faith?</p>
<p>5. How can you pass those words     on to the next generation?</p>
