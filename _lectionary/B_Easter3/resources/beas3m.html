<B>Acts</B>
<P>
This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<P>Peter and John, observant Jews, have gone to the Temple at the time of day when sacrifice is offered for prayer. At the gate to the temple courtyard they have seen a man lame from birth, forced to beg in order to survive. Peter has commanded him:

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>1 John</B>
<P>
This epistle was addressed to a general audience, unlike those written by Paul. 
It shares a style, phrases and expressions with the Gospel according to John, so 
it is very likely that both were written by the same person. It appears to have 
been circulated to various churches. The author seeks to combat heresy, specifically 
that the spirit is entirely good but matter is entirely evil. John tells his readers 
that morality and ethical behaviour are important for Christians.

<B>Luke</B>
<P>
Three gospels in the New Testament offer similar portraits of the life of Jesus;
Luke is the third of them. Its author, traditionally Luke the physician who accompanied
Paul on some of his missionary journeys, draws on three sources: Mark (via Matthew),
a collection of sayings (known as Q for <I>Quelle</I>, German for <I>source</I>) and his own source. It is a
gospel that emphasizes God's love for the poor, the disadvantaged, minorities, outcasts,
sinners and lepers. Women play a more prominent part than in the other gospels. Luke
never uses Semitic words; this is one argument for thinking that he wrote primarily
for Gentiles.
