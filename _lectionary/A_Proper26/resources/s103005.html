<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>1 Thessalonians 2:9-13

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>God's Word at Work

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>"You are witnesses..."

<P>Questions:
<BR>Sometimes we need to be reminded of who we are.  Perhaps that's one of the reasons we belong in community: the reminding of who we are, and of who we are called to be, and of how we are to live.  Perhaps that's the deepest call beneath much of what we "do" in church and as the church:  in the teaching of both adults and children, in the preaching of the gospel, in the singing of hymns, in the breaking of bread and the sharing of cup.  We need to be reminded that God's hand not only shaped us but guides us still and is in fact still at work in the world, through us.  It goes much deeper than our friendships and community within our churches, invaluable and life-giving as they are.  It goes much deeper than the esteem in which we hold our greatest teachers and the respect we give our pastors, understandable as those are.   It is indeed, who we are.  It has been said that God's church doesn't have a mission, but God's mission has a church.  Indeed!  And Paul reminds the people of the church in Thessalonica, lovingly, that just as he has been nurse (last week's reading) and father to them, they must in turn see themselves as nurse and father to those who are in their midst.  They must care tenderly for one another, share the gospel of God and also their own selves, urge and encourage and plead with one another to "lead a life worthy of God," worthy of their calling. In addition to all this, they too may be called to suffer for the sake of the gospel.  This is the call of the church in every generation.  How do the members of your church see your congregation as distinct from other organizations and groups and communities to which they belong?  Sometimes folks say that they find God and real community, including spiritual nourishment, in other settings besides church.  What does that say about God being at work in the world?  Still, how is the church distinct?  How does this understanding of the church and of our call influence our commitment to the church, despite personality conflicts or differences of opinion about church decisions? Douglas Meeks has named two "maladies" that may afflict us:  amnesia, or forgetting who we are, and anesthesia, the numbing or distancing ourselves from the suffering of others.  In what ways, then, does your church remind your members, and the community it serves, of who you are as a church, and how a suffering world stands in need of your ministry?  "To live 'upward' in response to the noble calling of God and to conform one's life in an appropriately 'high' manner is to adopt a life-style worthy of the kingdom" (Craddock et al., Preaching through the Christian Year A).  What are the signs that your church is living "upward"?  How is the still-speaking God finding new ways to speak and work through you and your church, in your own setting and your own moment, this day?

<!-- BEGIN OT READING -->

<P><B>Joshua 3:7-17</B>

<P>The LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses. You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, 'When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'" Joshua then said to the Israelites, "Draw near and hear the words of the LORD your God." Joshua said, "By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites: 

<P>The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan. So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap."

<P>When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people. Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho. While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.

<P><B>Psalm 107:1-7, 33-37</B>

<P>Refrain:
<BR><B>
Consider the steadfast love of God.
</B>

<P>O give thanks to God, for God is good;
<BR>for God's steadfast love endures
<BR>forever. 

<P>Let the redeemed of God say so,
<BR>those whom God redeemed from
<BR>trouble 

<P>and gathered in from the lands,
<BR>from the east and the west, from the
<BR>north and the south. 

<P>Some wandered in desert wastes, finding
<BR>no way to an inhabited town; 

<P>hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted
<BR>within them. 

<P>Then they cried to God in their trouble,
<BR>and God delivered them from their
<BR>distress; 

<P>God led them by a straight way,
<BR>until they reached an inhabited town. 

<P>God turns rivers into a desert,
<BR>and springs of water into thirsty
<BR>ground;

<P>God turns a fruitful land into a salty
<BR>waste,
<BR>because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. 

<P>God turns a desert into pools of water,
<BR>a parched land into springs of water. 

<P>And there God lets the hungry live,
<BR>and they establish a town to live in;

<P>they sow fields, and plant vineyards,
<BR>and they get a fruitful yield.

<P><B>Micah 3:5-12</B>

<P>	Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets
	who lead my people astray,
	who cry "Peace"
	when they have something to eat,
	but declare war against those
	who put nothing into their mouths.
	Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,
	and darkness to you, without revelation.
	The sun shall go down upon the prophets,
	and the day shall be black over them;

<P>	The seers shall be disgraced,
	and the diviners put to shame;
	they shall all cover their lips,
	for there is no answer from God.
	But as for me, I am filled with power,
	with the spirit of the LORD,
	and with justice and might,
	to declare to Jacob his transgression
	and to Israel his sin.

<P>	Hear this, you rulers of the house of Jacob
	and chiefs of the house of Israel,
	who abhor justice
	and pervert all equity,
	who build Zion with blood
	and Jerusalem with wrong!

<P>	Its rulers give judgment for a bribe,
	its priests teach for a price,
	its prophets give oracles for money;
	yet they lean upon the LORD and say,
	"Surely the LORD is with us!
	No harm shall come upon us."
	Therefore because of you
	Zion shall be plowed as a field;
	Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,
	and the mountain of the house a wooded height.

Why have you cast me off, O God?

<BR>from those who are deceitful and
<BR>unjust deliver me!

<P>For you are the God in whom I take
<BR>refuge;
<BR>why have you cast me off?
<BR>Why must I walk about mournfully
<BR>because of the oppression of the

<P>O send out your light and your truth;
<BR>let them lead me;
<BR>let them bring me to your holy hill
<BR>and to your dwelling.

<P>Then I will go to the altar of God, to
<BR>God my exceeding joy;
<BR>and I will praise you with the harp,
<BR>O God, my God.

<P>Why are you cast down, O my soul,

<P><B>1 Thessalonians 2:9-13</B>

<P>You remember our labor and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was toward you believers. As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children, urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.

<P>We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God's word, which is also at work in you believers.

<P><B>Matthew 23:1-12</B>

<P>Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; therefore, do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they teach. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long. 

<P>They love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all students. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father—the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. All who exalt themselves will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted.

<P>Thirty-first Sunday in Ordinary Time
<BR>October 30, 2005
<BR>1 Thessalonians 2:9-13

<P>God's Word

<P>When members of the Hanley Road Baptist Church carry their Bibles into worship, it's not a pious gesture. It's a Reformation tradition.
<P>    The Protestant Reformation put the Bible front and center. Bible translations and the printing press put it into the worshipers' hands.
<P>    In his first letter to the Thessalonians, the Apostle Paul thanks his hosts "for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God's word...." (1 Thessalonians 2:13).  The early evangelists spread the Gospel by word of mouth. In a way, then, the truth of the Gospel depended upon the honesty of the person who told it. 

<P>    Until the Reformation, most lay people did not have access to the written Word of God. Martin Luther changed all that. He translated the Bible into German and printers published the sacred text.
<P>    Luther's translation transformed the biblical text into a new German idiomBthe vernacular. "You do not have to ask the letter of the Latin alphabet how to speak German," he said. "You ask the mother at home, the children on the street, and the common man at the square, and translate accordingly. They understand you then, and know you are giving it to them straight."
<P>    For Martin Luther, the Bible remained the one and only ground of religious authority and certainty.   Scripture "must rule and everyone must obey, and be subject to her," he declared. And now every Christian could have a printed Bible, translated into their own language.  Worshipers no longer had to accept on faith that what they heard from the pulpit really was God=s word.  They had the Bible in their very hands to prove it. Thanks be to God.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
