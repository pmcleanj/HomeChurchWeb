<h2>Faith</h2>
      

<p>I had the privilege many years ago of meeting with a 10th grade
Confirmation student named Julie just before she was to be
confirmed.&nbsp; We went over the Catechism together:&nbsp; the Lord&#8217;s
Prayer, the Creed, the Ten Commandments and their meanings. We went
over a paper she had written, in which she talked about her faith, what
she believed and how she had come to believe it.&nbsp; Toward the end
of our time together, I asked what had been most meaningful for her in
Confirmation, what had most struck her in heart, in mind, in soul.</p>
<p>Julie surprised me by bursting out into tears. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
part of the Creed where it talks about how I cannot by my own
understanding or effort come to my Lord Jesus or believe in him, but
the Holy Spirit has called me through the gospel, enlightened me with
his gifts . . . that part.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked why, the tears grew almost into sobs. Julie was a
straight A student, a track star, and a musician budding into great
potential. From the moment she got up in the morning to the moment she
went to bed at night, her life was committed to work: work as a
student, work as an athlete, work as a musician. &#8220;Because,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;my faith is the one thing that I don&#8217;t have to work at in order to be
something. Through Jesus, I just am.&#8221; </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s texts sound the great theme of the Reformation&#8212; we do not
earn the gift of salvation through our work; it comes to us freely
through our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ. We are justified by faith
through grace. We rely on the promise in the Word only for our standing
before God, the word that says it is only faith in Christ alone that
saves, through and through by grace alone, not by any hand we&#8217;ve had as
a part in it.&nbsp; Through Jesus, I just am, for sure&#8212;for now, and for
all eternity.</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;The
prophet writes of a new day, a new time. &#8220;The days are surely coming,&#8221;
says the Lord, &#8220;when I will make a new covenant with the house of
Israel and the house of Judah&#8221; (Jeremiah 31:31).&nbsp; The old covenant
was no small thing.&nbsp; It included the promise that Israel would
receive the gift of the promised land (Deuteronomy 1:8), and the gift
of the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 5:6-21). This new covenant would
be greater yet. &#8220;It will not be like the covenant that I made with
their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the
land of Egypt&#8212;a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband,
says the LORD&#8221; (Jeremiah 31:32).<strong>&nbsp; </strong>The old
covenant asked for behavior to be changed or shaped externally. The
people of God could willfully follow or ignore the law as they saw
fit.&nbsp; There was not necessarily anything internally that led them
to follow the law for its own sake, or better, for the sake of the love
of God.</p>

      <p>This new covenant will go after precisely that
which the old could not seem to get at, the heart.&nbsp; &#8220;I will put my
law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be
their God, and they shall be my people.&#8221;&nbsp; (Jeremiah 31:33).&nbsp;
The new covenant will put the law in the innermost being of God&#8217;s
people.&nbsp; No longer will it be on stone tablets; it will be written
in the very fabric their lives. They will follow it as naturally as
they will breathe.&nbsp; And they will not need to remind one another
of the Lord their God- everyone will know God, &#8220;from the least of them
to the greatest&#8221; (Jeremiah 31:34). Then the best part of all. With the
old covenant, <br>
        sin  always seemed to have a way of hanging around. Not so with the new. <br>
  &#8221;I will forgive their iniquity,&#8221; God promises, &#8220;and remember their sin no more&#8221;  (Jeremiah 31:34).</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Lesson</h4>
      <p>Here
again we hear the call to turn away from idols and to &#8220;serve a living
and true God.&#8221; This letter is written to a young church. They are
praised and admonished to continue in the life to which they are called
in Christ. The next several weeks take the epistle from Thessalonians.
The church is not without opposition and as this letter continues it
takes the form of a pastoral letter.<br><br>
  <strong>Questions for Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>1. As Christians, we believe that Jesus is the fulfillment of the
new covenant. In what ways is this so?&nbsp; How is the law written in
our hearts in Christ?&nbsp;&nbsp; How do the least to the greatest know
God in Christ?&nbsp; How do we experience the promise of forgiveness in
Christ?</p>
<p>2. As long as we live in this world, we still live in the spell of
the old covenant, even while we have the promise of life under the
new.&nbsp; In what ways have you experienced life under the old
covenant?&nbsp; In what ways does Christ provide freedom and hope in
your journey?</p>
<p>3. A Bible Study was written on this passage called, &#8220;New Hearts,
New People.&#8221; In what ways does that title capture the essence of the
text?<br> 4. Why is this text a good text for Reformation Sunday, when
we remember and celebrate that we are justified by faith through grace?
</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
<p>The very first point Paul lays down here is what the law is to be
used for. It cannot be used to justify a human being before God.
Through the law comes not perfection before God, but &#8220;knowledge of
sin.&#8221; (3:20). The law is like a mirror that reflects who we are,
imperfections and all. It is not like a ladder we can climb to find our
way into God&#8217;s good graces.<br><br>
The second point Paul makes is that the &#8220;righteousness of God&#8221; has been
revealed &#8220;apart from the law&#8221; (3:21). The goodness of God isn&#8217;t seen in
the fulfillment of the law. The goodness of God shows forth &#8220;through
faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe&#8221; (3:22). There is not any
distinction between those who are religious and good and those who are
not, and bad. &#8220;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221;
(3:23); all are &#8220;now justified by his grace as a gift&#8221; (3:24). It is as
it goes in the parable Jesus tells in Matthew 20: the worker who comes
along at the end of the day can receive the same wage as the worker who
has been at the work all day long. The wage isn&#8217;t earned. It&#8217;s a
surprise, a wonder, a treasure hidden in a field. It comes to the
sinner by Christ&#8217;s hand, freely. <br><br>
The third point Paul makes is that justification through faith in
Christ Jesus shows, in fact, the glory of God. And the last point he
makes is this: There is ground no more for boasting! There is room no
more for one to gloat in self-made religiosity, self-sustained
morality, the stuff of which self-righteousness is made. It is all
&#8220;excluded&#8221; by the &#8220;law of faith&#8221; (3:27)&#8212;which can allow for no such
nonsense. &#8220;For we hold that that a person is justified by faith apart
from works prescribed by the law&#8221; (3:28) Faith in Christ&#8217;s love saves;
work aimed toward God for the sake of salvation does nothing toward
that end.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>1. What role does the law play in the life of the believer?&nbsp;
What does faith do in a believer&#8217;s life? What happens when faith-work
gets mixed up with law-work?&nbsp; How have you experienced that
confusion?&nbsp; What has resulted for you?</p>
<p>2. Martin Luther has said that &#8220;the Christian is the freest person
of all, bound to no one; the Christian is the most subject person of
all, bound to all.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you understand his words in
light of this text?</p>
<p>3. What does salvation by grace through faith mean to you? What do
you think it means to the Church in general?&nbsp; Is it one principle
among many?&nbsp; Or is it the one principle on which the church must
stand, even, as the hymn goes, &#8220;while steeples are falling&#8221;?&nbsp; Why
or why not?</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
<p>Jesus challenges the Jews who had come to believe in him, saying
that if they continue in his word, they would truly be his disciples,
and they would know the truth, and the truth would set them free. Those
who had come to believe in Jesus took offense at him. &nbsp;They were
descendants of Abraham! They have lived in the freedom of the
covenant.&nbsp; They have never been slaves to anyone. What can Jesus
mean, then, in saying that &#8220;You will be made free&#8221; (8:33)?</p>





<p>Jesus answers with profound truth. Once having committed a sin, you
are a slave to it.&nbsp; The sin inevitably becomes your lord: it holds
you in its grip and sway. You end up doing what it says, rather than
the other way around. And the slave&#8212;the slave does not have a permanent
place in the household; that position and place belongs only to the
son. So, Jesus argues, if the son makes you free, you will be free
indeed (8:36). If the son sets you free from sin, not only are you
released from the grip of sin to the ways of the son, you are released
from the status of slave to the status of son.&nbsp; You have a place
in the household, a permanent, abiding place. You are free; free
indeed. <br>
</p>
<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; How have you seen or experienced the truth  that once having committed a sin, you are a slave to it?</p>
<p>2. Galatians 5:1 says, &#8220;For freedom Christ has set us free.&nbsp;
Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of
slavery.&#8221;&nbsp; What is the freedom for which Christ has set us free?
How is it like other freedoms we enjoy in this country?&nbsp; Unlike
them?&nbsp; What enables us to &#8220;stand firm&#8221; so that we &#8220;do not submit
again to a yoke of slavery?&#8221;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Why would you want a permanent, abiding place  in the household rather than a fleeting one?</p>
<p>4.  Why is this a good text for Reformation Sunday?</p>
