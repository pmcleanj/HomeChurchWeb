<h1>The Prophetic Task</h1>
<p>I hope that you will agree with me, that   the individual Christian and the body of believers, the Church, have   several roles that they play in the world.&nbsp; First and foremost,   we are evangelists proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ in word   and in deed wherever we find ourselves.&nbsp; We are also priests, if   you will, interceding in prayer and reaching out to the suffering people   of the world in the name of God and being God&rsquo;s presence in the world.&nbsp;   Next, we are pastors in the sense that we shepherd and care for one   another in the Christian community.&nbsp; We support each other and   &ldquo;bear one another&rsquo;s burdens&rdquo; to quote St. Paul in Galatians 6:2.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, one of the roles we play is   that of prophet, speaking God&rsquo;s word of correction and criticism.&nbsp;   To quote Patricia Datchuck Sanchez, &ldquo;The prophet rarely tells a story,   but rather, critiques people and events.&nbsp; The prophet rarely sings,   but castigates.&nbsp; She does more than translate reality onto poetic   key; she is a preacher whose purpose is not self-expression or purgation   of emotions, but communication.&nbsp; The prophet&rsquo;s images must not   shine; they must burn and etch the message of God&rsquo;s justice, truth   and goodness in the human heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Oh my!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about you,   but that one gives me pause.&nbsp; After all, when I think of the people   we consider prophets in our day, things didn&rsquo;t fair too well for them.&nbsp;   Martin Luther King Jr., Archbishop Oscar Romero, Mohandas Gandhi all   of them we consider prophets now but at the time they spoke out many   saw them as rebels.&nbsp; People who were trying to stir things up.&nbsp;   People who were rocking the boat and attacking conventional wisdom.&nbsp;   All three paid the price of their lives.&nbsp; Do we really want to   be prophets?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that in our country   over the past few years, it seems there is no longer room for disagreement   and debate.&nbsp; Lately people who speak an opposing word, a critical   word, are considered unpatriotic, in support of the enemy, and, by some   folks, just down right evil.&nbsp; Do we really want that prophetic   role?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Whether we want it or not is really not   our choice.&nbsp; For you see it is God that calls us to the prophetic   role.&nbsp; It is God who wants to use us to point out God&rsquo;s sovereignty   over our human made idols.&nbsp; It is God that wants us to point out   systems which dehumanize and oppress.&nbsp; It is God that calls us   to speak even to the nations about the ways of peace.&nbsp; Both the   old and new testaments make this point over and over again.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>In our texts this week we are presented   with three prophets of God, Ezekiel, Paul and Jesus.&nbsp; Each one   has something to say to us about what it means to be a prophet of God   and what the costs are.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
      <p>Our reading from Ezekiel stresses two   points already made and presents us with two more.&nbsp; First, the   call to the prophetic role comes from God.&nbsp; If we ever find ourselves   or our communities of faith speaking their own words from their own   perspective, that is not from God.&nbsp; God calls us to speak God&rsquo;s   words.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>How can we know that our word comes from   God and not from ourselves?&nbsp; We need to test those words against   Scripture, the Gospel and our Christian tradition.&nbsp; Unfortunately   (for some) that means yes, we have to read our Bibles.&nbsp; We have   to know what Jesus said, taught and did in his ministry.&nbsp; We have   to know our tradition, not everything ever written, but the basics.&nbsp;   These things will assist us when we are confronted with things that   are not mentioned in the Bible, but confront our generations at this   time.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>Second, our passage from Ezekiel tells   us that people may not want to hear what we have to say on behalf of   God.&nbsp; We too live with an &ldquo;impudent and stubborn&rdquo; generation   and sometimes that includes us!&nbsp; Being a prophet has its risks,   that why it is so hard.&nbsp; It would be much easier to &ldquo;go with   the flow&rdquo; to turn the other way and just accept that things cannot   be changed.&nbsp; However, when the call of God comes it is hard to   reject that call.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>The third is similar in that there is   really no &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; time to be a prophet.&nbsp; Ezekiel was a   prophet for 20 years during a catastrophic time in Israel&rsquo;s history.&nbsp;   The Babylonians had just captured Jerusalem, the cream of Jerusalem   society was being led away into captivity, and people wondered where   God had gone and why God had abandoned them.&nbsp; The gravity of the   situation was such that we are told that after the call described in   this week&rsquo;s text, Ezekiel did nothing for seven days but sit (Ezekiel   3:15).&nbsp; The people had experienced a terrible loss and Ezekiel   had thoughts about &ldquo;rubbing their nose&rdquo; in the disaster.&nbsp; Indeed   there is no convenient time to be a prophet.</p>
      <p>Finally, if one is looking for raging   success, the prophecy business is not for them.&nbsp; As a prophet there   is no guarantee that people will listen to you, let alone change their   behavior.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s declaration to Ezekiel is also for us, &ldquo;whether   they hear or refuse to hear, they shall know that there has been a prophet   among them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>We don&rsquo;t often think of Paul as a prophet,   but he certainly was in regards to some of the Christian communities   he established and especially to the Corinthians from which our text   comes.&nbsp; Paul often called the churches to task for straying from   the Gospel.&nbsp; Paul did so not so that he could boast that somehow   he was the definitive word, but because God had called him to speak   the truth in love.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <p>In our text this week, Paul reminds his   readers that he has no reason to boast for it is Jesus working through   him.&nbsp; The first part of our text seems a bit cryptic, but Paul   is actually taking about a vision he had.&nbsp; Paul felt privileged   to have been granted such a vision and felt that he certainly could   boast of having such a vision.&nbsp; However, Paul would not boast in   his vision but in his weakness.&nbsp; It is the hardships that Paul   faces for the sake of Jesus that are important.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
	  <p>To remind him of this, Paul claims that   he was given a &ldquo;thorn in the flesh&rdquo;, some physical defect so that   God would be glorified.&nbsp; What exactly this &ldquo;thorn in the flesh&rdquo;   was is the subject of many articles and some books.&nbsp; While it would   be nice to know, the point remains that Paul learned that God&rsquo;s strength   as found in human weakness.&nbsp;<br />
	    </p>
	  <p>This is good for a prophet to know.&nbsp;   Again, the prophet is reminded that it is God and not the prophet who   speaks.&nbsp; The prophet has no reason or room to boast in him/herself.&nbsp;   If the prophet boasts, the prophet boasts of the Lord.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
	  <p>It is also good to know that God&rsquo;s   strength is shown in the prophet&rsquo;s weakness.&nbsp; So often it is   tempting for us to ignore the call of God to the prophetic role by asking   ourselves, &ldquo;Who am I to be called by God to speak to this issue?&rdquo;&nbsp;   I have no special insight, I have no special training, in the face of   the world and the opposition, I am nobody, I am weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; To that   excuse, St. Paul would say, &ldquo;Yes indeed, but God&rsquo;s power will shine   through your weakness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
	  <p>Our themes are again found in this week&rsquo;s   Gospel reading.&nbsp; Jesus is the savior of the world, but Jesus is   also a prophet.&nbsp; I have often said in sermons, in my teaching,   and here in WORDLINK that one does not get one&rsquo;s self nailed to a   cross for simply supporting the conventional wisdom.&nbsp; One does   not receive the ire and wrath of the religious leaders by agreeing with   their every teaching and practice.&nbsp; Indeed Jesus spoke the Word   of God and was rejected and crucified for it.&nbsp;<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>In our text this week, Jesus returns   home after a rather successful ministry in other parts of Galilee.&nbsp;   Once home, just like a visiting seminarian or former pastor, Jesus is   invited to preach/teach in the synagogue.&nbsp; We are told by Mark   that at first, many who heard him were astounded.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is this   wisdom that has been given to him?&nbsp; What deeds of power are being   done by his hands!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
	    </p>
	  <p>Yet, as they reflect, they begin to question   Jesus.&nbsp; Is this not the carpenter who made our furniture and repaired   our roofs?&nbsp; Is this not the son of Mary, the snotty-nosed kid who   used to run around the village?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t his brothers and sisters   still here and they didn&rsquo;t amount to much?&nbsp; Who does this Jesus   think that he is, the Messiah?&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, Mark tells us they   &ldquo;took offense at him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
	    </p>
	  <p>Jesus then sums up a bit of street wisdom   we still hold to be true.&nbsp; We might say that &ldquo;you are an expert   if you come from a distance but in your own setting you&rsquo;re just another   ______.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Prophets are not without honor, except in their   hometown&rdquo; is how Jesus put it.&nbsp; Mark then tells us that Jesus   could do no deed of power there, except to heal a few of the sick.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
	  <p>But an amazing thing does happen.&nbsp;   Shortly thereafter, Jesus sends his disciples out two by two to carry   on his ministry on their own.&nbsp; He calls them to a servant&rsquo;s task   but he also alludes at a prophetic task.&nbsp; Here our themes re-emerge.&nbsp;   The people may not listen to you.&nbsp; If that is so, shake the dust   off your sandals and move on.&nbsp; They will know that a prophet has   been in their midst.&nbsp;<br />
	    </p>
	  <p>So it was with Ezekiel and so it is with   you and me.&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
        <p>1. Who are some &ldquo;prophets&rdquo;     you admire?&nbsp; Why do you admire them?</p>
<p>
   2. What are the qualities of     a prophet?</p>
<p>3. Can you identify any people     today, who might not yet be considered prophets, but whom you feel just     might be?</p>
<p>4. Why is it that we have trouble     hearing a prophet until after they are dead and gone?&nbsp; Why is it     that later, their words make sense to us while at the time they may     have inspired rage in us?</p>
<p>5. When have you been called     to be a prophet of God?&nbsp; What was it like?&nbsp; How did others     react to you?</p>
<p>6. How do you feel about the     Church speaking prophetically?&nbsp; Does that bother you?&nbsp; Why     or why not?</p>
<p>7. What are some issues which     the Church should be prophetic about in our day?&nbsp; What do you think     God has to say about those issues?</p>
