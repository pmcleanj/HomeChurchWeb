<b>Isaiah</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 
were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were 
difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought 
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, 
and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social 
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 
40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled 
with a message of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. 
Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, 
written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope 
and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. 
Like <i>Second Isaiah</i>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore 
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples. 

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Isaiah 43:16-21</strong>
<p>Babylonian armies captured Jerusalem in 587 BC; many residents were deported 
to Babylon. Chapters 40 to 55 of Isaiah were written there in the final years 
of the Exile. The author had great faith in God as intervening in human affairs 
when needed throughout history. He sustains the theme of a new Exodus 
throughout <em>Second Isaiah</em>: God will surely restore the Israelites to 
Judea (v. 14).</p>
<p>A prophet serves as a channel of communication between the divine and the 
human realms. Today we say that <em>history repeats itself</em>; this prophet 
would add: <em>continually</em>. In vv. 16-17, he recalls God&#8217;s saving 
act of enabling the Israelites to cross the Reed (or Red) Sea: how the waters 
separated, providing &#8220;a way in the sea&#8221;, and how the Egyptian 
chariots, &#8220;army and warrior[s]&#8221;, were swallowed up by the waters, 
&#8220;never to rise again&#8221; (Revised English Bible). This is who God is: 
he was the motive force behind Israel&#8217;s deliverance; he saved Israel from 
slavery. (Perhaps the audience is people who, in exile, have <em>given up</em> 
on God.) But, says God through the prophet (v. 18), do not wallow in the past 
to the extent of being blind to what is happening now! God is &#8220;about to 
do a new thing&#8221; (v. 19); in fact, he has already begun 
(&#8220;now&#8221;). Can&#8217;t you see it? He is providing a godly way for 
his people, protecting them and giving them sustenance (&#8220;water&#8221;, 
&#8220;drink&#8221;, v. 20). The allusion is to return from exile across the 
Arabian desert: the animals who will honour God live in the desert. Israel, the 
people whom he moulded by his instruction and discipline (&#8220;formed&#8221;, 
v. 21) are to declare to all that he is praise-worthy for his love and actions 
on their behalf. However, say vv. 22-25, the covenant relationship between God 
and his people has become one of <em>weariness</em> for, in spite of God being 
reasonable in his expectations as to how the people should honour him, the 
Israelites have ignored him. All they have done is complain and stray from his 
ways. Even so, God is merciful; he will forget their waywardness.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<hr>
<strong>Psalm 126</strong>
<p>This is a prayer for deliverance from national misfortune. Vv. 1-3 recall 
past events: it was a joyous occasion when God showed favour towards his people 
(&#8220;Zion&#8221;), almost beyond belief (although &#8220;those who 
dream&#8221; can be translated as <em>those healed</em>.) Other nations 
recognized what God had done for Israel (v. 2). Then the community prays that 
God may grant them his favour once again: may it spring up, as the parched dry 
wadis (&#8220;watercourses&#8221;, v. 4) in the &#8220;Negeb&#8221; desert rush 
with water during the seasonal rains. Perhaps v. 5 is a proverb: may our 
fortunes be reversed! V. 6 expands on v. 5. The good times remembered may be 
the Exodus or the return from Exile; if the latter, it reminds us that life in 
Palestine was difficult: it took years to restore agriculture.</p>

<b>Philippians</b>
</small><p>
<small>Paul wrote to the church at Philippi, a prosperous Roman colony in northern Greece, from prison. We
do not know whether this imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome. It appears that he was held under
house arrest. It is possible that the epistle is actually made up of three letters. It contains many personal
references, exhorts members of the Philippian church to live the Christian life and to good ethical
conduct,  introduces Timothy and Epaphroditus as his representatives, and warns against legalists and
libertines. Lastly, he thanks the Philippian community for their material support.

</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>Philippians 3:4b-14</strong>
<p>Paul has warned his readers about those who try to convince them that being 
a Christian requires acceptance of Jewish law, including circumcision. True 
circumcision is <em>of the heart</em> &#8211; and not of the 
&#8220;flesh&#8221;, i.e. following legal precepts, as in Judaism. Inner 
circumcision is what is required of us.</p>
<p>He cites his own experience as an example. In early life, he was as true to 
Judaism as anyone could be: he was circumcised; he is from the elite tribe 
(&#8220;Benjamin&#8221;, v. 5), as Jewish as one can be (&#8220;a Hebrew born 
of Hebrews&#8221;); like other Pharisees, he knew the Law well and applied it 
in daily life. He zealously persecuted Christians and faultlessly kept the Law. 
And yet, knowing Christ has made him realize that a Jewish, law-based, approach 
to God is a &#8220;loss&#8221; (vv. 7-8) for Christians: it obstructs 
God&#8217;s free gift of love. True &#8220;righteousness&#8221; (v. 9) comes 
through &#8220;faith in Christ&#8221;, not self-assessment of godliness, per 
legal precepts. He has cast aside all his Jewishness in order to realize the 
gain Christ offers (v. 8).</p>
<p>He wants to &#8220;know Christ&#8221; (v. 10) as risen and living. This 
involves attaining oneness with him through sharing his sufferings and 
participating in his death. Out of this, he will come to know &#8220;the power 
of his resurrection&#8221;. He is still working on understanding Christ 
completely (v. 12), an obligation he has for Christ has chosen him (&#8220;made 
me his own&#8221;).</p>
<p>He has made progress not on his own, but through God&#8217;s grace (v. 13); 
however he has left his past behind and eagerly seeks what lies ahead. As the 
winner in a Greek foot race was called up to receive his &#8220;prize&#8221; 
(v. 14), so he seeks God&#8217;s call to share in eternal life. 
(&#8220;Heavenly&#8221; is literally <em>upward</em>.)</p>

<small><br>
<b>John</b>
</small><p>
<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

</small>
</p></td>

<hr>
<strong>John 12:1-8</strong>
<p>Jesus has raised Martha&#8217;s and Mary&#8217;s brother, 
&#8220;Lazarus&#8221;, &#8220;from the dead&#8221;, because Martha trusts that 
Jesus is the Messiah. Many people are making the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for 
Passover. The religious authorities, aware that Jesus has performed &#8220;many 
signs&#8221; (11:47), and afraid that the Romans will destroy the Temple and 
the nation because of him, ask that anyone knowing where he is to tell them so 
they can arrest him.</p>
<p>Now Jesus returns to Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, a mere three 
kilometres east of Jerusalem. &#8220;Perfume made of pure nard&#8221; (v. 3, 
spikenard oil), was derived from the roots of a plant grown in the Himalayas. 
If the guests were reclining on couches, Jesus&#8217; feet would be accessible 
for anointing, but a respectable Jewish woman would hardly appear in public 
with her hair unbound. Judas&#8217; reaction points forward to Jesus&#8217; 
arrest (18:1-11). &#8220;Three hundred denarii&#8221; (v. 5) was close to a 
year&#8217;s wages for a labourer. Anointing was the last step before burial, 
but not for executed criminals. Perhaps in v. 7 Jesus means that Mary bought 
the perfume so as to have it ready for his burial, that what she did has a 
meaning she does not realize, and that the perfume is not wasted. Perhaps v. 8 
says: the poor are constantly in need, but Jesus&#8217; impending death is 
unique. There is a place for spontaneous love of Jesus.</p>
