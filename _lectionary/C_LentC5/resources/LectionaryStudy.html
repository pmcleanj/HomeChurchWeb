<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Isaiah</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This book can be divided into two (and possibly
three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before the exile, from
about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult times for the
southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought with Syria; the
Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and
threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as social
injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought valiantly.
Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile in Babylon.
They are filled with a message of trust and confident hope that God
will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that Chapters 56 to
66 form a third part of the book, written after the return to the
Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and despair; they berate
the people for their sin, for worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second
Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that God will soon restore
Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Isaiah 43:16-21</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Babylonian armies captured Jerusalem in 587 BC; many residents
were deported to Babylon. Chapters 40 to 55 of Isaiah were written
there in the final years of the Exile. The author had great faith in
God as intervening in human affairs when needed throughout history.
He sustains the theme of a new Exodus throughout <EM>Second Isaiah</EM>:
God will surely restore the Israelites to Judea (v. 14).</P>
<P>A prophet serves as a channel of communication between the divine
and the human realms. Today we say that <EM>history repeats itself</EM>;
this prophet would add: <EM>continually</EM>. In vv. 16-17, he
recalls God&rsquo;s saving act of enabling the Israelites to cross
the Reed (or Red) Sea: how the waters separated, providing &ldquo;a
way in the sea&rdquo;, and how the Egyptian chariots, &ldquo;army and
warrior[s]&rdquo;, were swallowed up by the waters, &ldquo;never to
rise again&rdquo; (Revised English Bible). This is who God is: he was
the motive force behind Israel&rsquo;s deliverance; he saved Israel
from slavery. (Perhaps the audience is people who, in exile, have
<EM>given up</EM> on God.) But, says God through the prophet (v. 18),
do not wallow in the past to the extent of being blind to what is
happening now! God is &ldquo;about to do a new thing&rdquo; (v. 19);
in fact, he has already begun (&ldquo;now&rdquo;). Can&rsquo;t you
see it? He is providing a godly way for his people, protecting them
and giving them sustenance (&ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;drink&rdquo;,
v. 20). The allusion is to return from exile across the Arabian
desert: the animals who will honour God live in the desert. Israel,
the people whom he moulded by his instruction and discipline
(&ldquo;formed&rdquo;, v. 21) are to declare to all that he is
praise-worthy for his love and actions on their behalf. However, say
vv. 22-25, the covenant relationship between God and his people has
become one of <EM>weariness</EM> for, in spite of God being
reasonable in his expectations as to how the people should honour
him, the Israelites have ignored him. All they have done is complain
and stray from his ways. Even so, God is merciful; he will forget
their waywardness.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Look to the Future</H4>
<P>Tradition is important. It proclaims our past and defines our
roots. But tradition for tradition's sake is as problematic as change
for change's sake. Faith demands that we cling to the wisdom of
tradition, while being open to possibilities change brings.</P>
<P>To a people that defined itself by the events of the Exodus
[16-17], God called Israel to a new openness. &quot;Forget the past,&quot;
God chided the people. &quot;Look what I am about to do.&quot;</P>
<P>Why did the savior of the Exodus tell the people to forget about
the past and look to the future? Through the prophecy of Second
Isaiah, God spoke to the exiles in Babylon, the descendants of those
who were taken before the destruction of Jerusalem. The exiles clung
to the stories of God's power in order to maintain their faith and
their national identity. But, without a capitol or a nation or a
temple for their God, the Jews in exile were without hope. Only
tradition gave them a sense of who they were.</P>
<P>But God reminded his faithful that tradition alone does not make
faith come alive. Faith means trust in God. God would create a way
home through the desert with all necessary provisions (i.e., water
from a river); the return home would be peaceful (i.e., wild animals
honor the Lord) [19-21]. Just as God acted in the Exodus, he would
act in the exiles' lives. What seemed impossible would come about;
the exiles would return home.</P>
<P>Faith without hope clings to a religion stuck in the past. Faith
that tries to be &quot;relevant&quot; to the present by rejecting the
past drifts away without roots. Both need focus upon God, his will,
and his power. Trust in God brings the past alive, gives the present
meaning, and the future hope.</P>
<P><I>How are you trying to make tradition come alive in your life?
How have you tried to pass a living tradition along to others?</I></P>

</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms
were written over many centuries, stretching from the days of
Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile (about 350 BC.)
Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments, thanksgiving
psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the book, there are
five &quot;books&quot;; there is a doxology (&quot;Blessed be ...
Amen and Amen&quot;) at the end of each book. </FONT>

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Psalm 126</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>This is a prayer for deliverance from national misfortune. Vv. 1-3
recall past events: it was a joyous occasion when God showed favour
towards his people (&ldquo;Zion&rdquo;), almost beyond belief
(although &ldquo;those who dream&rdquo; can be translated as <EM>those
healed</EM>.) Other nations recognized what God had done for Israel
(v. 2). Then the community prays that God may grant them his favour
once again: may it spring up, as the parched dry wadis
(&ldquo;watercourses&rdquo;, v. 4) in the &ldquo;Negeb&rdquo; desert
rush with water during the seasonal rains. Perhaps v. 5 is a proverb:
may our fortunes be reversed! V. 6 expands on v. 5. The good times
remembered may be the Exodus or the return from Exile; if the latter,
it reminds us that life in Palestine was difficult: it took years to
restore agriculture.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Philippians</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Paul wrote to the church at Philippi, a prosperous
Roman colony in northern Greece, from prison. We do not know whether
this imprisonment was in Ephesus or in Rome. It appears that he was
held under house arrest. It is possible that the epistle is actually
made up of three letters. It contains many personal references,
exhorts members of the Philippian church to live the Christian life
and to good ethical conduct, introduces Timothy and Epaphroditus as
his representatives, and warns against legalists and libertines.
Lastly, he thanks the Philippian community for their material
support. </FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Philippians 3:4b-14</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Paul has warned his readers about those who try to convince them
that being a Christian requires acceptance of Jewish law, including
circumcision. True circumcision is <EM>of the heart</EM> &ndash; and
not of the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo;, i.e. following legal precepts, as in
Judaism. Inner circumcision is what is required of us.</P>
<P>He cites his own experience as an example. In early life, he was
as true to Judaism as anyone could be: he was circumcised; he is from
the elite tribe (&ldquo;Benjamin&rdquo;, v. 5), as Jewish as one can
be (&ldquo;a Hebrew born of Hebrews&rdquo;); like other Pharisees, he
knew the Law well and applied it in daily life. He zealously
persecuted Christians and faultlessly kept the Law. And yet, knowing
Christ has made him realize that a Jewish, law-based, approach to God
is a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; (vv. 7-8) for Christians: it obstructs God&rsquo;s
free gift of love. True &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (v. 9) comes
through &ldquo;faith in Christ&rdquo;, not self-assessment of
godliness, per legal precepts. He has cast aside all his Jewishness
in order to realize the gain Christ offers (v. 8).</P>
<P>He wants to &ldquo;know Christ&rdquo; (v. 10) as risen and living.
This involves attaining oneness with him through sharing his
sufferings and participating in his death. Out of this, he will come
to know &ldquo;the power of his resurrection&rdquo;. He is still
working on understanding Christ completely (v. 12), an obligation he
has for Christ has chosen him (&ldquo;made me his own&rdquo;).</P>
<P>He has made progress not on his own, but through God&rsquo;s grace
(v. 13); however he has left his past behind and eagerly seeks what
lies ahead. As the winner in a Greek foot race was called up to
receive his &ldquo;prize&rdquo; (v. 14), so he seeks God&rsquo;s call
to share in eternal life. (&ldquo;Heavenly&rdquo; is literally
<EM>upward</EM>.)</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">A Question of Comfort Levels</H4>
<P><B>Popular Translation</B></P>
<P><B>8-9 I truly believe everything I have right now is totally
worthless. It&rsquo;s all trash! Who I know is so much better, my
Lord, Jesus Christ! When I have Jesus in my heart, I&rsquo;m at peace
with God. This peace does not come from simply following God&rsquo;s
Law. No, it comes from my faith in Jesus. 10 Right now, I know Jesus
and the power that raised him from the dead. I also know some of what
he suffered and the way he died. God wants me to experience this 11
so I, too, can rise from the dead with everyone else.</B></P>
<P><B>12 I haven&rsquo;t reached my goal. And God isn&rsquo;t
finished with me. So I pursue it, so I can hold onto it. After all,
Jesus is already holding onto me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I don&rsquo;t
really think I have a firm grasp on it. But, I do know this. I want
to forget everything that&rsquo;s in the past and reach out to those
things in front of me. 14 I have the prize in my sights. I am
pursuing it. Through Jesus Christ, God is calling me up to himself.</B></P>
<P><B>Literal Translation</B></P>
<P><B>8 But rather, I consider everything to be a loss because of the
superior knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, because of whom I lost
everything, and I consider (it all) rubbish, so that I might gain
Christ 9 and found in him, not having my righteousness from the Law
but through faith in Christ, the righteousness of God (built) upon
faith, 10 as I know him and the power of his resurrection and the
fellowship with his sufferings, being conformed to his death 11 if
possible I can reach the resurrection of the dead.</B></P>
<P><B>12 Not that I already received (the goal I treasure), or I have
already been made perfect (with it), but I pursue (it) if to obtain
(it), about which I have been obtained by Christ [Jesus]. 13
Brothers, I myself do not think (that I have come) to obtain (it).
But, (there is) one (thing), on the one hand, forgetting the (things)
previous, and, on the other hand, stretching forth toward the
(things) in front (of us), 14 by the bulls-eye, I pursue the prize,
the call upward of God through Christ Jesus.</B></P>
<P>3:8 &ldquo;superior knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord&rdquo; In
this sense, knowledge was not the mastery over facts of faith, but a
knowledge that came from intimacy with Christ. Paul emphasized
relationship, not doctrine.</P>
<P>3:3-11 This long sentence actually has two main clauses that
mirror each other: 1) &ldquo;I consider everything to be loss...&rdquo;
and 2) &ldquo;I consider (it all) rubbish...&rdquo; The explanatory
phrases also mirror each other: 2) &ldquo;because of the superior
knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord&rdquo; and 2) &ldquo; so that I
might gain Christ and found in him.&rdquo; In other words, Paul
downplayed his present life and its pleasures; he played up his
relationship with Christ. For Paul, there was no comparison between
the two.</P>
<P>What was Paul to gain from his relationship with Christ? Three
things. First, a sense of right relationship with God (i.e.,
&ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; or &ldquo;justification&rdquo;). Second,
a transcendent hope that made sense of his life&rsquo;s toil and his
enemies&rsquo; hatred (fellowship with the sufferings of Christ);
this hope was based on a dynamic, intimate relationship with Christ
(knowing Christ and the power of his resurrection). Third, a goal:
participation in the resurrection of the dead.</P>
<P>3:10 &ldquo;being conformed to his death&rdquo; Who or what was
conforming Paul to the death of Jesus? Two answers were possible: the
sufferings Paul knew or God himself. As the note above stated, Paul
used the sufferings of Christ as an analogy with the opposition and
persecution he encountered in his ministry. As Paul suffered, he
identified with the sufferings of Christ. In fact, Paul might have
thought suffering for the gospel was part of the price for preaching
the gospel, just as the resurrection represented the promise of
general resurrection at the end of time. However, whose will did Paul
fulfill in the preaching of the gospel and enduring persecution?
God&rsquo;s, of course. (See the popular translation.)</P>
<P>3:14 &ldquo;by the bulls-eye&rdquo; The &ldquo;bulls-eye&rdquo;
was literally a focal point. It was used by the watchman or the
bowman.</P>
<P>How do we define preaching the gospel? A cynical, but popular
definition is &ldquo;to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the
comfortable.&rdquo; If you were ever at the end of your rope and
needed Good News, you know the definition is true. If you were ever
comfortable in your lifestyle and the words of the preacher made you
uncomfortable, even angry, you know the definition is true.</P>
<P>Paul certainly knew the phrase was true. In fact, he lived
discomfort as he preached. Discomfort put his life in perspective.
His present circumstances were nothing compared with his commitment
to the Lord. The benefits of faith so outdistanced the benefits of
momentary pleasures. In these verse he listed three benefits: feeling
justified before God, a personal relationship (i.e., knowledge) of
the Risen Lord, and an experience of the power that raised him from
the dead (the Spirit).</P>
<P>But, while Paul preached the Gospel, its promise was not fully
realized in his life. That would wait until the end of life or the
end of time. Nonetheless, Paul yearned for its fulfillment. The end
of Paul&rsquo;s mission would ultimately lead to his death. And his
glory. God calling him home in Christ.</P>
<P>When we read the Good News or hear it preached to us, it should
comfort us in need and move us when we feel too comfortable. But, the
Good News should motivate us to look beyond our present existence. It
should focus our sights on God&rsquo;s call upward, to himself.</P>
<P>If it does not, then we have lethargic or hard hearts. That should
be a sign we are in real need of the Gospel.</P>
<P><I>Do you consider your life good? Or do you yearn for more? What
is the content of that &ldquo;more?&rdquo; Where does God fit into
your yearnings?</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no
attempt to give a chronological account of the life of Jesus (which
the other gospels do, to a degree), but rather &quot;...these things
are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the
Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life

miracles, to help in this process. </FONT>

<P><STRONG>John 12:1-8</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Jesus has raised Martha&rsquo;s and Mary&rsquo;s brother,
&ldquo;Lazarus&rdquo;, &ldquo;from the dead&rdquo;, because Martha
trusts that Jesus is the Messiah. Many people are making the
pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Passover. The religious authorities,
aware that Jesus has performed &ldquo;many signs&rdquo; (11:47), and
afraid that the Romans will destroy the Temple and the nation because
of him, ask that anyone knowing where he is to tell them so they can
arrest him.</P>
<P>Now Jesus returns to Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, a mere three
kilometres east of Jerusalem. &ldquo;Perfume made of pure nard&rdquo;
(v. 3, spikenard oil), was derived from the roots of a plant grown in
the Himalayas. If the guests were reclining on couches, Jesus&rsquo;
feet would be accessible for anointing, but a respectable Jewish
woman would hardly appear in public with her hair unbound. Judas&rsquo;
reaction points forward to Jesus&rsquo; arrest (18:1-11). &ldquo;Three
hundred denarii&rdquo; (v. 5) was close to a year&rsquo;s wages for a
labourer. Anointing was the last step before burial, but not for
executed criminals. Perhaps in v. 7 Jesus means that Mary bought the
perfume so as to have it ready for his burial, that what she did has
a meaning she does not realize, and that the perfume is not wasted.
Perhaps v. 8 says: the poor are constantly in need, but Jesus&rsquo;
impending death is unique. There is a place for spontaneous love of
Jesus.</P>

<P><I>Who is the most honorable person you know? Why is this person

<P>What makes a person honorable? Great deeds and great commitments?
Wisdom and humility? Trustworthiness and compassion? A great
reputation? There are these and many other ways to define an
honorable person. Striving for the right. The right way to act. The
right way to live. This person is the opposite of the sinner.</P>
<P>What turns a sinner into an individual of honor? Presented with a

honorable leaders of his community. And he gave the possibility of
change to the sinner with a simple twist in his point of view.</P>

<P><B>After Jesus taught the crowd, everyone went home.</B></P>
<P><B>1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early the next
morning, Jesus arrived at the Temple. The people crowded around him.
So he sat down and began to teach them. 3 Suddenly, the religious
leaders brought a woman who was found being unfaithful to her
husband. They stood her before everyone. 4 Then they said to Jesus,
&quot;Teacher, we caught this woman doing something that broke God's
Law! She was being unfaithful to her husband. In God's Law, Moses
told us to stone such women to death. What do you say we should do?&quot;
6 They said this to pressure Jesus so he might say something they
could use against him. But, Jesus bent over and wrote in the sand
with his finger. 7 They kept asking him over and over.</B></P>
<P><B>So, Jesus straightened up and said, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Let
the person who has never broken God's Law throw the first stone at
her.&quot;</FONT> 8 Again, Jesus bent over and wrote in the sand. 9
One by one, starting with the leaders, everyone who heard Jesus
answer walked away. Soon, only Jesus and the woman were left. 10 So
Jesus straightened up. <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Madame, isn't
there anyone here who says you're guilty?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
<P><B>11 &quot;No one,&quot; the woman responded.</B></P>
<P><B>12 <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Well, I don't say your guilty
either,&quot;</FONT> Jesus told her. <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Go
your way. But don't break the Law again.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
<P>Challenged with a test, Jesus turned popular logic on its head.
Those who condemned were dishonorable. While the sinner was offered a
change at honor.</P>

<P><B>(After Jesus taught the crowd, everyone went home.)</B></P>
<P><B>1 But Jesus journeyed to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn, HE
arrived at the Temple. The people approached HIM, and, having sat, HE
taught them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman having
been caught in adultery. Standing her in (their) midst, 4 they said
to HIM, &quot;Teacher, this woman has been caught in a self-chosen
act of committing adultery. 5 In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone
such (women). So, what do YOU say?&quot; 6 Pressuring him, they said
this so that they might have (a basis) to accuse HIM. But Jesus, bent
down, was writing with his finger in the dirt. 7 As they remained
asking HIM, HE straightened up and said to them,<FONT COLOR="#f00000">
&quot;Let the sinless among throw the first stone.&quot;</FONT> 8
Again, bent down, he was writing on the earth. 9 Those hearing (HIM)
went away, one by one, having begun with the elders. HE was left
alone, the woman being in (his) midst. 10 Straightening up, JESUS
said to her, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;Woman, where are they? Does
no one condemn you?&quot;</FONT> 11 She said &quot;No one.&quot;
JESUS said, <FONT COLOR="#f00000">&quot;I do not condemn you
(either). Go. From now (on) no longer sin.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
<P>8:3-4 The woman in the story was married, but had relations with
another man. We can make this assumption on two grounds. First, the
Torah only lists adultery as one married person having relations with
another who was not the spouse. The non-married did not violate these
tenets of the Law. Second, a wife was considered to be the property
of her husband without rights of her own. Relations with another man,
even if woman was raped, shamed the husband. To vindicate his honor,
the man could have his wife stoned in public. The Greek suggests the
woman willingly committed the act. So, in the eyes of the accusers,
she deserved the punishment under the Law.</P>
<P>8:7 According to Deuteronomy 17:6-7, the witnesses to the crime
were throw the first stones, as a means to finish their accusations.
The Law required two or more witnesses to support an accusation.
Jesus added a condition to the Law, the sinless accusers could throw
the first stone. Of course, that was impossible. Since no one could
keep the Law perfectly, no one could be the perfect (sinless)
witness. Sinners accusing others of sin was the height of hypocracy.</P>
<P>8:10 &quot;Woman&quot; is a title of respect in Semite cultures.</P>
<P>In this beautiful story, the Pharisees challenged Jesus with a
moral dilemma. The Jewish leaders pitted the fulfillment of God's Law
(tradition) against compassion (present need). If Jesus chose
fulfillment of the Law, he would be seen as cold-hearted in the eyes
of those he ministered to: the sinners. But, if he chose compassion,
he would be seen as one who disrespected the Law and was &quot;soft
on&quot; immorality; the general populace would renounce him and the
leaders would have sufficient grounds to prosecute him. This was a
tight &quot;open and shut&quot; case for the Pharisees and a losing
situation for Jesus.</P>
<P>But Jesus chose an unexpected middle route; he acted apathetic by
doodling on the ground and turned the question back on them. The
doodling may refer to a Greek text of Jeremiah 17:13: &quot;...may
those who turn away from the Lord be written on the earth...&quot;
The names of the saved, as the ancients believed, would be written in
heaven. [6]</P>
<P>By giving the sinless permission to carry out the Law, Jesus
caught the Pharisees at their own game. To throw a stone at this
point would be the sin of pride. The persecutors would have the
audacity to act in God's place; this would be blasphemous in the eyes
of the people, since no one was without sin. No wonder the elders
left first in shame! [7-9]</P>
<P>Possibly the greatest irony of the story could be found in the
adulterous woman. The woman, caught in the act, stood before Jesus
un-judged; that would be the way Jesus would leave the woman. Without
judgment, the charge of sin could not be leveled against her, she was
truly &quot;sinless&quot; in the eyes of the Lord. Jesus simply told
her not to sin again. [10-11]</P>
<P>(This story has been controversial, not in content, but in place.
Remove these passages, and John 7:14-8:57 flows smoothly. Some
manuscripts place this narrative at the end of Luke. Regardless where
the narrative was placed, the Church has always recognized it as
canonical. The beauty of the passage and the message were uniquely
Christian even from the earliest times.)</P>
<P>Catechism Theme: The Sixth Commandment and Chastity (CCC
2392-2395)</P>
<P>Instead of condemning the woman, Jesus invited her to return to a
sinless life, a life of honor. Her sin was adultery. Her duty not to
sin again was more than avoiding a situation of temptation. She was
to become chaste.</P>
<P>The woman sinned against the sixth commandment. What does the
sixth commandment teach us? The sixth commandment teaches us that
love is the basic duty for everyone. Jesus tells us to love God above
everything else, and to love others as ourselves, whether they are
male or female. The equality of love calls us to respect others'
dignity and to accept ourselves, especially own sexual identity.
(2392, 2393)</P>
<P>Jesus invited her to return to a chaste life. What is &quot;chastity?
Chastity is the virtue of self-control in sexual matters. Because
sexuality includes our psychological, physical, moral, and social
worlds, chastity helps us to integrate these areas in a healthy way.
Chastity is more than saying &quot;no&quot; to sexual thoughts or
desires; chastity points to the goal of sexual expression, the
lifelong commitment of marriage. Everyone is called to live a chaste
life, whether married or not. (2394, 2395, 2394)</P>
<P><I>Have you ever known someone who changed their life around? From
the sinner to the honorable person? What caused the change?</I></P>
<P>How many times have we stood &quot;sinless&quot; before the Lord?
How many times could we claim honor in the eyes of God? Never? Our
past might condemn us, but before God we are innocent. Like the woman
in the passage, we stand without sin if we are willing to receive the
gift of grace. For, only faith in God's grace convinces us that the
Father will allow us to be free from sin. We have honor before him,
but only as his children. Let us revel in that place of honor he has
graciously bestowed on us.</P>
<P><I>In what areas of your life are overly critical? How can you see
these areas through God's eyes? How does this change in view affect
your view of life? </I>
