Statement: "I am about to do a new thing." Questions: How do you define
&#8220;extravagance&#8221;? How would your family define it? How would your
congregation define it? How would you and your family and your
congregation define &#8220;waste&#8221;? What sorts of limits have you placed on
what you spend or give away or use that define what is &#8220;reasonable,&#8221;
and what is &#8220;excessive&#8221;? Paul speaks of &#8220;loss&#8221; and &#8220;rubbish&#8221; in today&#8217;s
reading from Philippians when he places all his accomplishments and
credentials before the &#8220;surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my
Lord.&#8221; Nothing he has done and nothing he has been can measure up to
knowing Christ and the power of his resurrection. This conviction
enables him to &#8220;press on&#8221; to make his goal of gaining Christ &#8220;who has
made me his own.&#8221; And so he strains forward to what lies ahead. What do
we think lies ahead, in this age of terror alerts and economic
dis-ease? Do we see beyond passing conditions and indicators to a
greater reality? On the other hand, can we look so easily beyond the
economic realities that press hard on the day-to-day realities of so
many in our midst? What does it mean to &#8220;know Christ&#8221; and to care that
each of our brothers and sisters has enough bread to eat and a roof
over their head? What does &#8220;enough&#8221; mean to you? To us as a church?
Then, read the story from the Gospel of John. A woman takes an
expensive jar of perfume and extravagantly pours it out on Jesus&#8217; feet
in a heartfelt gesture toward the future, a broken-hearted sense of
what is to come at the end of the journey to Jerusalem. What are her
feelings? Did she think about it carefully ahead of time, calculating
the cost and making the commitment? How do we think about our giving
and our gestures of love and generosity, the things that come from
deepest within our hearts? Do we calculate and figure, or do we give
extravagantly? Do we hold back our words at moments that may need our
courage; do we hold back our feelings when others need to know that we
care; do we hold back our &#8220;stuff,&#8221; our expensive perfume and costly
treasures, when all around us are sisters and brothers who may need
bread and milk, jobs and houses? How do you think Mary felt the next
day? Did she clean up the remnants of the perfume, changed in any way
by her act? She had &#8220;seized the day,&#8221; sensing she would not have Jesus
much longer so close at hand. How is the day and the moment before us
in such a way that our acts of extravagant generosity can wait no
longer?

circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the

that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness
of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in

Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of
Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for
him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.
Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&#8217;
feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the
fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the
one who was about to betray him), said, &#8220;Why was this perfume not sold
for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&#8221; (He said
this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief;
he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus
said, &#8220;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the
day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not
always have me.&#8221;

Unlike some pastor&#8217;s children, Erin Balleine did not follow her
parent&#8217;s footsteps into the ministry. But she didn&#8217;t choose a lucrative
secular career, either. After college, Erin secured an internship in
the Washington, D.C. office of the United Church of Christ&#8217;s Justice
and Witness Ministries. There her efforts to involve UCC youth and
young adults in the Coalition of Immokalee, Florida, Workers&#8217; Taco Bell
boycott caught the attention of the National Farm Worker Ministry and
they offered her a job. After completing her year in Washington, Erin
moved to Miami, Florida, to work with the National Farm Worker
Ministry, educating faith groups in the Dade County area on farm worker
issues, and urging them to become active in supporting farm worker
campaigns.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
The United Church of Christ&#8217;s commitment to justice for farm workers
goes back at least thirty years to the Ninth General Synod in 1973,
when a plane-load of delegates flew to California to stand and pray in
solidarity with Caesar Chavez and the striking grape pickers. That
commitment has been reaffirmed many times since, most recently when the
23rd General Synod endorsed the Taco Bell boycott in 2001. It was not
an action taken lightly by the delegates. But when they learned about
the tomato pickers in Immokalee they could not do otherwise. These farm
laborers earn just forty cents for each 32-pound bucket they fill&#8211;the
same wage that has been paid by local growers since 1978. Taco Bell,
which buys those tomatoes, refuses to pay the penny more a pound that
would enable the growers to nearly double the workers&#8217; wages.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
The Congregational Church of Coral Gables, Florida, also has a long
record of social justice ministries. The congregation provided the
grant to the National Farm Worker Ministry that funds Erin&#8217;s position.
But her educational and advocacy efforts are larger than the United
Church of Christ. The National Farm Worker Ministry is an interfaith
organization that brings together forty denominations, state councils
of churches, religious orders and congregations to support farm workers
as they organize for improved living and working conditions. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
Thus, when Erin Balleine talks to groups about the farm workers&#8217; low
wages, substandard housing, and exposure to pesticides, her listeners
may as well be Presbyterians, Mennonites, or Unitarians. But when she
urges them to contact their state representatives, join a candle-light
vigil, or boycott Taco Bell and the Mt. Olive Pickle Company, whatever
their denomination they become part of an interfaith movement united in
the quest for justice and dignity for the men and women&#8211;and children,
too&#8211;who labor in the fields.<!-- END SUNDAY BULLETIN BACK PAGE -->

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a
Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and
liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister
to read all of the lessons.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" sans="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the
lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or
recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is
appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way.
The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with
refrains and music.</font></font></p><p>
