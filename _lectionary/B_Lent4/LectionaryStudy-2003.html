rejection, and final suffering. We walk with Christ through the days
of Lent by prayer and fasting. -- in this case the discovery of who
Jesus is. Review our memory scripture:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened,
and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: and there came a
voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. And immediately the spirit driveth him into the
wilderness.<BR>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted
of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
unto him.<BR>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<BR>And saying,
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye,
and believe the gospel.</I>

is like Home-work, except that it is done in the pews, instead of
being done at home. Because it is focussed on the readings (as the
sermon, presumably, also is) it can be done during the sermon to help
the listener concentrate. Or, it can be done while waiting for
everyone else to finish their communion. It isn't done during
prayers, or hymns, or the readings, because</FONT></P>
