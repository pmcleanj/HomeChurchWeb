<h2><strong>Who Do You Look Up To?</strong></h2>
<p>Think back to when you were a child.&nbsp;   Can you recall the various individuals that you <em>looked up</em> to?&nbsp;   Perhaps they included an older sibling, a favorite teacher, a star athlete,   or even a grandparent.&nbsp; To <em>look up</em>
to someone was to hold them in a place of high esteem.&nbsp; It was to
extend to that person a level of admiration and trust that entailed
granting him or her a place of authority in our life. Often it meant we
wanted to emulate him or her, as that individual served as a sort of
role model for us.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there still people in your life that   you <em>look up</em> to today?&nbsp; Now that we are older we tend to   use words like <em>admire</em>, or <em>respect</em>.&nbsp; Could that be   because of the simple fact that we have <u>literally</u> grown up?&nbsp;   Something about the metaphor seems unfitting when you describe a 6&#8217;6&#8221;   man as <em>looking up </em>to his 5&#8217;4&#8221; grandmother.&nbsp; But perhaps   it is more than simply an issue about height.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps as we grow older we become less impressionable and, instead,
more self-centered.&nbsp; Some of this progression is healthy.&nbsp; As
we grow older and our physical and mental capacities continue to
develop and mature, a healthy person will grow more centered in his or
her sense of identity.&nbsp; Maintaining a stable sense of identity is
important for one&#8217;s mental health.&nbsp; If we do not ever fully
develop our internal sense of identity, then we will continually be
looking to others to define who we are.&nbsp; This continual dance to
emulate others will ultimately leave us exhausted and confused about
who we really are.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, at the other end of the spectrum, if our attention
becomes entirely inward looking and we lose our ability to <em>look up</em>
then our potentially centered identity becomes, instead,
self-centered.&nbsp; We become rigid in our thinking and our ways of
being in the world.&nbsp; Our ability to experience mutuality in
relationships becomes limited by our unwillingness to entertain a new
perspective.&nbsp; Our capacity to experience trust becomes diminished,
as we grow fearful of people whose ideas are different from ours.&nbsp;
Having lost the ability to trust, it&#8217;s possible that we might still be
able to hold <em>respect</em> for another individual, but it&#8217;s doubtful   that we will ever find ourselves <em>looking up</em> to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>This lesson
starts out with the Israelites&#8217; growing impatience with God and with
Moses.&nbsp; God sends the poisonous snakes as a result of the sin of
their &#8220;unwillingness to trust God to deliver them and to fulfill God&#8217;s
commitments to bring them into the land.&#8221;1&nbsp; Rather than <em>looking up</em>
to God and trusting in God&#8217;s promises, the Israelites become inward
looking and begin challenging God&#8217;s plan with their own desires.&nbsp;
In becoming self-centered they lose their vision and their faith in
God&#8217;s word.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      <p>We can find irony in this
text as well, as the very thing that threatens to kill the Israelites
becomes a symbol of healing for them.&nbsp; Having been bitten by
poisonous snakes, they are called to <em>look up</em> to the bronze
snake in order to be healed.&nbsp; Here again we see symbols of life
and death intertwined.&nbsp; As one author writes, &#8220;The cross in John&#8217;s
gospel, like the pole with the bronze serpent, signifies both the
poison of death as well as the life giving power of God for all those
who believe and look [up] to God for healing and new life.&#8221;2&nbsp; <em>Looking up</em>
at the bronze snake heals the Israelites from their sin because it is
an act of faith that delivers them from their self-centeredness.&nbsp; <em>Looking   up</em>
symbolizes allowing ourselves to trust in God&#8217;s plan and God&#8217;s
promises, enabling us to live the quality of life God intends for
us.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>In
the second reading the theme of transitioning from death to life
continues.&nbsp; Again we see that God&#8217;s love for us is the very heart
and source of the gift of grace (Jn. 3:16, Eph. 2:4).&nbsp; It is by
God&#8217;s grace that we are saved.&nbsp; We need only <em>look up</em> to God in faith in order to receive God&#8217;s promises.&nbsp;</p>
	  
	  <p>When we <em>look up</em>
to Christ we become more attuned to our identity as a created child of
God.&nbsp; &#8220;For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for
good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life&#8221; (Eph.
2:10).&nbsp; When we open ourselves up to following God&#8217;s plan for our
life, we allow ourselves the possibility of experiencing the full depth
and richness of what God intended our life to be; thus, we begin to
experience God&#8217;s gracious gift of eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel Reading</h4>
	  <p>The lectionary texts for today center   around the significance of <em>looking up</em>:&nbsp; it is an act of   faith.&nbsp; In the first reading the Israelites are called to <em>look   up</em>
to the bronze serpent in order to be healed and to escape their
impending death brought on by the poisonous snakebites.&nbsp; Here in
the gospel reading Jesus draws a direct parallel from this story to the
significance of the lifting up of Christ.&nbsp; Salvation comes to
those who <em>look up </em> to the Crucified and Risen One.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>In
John&#8217;s gospel Jesus&#8217; lifting up refers both to his glory as well as his
crucifixion.&nbsp; The irony of the cross&#8212;how death is bound up with
new life&#8212;is central to John&#8217;s gospel.&nbsp; When we <em>look up</em> to the crucified and risen Christ   we receive the gift of eternal life.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>In
John&#8217;s gospel eternal life is used to describe a fundamental change in
our present existence.&nbsp; It is not solely a future-oriented
possibility.&nbsp; It is something we begin to experience in the here
and now.&nbsp; When we <em>look up</em> to Christ we are engaging in
an act of faith.&nbsp; When we extend our trust and grant Christ a
place of authority in our lives, we begin to taste the fruits of
eternal life.&nbsp; When we <em>look up</em> to Christ we begin to
develop an identity anchored in God&#8217;s promises, an identity that
centers on being a child of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;Who are some of the people that you have looked up to over
the course of your life?&nbsp; What were some of the qualities they
possessed that encouraged you to look up to them?&nbsp; Are there
things in your life today, other than people, which you look up
to?&nbsp; What priorities in your life do you grant authority to?&nbsp;
(i.e. money, success, joy, etc.)</p>
<p>2.What do you think <em>looking     up</em> to Christ entails?&nbsp;
What are three tangible examples that might help illustrate what this
act of faith can look like in our everyday lives?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Can you think of any areas in your life in which you have
failed to look up to Christ?&nbsp; What sins might you need to confess
in order to regain your freedom to look upward?</p>
<p>4. What does it mean to you that you are a Child of God?&nbsp; How
might being a Child of God play a profound role in your sense of
identity, either currently or in the future?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.  What are some tangible ways     in which we begin to experience eternal life when we are <em>looking     up</em> to Christ and living in accordance with God&#8217;s plan for our     lives?&nbsp;</p>
