Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they

<P ALIGN=LEFT>I would love to see this passage done in church as a
skit! The reader of the gospel would bet up, as normal, to read. Just
as she starts 'The Holy Gospel according to Saint Mark', three or
four street-dressed teens would come in down the main aisle, talking.
Their voices would get louder and more disruptive, until, as they
reach the chancel, the one in front would turn around and say 'What
are you arguing about?' Then he would fetch one of the parish
children (you'd have to arrange this with the parents first, and be
well acquainted with the child), draw her into the circle of teens,
and say hoever would be first among you must be last  and so on. It
could be very simply done, with no props or costumes, just the words
of scripture suddenly come live.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
