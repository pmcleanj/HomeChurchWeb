<B>Exodus</B>
<P>
Exodus is the second book of the Old Testament, and is part of the Pentateuch,
the first five books of the Bible. Jews refer to these books as "The Torah".
At times, they are referred to as "The Law", although "Torah" means <I>teaching</I>.
Exodus centres on the rescue of God's chosen people from captivity in Egypt
and the making of the great covenant, or agreement with God, at Mount Sinai.

<STRONG>Exodus 3:1-15</STRONG>
<P>Moses has been forced to flee Egypt because his murder of an Egyptian slave-master became known. He fled to the Sinai peninsula (&#8220;Midian&#8221;), and married Zipporah, daughter of Jethro (or Ruel.) Back in Egypt, the Pharaoh (probably Seti 
I) has died, and those under the yoke of slavery have become restive.</P>
<P>Moses is shepherding &#8220;beyond the wilderness&#8221;: a mysterious place like the <EM>deep in the forest</EM> of fairy tales. Near Mount Sinai (&#8220;Horeb&#8221;) a messenger from God (or God himself) appears to him in the form of fire 
&#8211; a symbol implying passion, purity, light, mystery and (here) not inextinguishable. Moses is curious (v.

follows is the archetype for the calling of a prophet. God appears to the person and urges him to return to his people and serve as his spokesman, despite any opposition he may encounter, and his own shortcomings. As we find with other prophets 
(e.g. Jeremiah, Jonah), Moses is reluctant: in fact, he refuses four times! He has reason for not returning to Egypt, and yet he does return, because he believes that he is sent by God. Moses, like Abraham and Samuel, acknowledges God's call by 
saying &#8220;Here I am&#8221; (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Exodus+3%3A4" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">4</A>). Removing one's footwear (v.

the ancient Near East. God identifies himself as the God of the patriarchs, to whom he made promises of protection in return for loyalty (v.

to Canaan. (The peoples in v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Exodus+3%3A8" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">8</A> were 
indigenous to Palestine at the time.) God gives Moses his commission (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Exodus+3%3A10" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">10</A>) but Moses presents an excuse: 
&#8220;who am I&#8221; (v. <A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Exodus+3%3A11" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">11</A>) to 
do this? God answers: &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; (v.

Moses raises another objection: what do I tell people your name is? (v. 
<A HREF="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&word=Exodus+3%3A13" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">13</A>) To know someone's name was to 
have power over him, or at least understand his very being. God's answer is enigmatic and the Hebrew is unclear: it can be translated <EM>He who causes to be what comes into existence</EM> or it may indicate presence, and be intentionally vague. (No 
one has power over God.) Moses is commanded to tell the Israelites that his title is YHWH or Yahweh (in Hebrew), or &#8220; L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>&#8221; (v.

<B>Psalms</B>
<P>
Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<B>Romans</B>
<P>
Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, although not the first to be
written. Paul wrote it to the church at Rome, which included both Jews and
Gentiles. His primary theme is the basics of the good news of Christ,
salvation for all people. The book was probably written in 57 AD, when Paul
was near the end of his third missionary journey around the Eastern
Mediterranean. It is unusual in that it was written to a church that Paul had
not visited.

This gospel is the first in the New Testament, but it was probably the second
to be written. Scholars recognize that it borrows material from Mark, and from
a <I>sayings</I> source containing sayings of Jesus and known as Q (for <I>Quelle</I>, German for <I>source</I>).
The author shows an understanding of Jewish culture and religion not found in
the other gospels. It was probably written about 60 to 70 AD, possibly for a

<STRONG>Matthew 16:21-28</STRONG>
<P>Jesus has been instructing his disciples about the mission they are to carry out on his behalf, about telling the good news. Now his message to them shifts to teaching them that he, the Messiah, must (per God's will and purpose), undergo great 
suffering &#8211; something inconceivable to most Jews. (&#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; is the city where prophets are put to death.) Peter grasped that Jesus is &#8220;the Messiah, the Son of the living God&#8221;, (v.

the impending death of the Messiah, rather than his direct ascendance to glory.</P>

followers, we must devote the whole thrust of our lives to God (&#8220;deny themselves&#8221;), not reserving any part for our personal goals. Be willing to give up physical comfort and safety, accepting martyrdom if necessary. This approach to life 
will lead to true life with God. V.

nothing that one can get or &#8220;gain&#8221; now measures up to what God will give to the faithful in the time to come. There will be a reckoning, when Jesus comes in glory at the end of time. Some who hear these words now will still be alive at
