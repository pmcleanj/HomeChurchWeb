<h4>Steps of Evangelization</h4>
<p class="bluetext"><b>Literal Translation</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>5 Philip, having gone down into a city of
Samaria, preached (about) the Christ to them. 6 (Almost) as one, the
crowds held onto the (words) spoken by Philip, in (their eagerness) to
hear (his words) and to see the signs he was performing. 7 For many
having unclean spirits were being released, crying out (in) loud voice;
many having been paralyzed and the lame were healed. 8 Great joy
occurred in that city.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext"><b>14 The apostles in Jerusalem, having heard that
Samaria had welcomed the word of God, sent (the Samaritans) Peter and
John, 15 who, having come down, prayed about (the Samaritan believers),
so that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 16 For (the Spirit) had not
yet come down upon any of them, but they were (followers), only having
been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 (Peter and John) set
hands on them and (the Samaritan followers) received the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
<p class="indent">8:5 Samaritans also anticipated a Messiah figure. They called him "Taheb," which meant "one who restores."</p>
<p class="indent">8:7 "many having unclean spirits were being released,
crying out (in) loud voice" Although the subject of the sentence are
the possessed, the verb "were coming out" referred to exorcized demons.
The screams were the demons, not the possessed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this reading, Luke related steps of evangelization that reflected Peter's call in Acts 2:38:</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Turn (your) heart-mind away (from sin), let each
of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of
your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p class="bodytext">In his journey to Samaria, Philip preached and
supported his message with healings and exorcisms. In the light of
8:16, the Samaritans were baptized. Whether Philip baptized them (as he
did with the Ethiopian in 8:38) or not, cannot be determined. The call
the metanoia (with supporting signs) and baptism were accomplished. The
third step, reception of the Holy Spirit, came through Peter and Mark,
who were sent from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Notice the attraction to Philip's message was
supported by charisms given to him by the Spirit. In other words,
effective evangelization required cooperation with the Spirit. And the
end result of evangelization is reception of the Spirit by those who
hear the message and see its evidence. Spirit-led pointed to
Spirit-filled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this Easter time, we might ask how we can
effectively evangelize. Take this reading to heart. Pray that the
Spirit might lead you and use your talents to support your words. And
pray the Spirit might fall upon your audience, even if only one person
is "in the house."</p>
