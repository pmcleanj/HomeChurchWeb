<b>Acts</b>
</small><p>
<small>This book is the sequel to the gospel according to Luke. Beginning with Jesus' 
ascension, Luke tells the story of the beginnings of the church. By no means 
a comprehensive history, it does however describe the spread of the church 
from Jerusalem to all of Palestine, and as far as Greece. The episodes he 
reports show how Christianity arose out of Judaism. He shows us something of 
the struggles the church underwent in accepting Gentiles as members. The Holy 
Spirit guides and strengthens the church as it spreads through much of the 
Roman Empire.

<strong>Acts 17:22-31</strong>
<p>On his second missionary journey, Paul has crossed Asia Minor
(modern Turkey) and has arrived in Athens, a city known for its
interest in the divine and its openness to discussion of philosophies
and religions. He argues for Christianity in the synagogue and in the
marketplace. Epicurean and Stoic philosophers see him as dabbling in
philosophy and proclaiming &#8220;foreign divinities&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A18" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">18</a>), of Jesus and the resurrection 
(possibly thought by them to be a god). He is invited to join in philosophical discussions at the &#8220;Areopagus&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A19" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">19</a>)
on edge of the marketplace. He presents the good news to a people of a
culture very different from the one in which it was first proclaimed.
He explains it in their terms.</p>
<p>After praising the Athenians for their piety and gods (&#8220;objects of your worship&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A23" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">23</a>), he draws attention to an altar 
to &#8220;&#8216;an unknown god&#8217;&#8221;. He tells them: I know <u>that</u> god; he is God; he &#8220;made the world ...&#8221; (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A24" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">24</a>) and is &#8220;Lord&#8221; of it. 
He depends on nothing (&#8220;as though ...&#8221;, v.

gods; he is the source of all (&#8220;gives ... life&#8221;). Not being confined to specific &#8220;shrines&#8221; (v.

&#8220;all nations&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26</a>) 
from <em>proto-human</em>, Adam (&#8220;one ancestor&#8221;): Stoics too believed in the unity of humanity. Deuteronomy 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Deuteronomy+32%3A8" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">32:8</a> says that God 
&#8220;fixed the boundaries of the peoples&#8221;; dividing history into eras is basic to faith (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A26" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">26b</a>). The Greeks thought of the 
seasons of nature&#8217;s cycles and the earth&#8217;s habitable zones. They <em>searched and groped for God</em> (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A27" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">27</a>); we go further: we find, obey 
and serve him.</p>
<p>Paul now quotes Greek writers in defence of his arguments (v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A28" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">28</a>). For &#8220;God's 
offspring&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A29" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">29</a>)
idols are inadequate objects of worship; only the true God, the creator
of heaven and earth and of all lower orders of spiritual being, is
worthy of our worship and service. Jesus has brought an era when
turning to God is imperative; &#8220;ignorance&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A30" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">30</a>) of his ways is no longer 
acceptable &#8211; because God will have Jesus (&#8220;a man&#8221;, v. 
<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=Acts+17%3A31" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">31</a>)
judge people&#8217;s worthiness. This we know because he has raised Jesus.
Raising &#8220;a man&#8221; to divine status is hard for Paul&#8217;s hearers to accept.
Some are open to further discussion but others are not.</p>

<b>Psalms</b>
</small><p>
<small>Psalms is a collection of collections. The psalms were written over many
centuries, stretching from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to
after the Exile (about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise,
laments, thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the
book, there are five "books"; there is a doxology ("Blessed be ... Amen and
Amen") at the end of each book.

<b>1 Peter</b>
</small><p>
<small>An elder in Rome wrote this pastoral exhortation to those in charge of 
churches in Asia Minor. ("Babylon" is a common code-name for Rome; see 
Revelation 17:5-6.) The opening greeting claims that Peter is the author, 
but today most scholars agree that it was written in his name, to give it 
authority (a common practice at that time.) The addressees appear to be 
Gentiles, rural folk, both resident aliens and household slaves, in Asia 
Minor. Christians can expect to suffer, to be ostracized, to be "called 
names": they are in the midst of a pagan culture. Though they are "aliens" 
in this world, God has given them "a new birth ... into an inheritance that 
is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (1:3-4).

<strong>1 Peter 3:13-22</strong>

now he treats the topic explicitly. Who will weaken you in your faith

<em>when</em> is meant. Suffering for good conduct puts you in a happy

transcend all fears. Be prepared to defend your commitment to Christ,

is your example of suffering; he brings you to God. He really died (&#8220;in
the flesh&#8221;), but he overcame death. Even the condemnation carried out

proclaimed it (while dead) to the wayward dead (&#8220;spirits in prison ...

<small>John is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a chronological
account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels do, to a degree), but
rather "...these things are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus
is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life
in his name." John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process.

<strong>John 14:15-21</strong>
<p>Jesus continues to prepare his disciples for his departure. He has
given them a special commandment: to &#8220;love one another&#8221; just as he has
loved them (<a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+13%3A34" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">13:34</a>). Love requires obedience and

those who love him are those who obey. Keeping Jesus&#8217; commandments
makes possible the continuance of their relationship with him &#8211; but
how? The Father will send them &#8220;another&#8221; (v. <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?version=nrs&amp;word=John+14%3A16" onmouseover="window.status='Click here to read the text'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true">16</a>) representative of God, also in

of faith, of revealed doctrine. He is neither perceivable nor knowable
by sinful humans, so they have no access to him. But &#8220;you&#8221; both
