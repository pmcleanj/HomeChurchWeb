</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Questions:
<br> One might read all of these lectionary texts as being about the
presence of God. The psalm reading covers a lot of ground, from times
of testing and trial ("you let people ride over our heads") to times of
deliverance ("you have brought us out to a spacious place"). Yet the
psalmist sings of "what God has done for me," this God whose "steadfast
love" abides. The reading from First Peter also addresses suffering and
provides a firm assurance of God&#8217;s blessing, exhorting us to be ready
to defend and explain "the hope" that is in us. What is this hope,
persistent and planted deep within, if not God&#8217;s Spirit moving us
toward trust and "doing good"? The words of Jesus before his death,
comforting his disciples and making promises of his presence with them
no matter what: these words assure them &#8211; and us &#8211; that the Spirit of
God will be with us and carry us and empower us to great things, "far
more than all we can ask or imagine."
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">
The reading from Acts, however, is a different kind of testimony than
that of the psalmist, a different kind of exhortation than that of
First Peter, and a different kind of promise, too. It is put in a
different form, also, and a different setting: Paul is in Athens, the
center of Greek culture and thought, and he's addressing a very
different crowd than he usually does. He's in the Areopagus, not the
synagogue, and these folks don&#8217;t know &#8211; or care &#8211; about the history of
the patriarchs and God&#8217;s faithfulness to the Hebrew people &#8211; and they
probably wouldn't be too moved by the story, either. Paul can&#8217;t
rehearse the story of Moses or the Promised Land, or speak of the
prophets or the exile. No, instead, he meets these people "where they
are." </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
verses that precede this lectionary text help to set the stage, as Paul
has not been much of a tourist here in the cultural center of the known
world. Instead of appreciating art and architecture, he keeps stubbing
his religious toe on one idol after another, and he is annoyed (&#8220;deeply
distressed,&#8221; as a matter of fact). In the introductory verses (16-21),
he seems restless and argumentative, first in the synagogue and then in
the marketplace. Luke portrays him as relentlessly pursuing debate,
"every day with those who happened to be there." When he speaks of
Jesus and the Resurrection, the Greek word for the latter might have
been misunderstood as a goddess, Anastasia, and some people thought he
was talking about a new god and his consort. This would have been
illegal, and Paul might have gone the way of Socrates. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">But,
instead, the philosophers invited him to come and talk with them some
more about this "new teaching" &#8211; after all, the text says, lots of
people in Athens loved to spend their time &#8220;in nothing but telling or
hearing something new.&#8221; Paul accepts their invitation and delivers a
brilliant evangelism speech that begins by "getting on their good
side," complimenting them on their religious piety but offering them an
answer to what appears to be an unknown &#8211; "the unknown god" that
nevertheless inspires altars &#8211; the unknown that might stand for the
unanswered questions, the inexpressible longing for the transcendent,
the spiritual hunger that every human being experiences. Paul does them
a favor and names the focus of that hunger and longing, the answer to
their questions, and he makes it clear that this God cannot be housed
or shaped by humans &#8211; on the contrary, this God created and sustains us
all, believers and unbelievers alike. And another thing &#8211; this God has
let our ignorance go thus far, but now there will be no excuses, and we
must all repent and prepare for a day not of whimsical judgment (like
that of some Greek gods), but of righteousness and truth, embodied, he
claims in his last sentence, by the one God raised from the dead, Jesus
Christ. The speech was not a huge success, but the verses after the
lectionary text ends indicate that at least one distinguished member of
the community and an unknown woman were converted. </font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Here,
in the weeks after Easter, we continue to wrestle with the reality of
the Resurrection. How is Jesus Christ still alive in the midst of your
community of faith? How do you feel his presence, living and breathing,
in your church? How does his Spirit guide the life of your
congregation? In what ways is <i><b>God still speaking</b></i> through
the life of your congregation, still proclaiming new life and good
news? What difference does it make to your church, six weeks after
Easter, that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead? Can you, and the
members of your church, give an accounting of the hope that is within
you? How? What are the stories, the memories, and the present dreams
that account for this hope? Some people say that God&#8217;s presence is felt
only in intense, mystical experiences, and they spend a lot of effort
in "achieving" or at least in seeking such "highs." But others say that
the day-in, day-out faithfulness of loving and sharing and being open,
of going to church and of offering hospitality to others, seeking
justice and forgiveness, and offering the same, is just as important an
experience of God&#8217;s presence. Do you believe that <i><b>God still speaks</b></i> through this everyday kind of faithfulness? 
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Think,
then, about those who come to your church, especially visitors. The
Stoics and the Epicureans were the two main philosophies of the time,
represented in this text. And folks were spending lots of time, as
mentioned above, in telling or hearing something new. What are the main
philosophies of our time that swirl around us and distract us and
entice us? What are we intrigued by, on talk shows, in self-help books,
in discussion groups, and even in the pulpit &#8211; &#8220;new&#8221; ideas and methods
and philosophies that seem to compete with the gospel that we &#8211;
hopefully &#8211; preach and embody in our church life? Paul&#8217;s audience in
this text could be imagined as "the un-churched," those who do not
speak the language of our tradition, do not know the stories of our
people, do not value &#8211; yet &#8211; the heart of our faith. But they are open.
Yes, perhaps they are open to every new thing, and there are many
things that our culture offers, many answers, programs, and experts.
But the gospel endures when all the "something new" ideas fade.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">For
some people in our time, then, the gospel is something new. What are
the challenges to us in this text as we think about addressing those
who do not know "the story" or do not look to the same ancestors in
faith? Do we think of them as sustained by God, having "the times of
their existence and the boundaries of the places they would live"
determined by the same God we worship and depend on? Do we find that,
in the midst of materialism and nationalism and militarism, we depend
on "other gods" for our lives? How much do we feel that we "grope" for
God, who is near at hand, even though we think of ourselves as faithful
and religious? How do we hear the words "In him we live and move and
have our being" differently when we realize Paul is quoting a pagan
philosopher? In church or in the marketplace, then, how do we give an
accounting for the hope that is within us?<!-- END SERMON SEEDS -->

Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, &#8220;Athenians, I see how

city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among
them an altar with the inscription, &#8216;To an unknown god.&#8217; What therefore
you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the
world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does
not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human

we are God&#8217;s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like

of mortals. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now
he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day
on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom
he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising
him from the dead.&#8221;

the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither
sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and
he will be in you.
&#8220;I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while
the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live,
you also will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father,
and you in me, and I in you. They who have my commandments and keep
them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my
Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.&#8221;<!-- END GOSPEL -->

<br>May 1, 2005
<br>Acts 17:22-31

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">&#8220;JUST DOING WHAT CHURCHES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO&#8221;

</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">&#8220;What is it that makes your church so welcoming&#8211;so easy to be a part of?&#8221;
    The question came from a visitor to Peace United Church of Christ in Kewaskum, Wisconsin.
     Senior minister Eric Kirkegaard had heard it before, but he still doesn&#8217;t have a glib or pat answer.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Everybody
acknowledges the warmth and welcome that one feels at Peace UCC on
Sunday mornings. Members are justifiably proud of their reputation for
openness to newcomers. But Rev. Kirkegaard believes that there is more
to the welcome than a warm, fuzzy feeling.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">Take
the church&#8217;s intentional ministry with its elderly members. In 1997 the
congregation installed an elevator for members and visitors who
couldn&#8217;t mount the church steps. In worship there are large-print
bulletins and aids for the hearing-impaired. And two years ago the
congregation raised money to hire part-time staff for home visitations
with those unable to attend church. With renewed vigor, some of those
&#8220;shut-ins&#8221; are coming back to worship now.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">But
Eric Kirkegaard is even more impressed with the attitude behind these
measures. Perhaps, of all things, the church budget gives it a
name&#8211;benevolence. The congregation at Peace UCC is generous in its
giving to others. It does so through wider mission support of the
Wisconsin Conference and national ministries, and also of the special
UCC mission offerings. The members are also generous to their own.
Every young person in the congregation is eligible for a scholarship
grant to help support their post-secondary school education.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">At
Peace UCC benevolence also includes gifts of time and talent&#8211;and sweat.
Every year now for almost twenty years, adult members have built a home
for Habitat for Humanity. Church youth, too, make a summertime mission
trip that includes a commitment to a housing project. And now the
college students want their own work experience during the winter
break&#8211;in someplace warm, of course.
</font></font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">But
at Peace UCC there is even more to benevolence than this. What the
members embody, perhaps without even knowing it, is a simpler yet
somehow profounder meaning of the words &#8220;kindness and good will&#8221; that
show forth without self-consciousness. &#8220;We&#8217;re just a church, doing what
churches are supposed to do&#8211;trying to love God and love our neighbor,&#8221;
is the way Rev. Kirkegaard puts it.

</font></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<br>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<br>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<br>
Third Reading: Gospel</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a
Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and
liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister
to read all of the lessons.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">The
psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the
lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or
recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is
appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way.
The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with
refrains and music.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.</font></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana,arial,ms sans serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica" size="1"><font sans="" serif,charcoal,geneva,helvetica="" face="arial,verdana,ms" size="2">During
Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative
sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first
option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture;
the second is thematically related to the other readings.</font></font></p><p>
