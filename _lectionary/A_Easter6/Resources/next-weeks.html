  <span class="smaller"></span><table cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td class="no_border" width="67%">The
animated pastor waved over the confirmation students gathered before
him.&nbsp; Baptism, he said, is not just the water, but the water
together with the Word.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like this:&nbsp; See?&nbsp; He took
a Bible in his hand and pulled it through the water in the baptismal
font sitting in front of him. The water, he said, comes with the
word.&nbsp; Baptism is the word made wet; the promises of God coming at
you through the font.&nbsp; Baptism, he said, is the promise that the
Word of God makes you clean, the promise that you have gone through the
waters with Christ, died in them, and come out alive on the other side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Another pastor at another time spoke with children watching a Baptism
of an infant child. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make the sign of the cross on the
baby&#8217;s head&#8212;watch,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And listen to the words that are spoken
as I sketch the cross on the baby&#8217;s forehead.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Child of God: you have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, and marked with the Cross of Christ forever.<br>
      <br>
The pastor looked up to speak with the children gathered in front of
the font.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like this: See?&nbsp; The cross is on this baby&#8217;s
head, invisible, but there, and the baby can never, never erase
it.&nbsp; He can ignore it.&nbsp; He can act like it&#8217;s not there.&nbsp;
He can pretend it doesn&#8217;t have any meaning in his life.&nbsp; But there
it is, on his forehead.&nbsp; Christ has claimed him as his child, and
that is a promise this child--and you--can never, never erase.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The waters of Baptism are precious waters: waters, as 1 Peter rejoices,
that &#8220;now save.&#8221; (1 Peter 3:21).&nbsp; By and through them, we receive
the promise that Christ is for us, not against.&nbsp; And if Christ is
for us, what can we fear that might be against?&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we
not but love God, and because of God, our neighbor?&nbsp; How can we
not but bear witness to the hope that is within us?<br>

<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading<br>
      </h4>The people of
Athens were &#8220;in every way very religious&#8221; (Acts 17:22). They realized
that the objects of their worship were limited, that God surpassed all
that they might picture God to be.&nbsp; God was not just an object,
not just a mythical creature who appealed to the human gravitation
toward power, greed, jealously, lust.&nbsp; God was more than what they
might imagine God to be:&nbsp; they even had an altar inscribed to the
God &#8220;unknown,&#8221; the God of which some of their poets had spoken of as
being parent of all&#8212;the one, the poets had said, of whom &#8220;we are
indeed.&nbsp; . . offspring.&#8221; (Acts 17:28).<br>
      <br>
Paul uses the given religiosity of the people&#8212;and their
intelligence--to witness to the God whom they perceived, but did not
know.&nbsp; The &#8220;unknown God&#8221; of their altar, that God is the God &#8220;who
made the world and everything in it&#8221; (Acts 17:24) That God is not
appeased by the work of human hands; &#8220;as if he needed anything&#8221; (Acts
17:25).&nbsp; The unknown God is not swayed by human reaction or
gifts&#8212;it is he who has made humanity, given life, given &#8220;everything&#8221;
(Acts 17:25).&nbsp;&nbsp; The unknown God gives because God is God, not
because humanity can somehow persuade that giving. <br>
      <br>
The unknown God is thus powerful, but not thereby &#8220;far from each one of
us&#8221; (Acts 17:27). God is found in our own living, moving.&nbsp; God is
found in our being &#8220;offspring.&#8221;&nbsp; Further, Paul witnesses, if we
are God&#8217;s offspring, God is surely not made like &#8220;gold, or silver, or
stone, a representation by&nbsp; . . . art and imagination&#8221; (Acts
17:29).&nbsp; God is more; God is one who calls humanity to
repentance.&nbsp; And that, Paul cries, is evidenced not only by what
can be seen by and in and through creation, but through the man Jesus,
the one in and through whom the world will be judged, as witnessed by
and through his resurrection from the dead.<br>

<li>What do you think persuaded the Athenians to construct an altar to
&#8220;an unknown god&#8221; (Acts 17:23)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are such &#8220;altars&#8221;
constructed in society today?&nbsp;</li><li>How does Paul use what the
Athenians know and believe about God to move toward witness to
Christ?&nbsp; What does this imply about the way in which we might be
called to witness to him?</li>
        <li>How do we continue to make God out to be a representation
of &#8220;art and imagination?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does God, in Christ, break
any such representation we might make?</li>
        <li>How does the gift of Baptism witness to Christ?&nbsp; How can it be used in our common witness to Christ?<br>

</h4>Peter writes these words to Christians who are threatened with
persecution for their faith.&nbsp; He begins by setting the stage
straight:&nbsp; harm can be around the corner, but what power does it
truly have, when it comes as a result of being &#8220;zealous for doing
right?&#8221;&nbsp; Nothing can separate the Christian from the love of God
in Christ (Romans 8:39).&nbsp;&nbsp; Better to do what is right for the
love of Christ and face persecution, than to do the wrong thing--
shrink from giving &#8220;a defense to any one who calls you to account for
the hope that is in you&#8221; (1 Peter 3:15) --for fear of what might result
from that confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For in that hope, and that hope
alone, there is power&#8212;the power of salvation.<br>
      <br>
Those who face persecution can look to their Baptism for
strength.&nbsp; In a different time of turmoil, God saved eight persons
from the flood through the building of the ark.&nbsp; Baptism
&#8220;corresponds&#8221; to this (1 Peter 3:21).&nbsp; Whatever persecution lies
ahead, Baptism has provided, already, the power to persevere through
it. Baptism &#8220;saves&#8221; (1 Peter 3:21)&#8212;not by taking dirt off the body, but
&#8220;as an appeal to God for a clear conscience&#8221; (1 Peter 3:21).&nbsp;
Baptism is the promise that the righteous died for the unrighteous,
that the righteous One might &#8220;bring us to God&#8221; (1 Peter 3:18).&nbsp;
Having been brought to God through the waters of Baptism, and having
received, in and through those waters, the promise that Christ&#8217;s
resurrection is one&#8217;s very own, what reason is there to fear those who
threaten to destroy the body, and life?&nbsp; The Christian&#8217;s life is
hid with God in Christ&#8212;the Lord of life, the victor over death.<br>

</h4>Jesus is speaking here to his disciples, promising them the gift
of the Holy Spirit after his ascension into heaven.&nbsp; To love
Jesus, in his absence, is to keep his commandments&#8212;the command to see
that he is the &#8220;way, the truth, and the life;&#8221; (John 14:6); the command
to &#8220;let not your hearts be troubled&#8221; (John 14:7); the command to love
one another, even as Jesus has himself first loved.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This would be a lonely and difficult and impossible venture, were it
not for Jesus&#8217; promise that he would &#8220;pray to the Father,&#8221; who would
give &#8220;another Counselor to be with you forever, even the Spirit of
truth&#8221; (John 14:15). The world will not receive this Counselor, will
neither know him or see him, even as the world did not know or see
Jesus.&nbsp; But the faithful will know the Counselor, and in this
knowing, not be left &#8220;desolate&#8221; (John 14:18).&nbsp;&nbsp; The faithful
will know the presence of Jesus through the Spirit&#8212;and receive the
assurance, through the Spirit, that because Jesus lives, so shall we,
also.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Through the gift of the Spirit, all will be connected&#8212;the faithful will
know that Jesus is in the Father, and the faithful in Jesus, and Jesus
in the faithful.<br>
So connected, we will do as our Lord has bid:&nbsp; &#8220;love him&#8221; by
keeping his commandments.&nbsp; In the process we will find ourselves
beloved by the Father and the Son-- and find ourselves seeing,
beholding the son, who has, through the keeping of the Commandment to
love as he has loved, made himself &#8220;manifest&#8221; (John 14:21).<br>
