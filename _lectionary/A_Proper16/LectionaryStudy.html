12:1-8</A> (from S.A.M.U.E.L)</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
a culture that seems to encourage, or even to require, spending
exorbitant amounts of money and time on our physical comfort, health,
and appearance, we still seem to suffer from a severe lack of
appreciation for our bodies. As Paul builds on his theology in his
Letter to the Romans, he does a &quot;therefore&quot; that exhorts us
to consider our bodies as &quot;living sacrifices,&quot; living,
breathing, dynamic offerings to God (the word &quot;sacrifice&quot;
is rooted in words that mean &quot;to make sacred&quot;), not dead
offerings but offerings still capable of transformation, of dramatic,
life-altering change that brings into being God's vision for us,
God's intention for us, God's hope for us. But Paul means more than
our bodies; he refers to our entire being, all of us, being
transformed by the power of God. Today, in our culture, if we conform
to the world around us, we think we can expend a lot of effort (and
time and money) into &quot;making something&quot; of ourselves,
improving our looks, our minds, our habits&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;but
Paul exhorts us to remember who it is who is really at work in our
lives and by what power we are truly transformed. We can read all the
self-help books we want, watch Dr. Phil, join health clubs, and
search the Net for valuable tips on self-improvement, but it is the
same God who put the stars in the sky and called the planets into
being, the same God who shaped us in secret, in our mother's womb.
The words &quot;self esteem&quot; in our culture (the empire we live
in?) have taken on a distorted importance, even though many have
sincerely sought to overcome the effects of childhood neglect and
emotional deprivation. <FONT FACE="arial, verdana, ms sans serif, charcoal, geneva, helvetica">(One
comedian has reassured us that each one of us is &quot;special, just
like everyone else.&quot;) It's refreshing to read Eugene Peterson's
translation of this familiar passage and to hear its meaning leap to
life: &quot;The only accurate way to understand ourselves is by what
God is and by what [God] does for us, not by what we are and what we
do for [God]&quot; (The Message). We also live in an age of
individualism where the needs and the power for good that the
community holds have been diminished in favor of each person's value,
role, needs and wants.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Again,
Paul calls us to a profound appreciation for the beauty and workings
of a body whose parts function together, each with its own role and
importance. In the same way, we are all part of the Body of Christ,
each with our own gifts and abilities and our own important role in
the unfolding of the Realm of God. John Dominic Crossan has written
about Paul's contrast between the Roman Empire and the Realm of God,
the former staking its glory on peace through victory, the latter
holding out the dream of peace through justice. Instead of being
consumed with one's own interests and needs, as one pastor has said,
&quot;Put yourself out there for the sake of something else and
someone else, and lay your gifts on the altar of justice.&quot; It is
a different way of thinking of sacrifice than the ancient cultures
had, but Paul is urging his readers, then and today, not to conform
to the thoughts and ways around them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>How
is the Still-speaking God calling your church to new life, to a
renewed and transformed existence? Do most of the people in your
church hear the word &quot;sacrifice&quot; as &quot;giving something
up&quot; rather than an offering to God of something living and
joy-filled? Do they think of their lives as offerings, not just the
things they &quot;sacrifice,&quot; but every joy and accomplishment,
every ordinary act? Again, Peterson's translation: &quot;Take your
everyday, ordinary life - your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and
walking-around life - and place it before God as an offering.&quot;
How might this be a sacrifice, a &quot;making sacred&quot; of our
lives, very different from a painful &quot;giving up&quot; but much
more likely to lead us to a wholly different way of being, a
transformation of our lives? </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&ldquo;Pew-work&rdquo; is like Home-work, except that
it is done in the pews, instead of being done at home. Because it is
focussed on the readings (as the sermon, presumably, also is) it can
be done during the sermon to help the listener concentrate. Or, it
can be done while waiting for everyone else to finish their
communion. It isn't done during prayers, or hymns, or the readings,
because</P>
