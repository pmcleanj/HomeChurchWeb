      <h2>Believing and Living</h2>
      <p>Once while bicycling through the San Juan Islands, I met a fellow cyclist at the ferry dock in Friday Harbor.  Although I’m not good at guessing people’s ages, he appeared to be under 40. He was friendly and pleasant, and we chatted about our respective trips, swapped stories about our past adventures, and about our hopes for future cycling excursions. He seemed normal enough. But during the ferry ride to Anacortes, he told me that his guardian angel had informed him that he was going to live until he was 150. He said that the angel had informed him that he had an important lesson to learn, and it would take him that long until he learned it, but once he did, he would die, right then and there. And he shared all this with me without knowing that I’m a pastor.  
</p>
      <p>Although I thought his beliefs were wacky, what really struck me about our conversation was how his beliefs governed the way he lived. Because of his belief in his guardian angel’s word, he lived each day with a confidence that he was safe. Because he lived without fear, he was willing to take adventurous risks.  He was absolutely certain that no matter what, he would be fine, believing he was guaranteed to live until he was 150. He’d wrecked a motorcycle once, and had cracked a bicycle helmet in a car-induced fall the previous year, but those experiences did not lead him to change his habits. He believed he was invincible. He had an incredible faith. His faith was not just a matter of what he thought on an intellectual level. It pervaded his attitude about life, and it made a real difference in the way that he lived.<br />

          <br />
I listened with amazement, realizing that nothing short of his own death would convince him of the folly of his beliefs (and at that point, it would be a little late for him to make any changes to his behavior.) And although his beliefs were non-conventional at best, he was certainly living according to his spiritual convictions.  As I rode my bike away from the ferry dock, my mind was spinning faster than my feet. On the one hand, I thought about whether his odd beliefs would ultimately make him dangerous to either himself or others.  Was he pushing the envelope of either delusion or fanaticism? Perhaps. But on the other hand, I was intrigued with the thought of how the church would be changed if all of us who confess to be Christian shared such a depth of conviction that we lived out our faith with the same intensity and dedication with which this fellow lived his.

      <h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading</h4>
      <p> In this text, Jeremiah complains to God. He laments that he is being persecuted on account of his prophetic words. He protests that his persecution is unjust; and laments that his faithful devotion to God has ruined his social life and made him an outcast (15-17). He blames God for failing to protect him (18). In verses 19-21, God responds. God insists that Jeremiah return to his prophetic task, and that Jeremiah continue to stand fast, speaking the truth (even though it won’t make him popular!) instead of capitulating to the crowd by telling them what they want to hear (19). God offers encouragement to Jeremiah, promising to remain with him to strengthen, protect and deliver him (20-21). </P>

<h4 class="band">Link to the second lesson</h4>
<p>So, what does it mean to be a follower of Christ? Continuing in the thematic framework of the gospel, what does taking up our cross and following look like in the context of our daily life? That’s the question that Paul is getting at in this text from Romans.  In 12:1-2, Paul exhorts us to “present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God” and to be “transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the will of God.”   Paul now offers some down to earth advice for Christian living. Paul places a strong emphasis on love and compassion, and offers practical instruction about how to live as a follower. Paul gives us a model of how to live as loving and merciful people who echo the love of God in our lives. Our calling is to be loving, gracious, and hospitable, not only to those whom we love and agree with, but also to strangers and one's enemies. </p>
      
<h4 class="band">Link to the Gospel</h4>
<p>Simon Peter is the opposite of the cyclist I’d met on the ferry. Peter had come up with the right answer when Jesus had asked him who he was, correctly confessing Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God (see 16:15-16). Peter’s religious convictions are right on track, but he doesn't do so well when it comes to putting those beliefs into action.  Peter objects vehemently when Jesus begins spelling out that what it means to be the Messiah is to suffer and to die.  "No way," says Peter. "It can't be. That can never happen." Peter knows the right answers to the questions, but hesitates when it comes to putting that theory into practice. Jesus responds to all this with further discussion about what it means to be his follower.  To be a follower of Jesus is more than just having the right answers at the right time, as Peter quickly found out when Jesus rebukes him. To be a follower of Jesus is a matter of the way that one lives...and dies.   "If any want to become my followers," Jesus said, "let them deny themselves, take up their cross and follow me" (verse 24). To live as a follower of Jesus is to have the cross govern one’s life.  The Christian faith is more than just knowing about Jesus and believing in a certain collection of doctrines; it is a way of life that involves actually living according to what we say we believe. To be a follower of Jesus is to follow in his footsteps, living for others and not for ourselves. Jesus speaks of the paradoxical reversal of the gospel: that losing is gaining, and dying is living (25-26). </p>
<br>

<h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p class="box_sml">1. What is the difference between being a person of faith and being a religious fanatic? How do you know when someone has crossed that line? How do you respond?</p>
<p>2. Peter objects to Jesus’ prediction of his impending death because it didn’t fit with Peter’s ideas about who and what the Messiah should be. What do you think was Peter afraid of? In what ways are we like Peter? In what way might you find yourself hesitant or resistant to God’s call because it pulls you beyond your comfort zone or puts you at risk? In the midst of that hesitance or resistance, where do you hear God’s word of promise, encouragement and grace? </p>
<p>3. In the context of your life, what does it mean for you to “take up your cross and follow”? What does that mean for the life of your congregation?  In what ways might the second lesson (Romans 12:9-21) give you new insight about what it means to take up your cross and follow? </p>
<p>4. In what ways does your faith govern your life? In what areas is your faith disconnected from the way you make your decisions and live your life on a day to day basis? In what ways might you and your congregation be transformed if you were to live out your faith with the same depth of conviction displayed by the cyclist on the ferry? </p>
