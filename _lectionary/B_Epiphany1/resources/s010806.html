<P>Focus Scripture:
<BR>Mark 1:4-11

<P>Weekly Theme:
<BR>Beloved Child

<P>Focus Statement:
<BR>"He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."


<P>Comment and Questions:

<BR>This is the first Sunday after Epiphany.  The visit of the Magi to Jesus and his later baptism in the river Jordan mark the appearance ("epiphany": manifestation) of Christ to the Gentiles - that is, the world.  Baptism and mission are joined in their source in Jesus, in whom God's self-sharing love is the redemption of the world. (from the UCC's basic stewardship resource, "Inspiring Generosity," page 15).  You will want to remember this in the upcoming Sundays of Epiphany (through February).

<P>Jesus' baptism, unlike John's, was not just a washing away of sin.  It brought the power of the Holy Spirit and a special relationship with God - a relationship available to all regardless of sin or merit, age or status, "Jew" or "Gentile."  This is the meaning of Epiphany.

<P>God's love embraces all of us, "just as I am, without one plea," as the old gospel song puts it.  Baptism is the acknowledgment of this.  It accepts God's fundamental recognition and welcome as Jesus knew and experienced this for all of us.

<P>"Baptize" comes from the Greek word "baptein," meaning "to dip, steep, dye, color."  Just as an ounce of dye colors a gallon of water, so recognition of God's love for us colors, "dyes," our whole lives, imperfect though we remain.  Like being given a check for a huge sum of money, if we don't cash it, it's still good but useless - and we cut ourselves off from what in fact we've been given.

<P>Looking at the world through the eyes of baptism we see that everyone is a "beloved child."  Sin is real, but God's grace and acceptance are more real.  They color our whole life.  It is not because we have value that we are loved but because we are loved that we have value. 

<P>This is the truth of baptism that, recognizing as well God's embrace of others, inspires mission, sending us into the world so that others too might know the love of God - the love that, as the popular song has it, "lifts us up where we belong."

<P>Baptism is, or should be, the motivation of the church and church membership.  How well do the people in our pews understand "baptism"?  Have we enabled them to grasp their membership in a worldwide movement of God's Spirit?  And do we find our unity in baptism and the inclusive welcome of God's love, or in agreement on all the other issues facing the church?  Disagreement is not divisive when colored by the baptismal "dye" of God's love!

<P><B>Genesis 1:1-5</B>

<P>In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

The voice of God is full of majesty.

<P>Ascribe to God, O heavenly beings,
<BR>ascribe to God glory and strength.

<P>Ascribe to God the glory of God's

<BR>worship God in holy splendor.

<P>The voice of God is over the waters;

<P>The voice of God is over the waters;
<BR>the God of glory thunders, God,

<P>The voice of God is powerful;

<P>The voice of God breaks the cedars;
<BR>God breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

<P>God make Lebanon skip like a calf,
<BR>and Sirion like a young wild ox.

<P>The voice of God flashes forth
<BR>in flames of fire.

<P>The voice of God shakes the

<BR>God shakes the wilderness of 
<BR>Kadesh.

<P>The voice of God causes the oaks to
<BR>whirl, and strips the forest bare;
<BR>and in God's temple all say,
<BR>"Glory!"

<P>God sits enthroned over the flood;

<!-- BEGIN EPISTLE -->

<P><B>Acts 19:1-7</B>

<P>While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the interior regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples. He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?" They replied, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." Then he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They answered, "Into John's baptism." Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus." On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied - altogether there were about twelve of them.

<P><B>Mark 1:4-11</B>

<P>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, "The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

<P>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, "You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased."

<P>The Baptism of Christ
<BR>January 8, 2006
<BR>Mark 1:4-11


<B><P>ONE PENNY A POUND</B>
<P>When the Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers organized a boycott of Taco Bell, it looked like a David vs.Goliath conflict in which the fast-food giant would win.  And not because the stakes threatened the company's bottom line, either. The farm workers only asked for one cent more per pound of tomatoes they picked - their first increase since 1980. But what hope did some Florida farm workers have of even getting the attention of corporate executives in California?
<P>If the farm workers' voices were not heard in the executive suites of Taco Bell, the justice of their cause was acknowledged and embraced by the United Church of Christ's 23rd General Synod, when the Florida Conference brought it to their attention. Meeting in Kansas City, Missouri, only three months after the boycott began, the delegates endorsed it. Before long, the campaign in behalf of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers became interdenominational. The Presbyterian Church (USA), Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), United Methodist Church, and the National Council of Churches of Christ all added their support.
<P>Even more important, the boycott gained grass-roots support. Irvine UCC in California, First Congregational in Downers Grove, Illinois, First Congregational in Memphis, Tennessee, Pilgrim Congregational in Cleveland, Ohio, First Congregational in Colorado Springs, Colorado, St. Andrew's in Louisville, Kentucky, First Congregational in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and First Congregational in Long Beach, California are only a few of the UCC congregations that participated in the campaign. For some members, that involved more than forgoing a Burrito Supreme. They demonstrated outside Taco Bell outlets and wrote letters to company executives.  
<P>Campus boycotts, stockholder resolutions, and a cross-country bus tour of Immokalee workers also helped get the company's attention. Finally, last March, Taco Bell agreed to the farm workers' demands, including endeavoring to raise farm labor standards in the future.
<P>In the midst of their campaign for economic justice, three members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers were honored with the prestigious Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award.  It was a touching moment for members of the United Church of Christ, who had stood with the late Senator in support of the California farm workers many years before, and now kept the faith in his absence.

<B>Liturgical notes on the Readings</A></B>

<!-- BEGIN LITURGICAL NOTES -->

<P>In ecumenical liturgical practice, there are normally three readings and one psalm at each Sunday service, in this order:<P>

First Reading: Hebrew Scripture<BR>
Response: Psalm (or Canticle) from the Bible<BR>
Second Reading: Epistle (or Acts or Revelation)<BR>
Third Reading: Gospel<P>

The first two lessons are normally read by laypeople, the Gospel by a Minister of the Word or a layperson. In Roman Catholic, Anglican and liturgical Protestant churches, it is uncommon for an ordained minister to read all of the lessons.<P>

The psalm is not a reading but a congregational response following the lesson from Hebrew Scripture: it is normally sung with a refrain or recited by the congregation as poetry. Occasionally, a canticle is appointed in place of a psalm; it is sung or recited in the same way. The New Century Hymnal provides a complete liturgical psalter with refrains and music.<P>

A hymn may be sung as an introduction to the proclamation of the Gospel.<P>

During Ordinary Time (seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost) two alternative sets of OT readings with responsorial psalms are provided. The first option is a semi-continuous reading through a book of Hebrew Scripture; the second is thematically related to the other readings.<P>
