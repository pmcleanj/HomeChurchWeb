<h2>Mighty Waters, Mighter Words </h2>
<p>I moved to the Midwest two and a half years ago after I graduated
from Pacific Lutheran University to attend seminary.&nbsp; When I tell
people that I actually miss the rain, they look at me like I am
crazy.&nbsp; But I cannot help it.&nbsp; The rain to me is a powerful
symbol of life and renewal and I sometimes feel lost without it. Now,
of course we do get our share of occasional thunderstorms and
downpours.&nbsp; But I am not talking about those torrential
floods.&nbsp; What I miss is that constant steady stream that
drip-drops, pitter-patters on the windshield as you are driving; that
runs down your umbrella in little rivulets and collects in various
boot-stomping puddles; that soaks and seeps deep into the muddy earth
quenching the thirst of all that is green and growing.&nbsp; If anyone
should understand what baptism is all about, it should be the people of
the rain.&nbsp; For the people of the rain are daily reminded of the
waters that washed over them in their baptism to bring about cleansing
and forgiveness of sins, and new life in Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But baptism is not all about the water.&nbsp; For baptism is a
sacrament, and a sacrament is a sign of God&#8217;s grace through an earthly
element combined with God&#8217;s Word.&nbsp; There is nothing mysterious or
magical about the properties of water alone.&nbsp; Broken down into its
most basic form, it is simply two hydrogen atoms combined with one
oxygen atom.&nbsp; It is God&#8217;s Word that gives this simple substance
the power to bring about new life and to make God&#8217;s love known to the
Children of God.&nbsp; It is God&#8217;s mighty Word that makes the Holy
Spirit&#8217;s presence known to us in baptism.</p>
<h4 class="band">Link to the First Reading </h4>
      <p>When does
life begin?&nbsp; Traditionally our interpretation of the first
creation account in Genesis has lead us to understand that God created
the world out of nothing &#8211; <em>ex   nihilo</em>.&nbsp; But more recent
scholarship has challenged this traditional notion, noting from 1:2
that God is not working from a total blank slate, but begins with a few
raw materials:&nbsp; &#8220;The earth was a formless void and darkness
covered the face of the deep.&#8221;&nbsp; It was common in the Ancient World
to believe that the earth originated from a deep watery abyss.&nbsp;
Water represented the uncontrollable chaos of the world, full of stormy
waves and dangerous sea-monsters.&nbsp; God&#8217;s act of creation was to
step in and begin to form order out of chaos.&nbsp; But whether or not
God started from nothing or had something already there to work with,
does not change the fact that Genesis marks this moment as God&#8217;s first
act of creation, this moment as &#8220;The Beginning.&#8221;&nbsp; Life begins at
this moment.&nbsp; Time begins at this moment.&nbsp; Moreover, it
begins through a Word from God.&nbsp; God simply says, &#8220;Let there be
light,&#8221; and there was light.&nbsp; God brings order out of chaos
through the simplicity of God&#8217;s spoken Word.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</p>

      <p>When does life begin for Christians?&nbsp; From the
moment we are conceived we come equipped with all of the raw materials
for human life &#8211; flesh, blood, breath, brains.&nbsp; But in light of
Genesis, is this the moment we should point to as our
&#8220;beginning&#8221;?&nbsp; Through baptism into the Holy Spirit, the water and
the word combine to bring order and meaning where there once was only
chaos and hopelessness.&nbsp; Through baptism into the Holy Spirit we
are reborn as Children of God and each day as we remember our baptism
our life begins anew again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <h4 class="band">Link to the Second Reading</h4>
      <p>The
disciples in Ephesus may have been disciples of John the Baptist.&nbsp;
They have received John&#8217;s baptism but this is not enough.&nbsp; Paul
explains that they must be baptized into the Holy Spirit, which they
have never heard of until now.&nbsp; John&#8217;s baptism of repentance was
an important step, but, according to Paul, its real significance was to
point to the one who was to come after him.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Immediately
upon hearing this, the disciples choose to be baptized in the name of
the Lord and they receive the Holy Spirit through the laying on of
hands.&nbsp; The power of the Holy Spirit enables them to speak mighty
words through the Spirit&#8217;s gifts of tongues and prophecy.&nbsp; Through
their baptism into the Holy Spirit, the power of God&#8217;s spoken Word
works in them and through them continuing to communicate God&#8217;s grace to
the community.</p>
      <h4>The Gospel Reading</h4>
  <p>John the
Baptist must have been quite a figure.&nbsp; He had achieved a certain
amount of fame and people came from everywhere to see him.&nbsp; They
trekked all the way out into the wilderness to get a glimpse of this
strange man who wore camel&#8217;s hair and ate locusts and wild honey.&nbsp;
They made pilgrimages to hear this man speak and to be invocated into
his baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp; But the
words that they heard him speak were not what they might have
expected.&nbsp; For his words did not point to himself but to someone
else.&nbsp; Despite John the Baptist&#8217;s growing fame and rumored
reputation, there was one about to come after him who would be even
mightier.&nbsp; &#8220;For I have baptized you with water; but he will
baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The introduction of
Jesus into the gospel of Mark begins here.&nbsp; There is no record or
account of his life previous to this moment.&nbsp; Whatever happened in
his prior life is irrelevant to the story.&nbsp; Mark&#8217;s account of
Jesus begins with his baptism and it is quite an introduction.&nbsp;
Upon Jesus&#8217; baptism, the heavens open up and the Spirit descends in the
form of a dove.&nbsp; We tend to read this as being a primarily
graceful, serene moment.&nbsp; However, it must have been anything but
that.&nbsp; For the word in Greek used to describe the heavens opening
up (<em>schizomenous</em>) is where we get our word &#8220;schism&#8221;
from.&nbsp; It literally means to tear apart or to rip open violently
and is actually a rather terrifying image.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p>So,
too, is it with the dove.&nbsp; The dove is a symbol of peace and yet
few people realize that it is one of the more ferocious birds that
exist in the feathered kingdom.&nbsp; But the dove is not a symbol of
peace because of its gracefulness or docility as people tend to think.
In the Ancient World, doves were used as carriers to deliver messages
to far away peoples, much like pigeons have been used in the more
recent past.&nbsp; Thus, doves became a symbol of peace because they
provided a means for communication, and peace comes through words and
communion with others.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Through baptism into the Holy
Spirit, we receive God&#8217;s mighty Word into our own lives as God
communicates God&#8217;s love to us.&nbsp; Through baptism, we receive the
peace to communicate that Word to others and to live out that Word in
the world.</p>
  <h4 class="box_sml">Questions for Discussion</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do you remember anything about your baptism?&nbsp; If so,
what do you remember?&nbsp; If not, find someone who was present and
ask him or her to tell you about it.&nbsp; Does knowing the story of
your baptism help you to know more about your identity as a child of
God?</p>
<p>2. For myself, walking in the rain serves as a reminder of my
baptism.&nbsp; For others, making the sign of the cross on their
forehead in the shower is their daily reminder.&nbsp; What other ways
can you think of to remember your baptism?&nbsp; How might
incorporating such a simple daily ritual of baptismal remembrance into
your routine affect other areas of your life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;What areas in your life do you feel that chaos has taken
over?&nbsp; What are the sea-monsters that you face?&nbsp; How might
God&#8217;s Word of grace help you find order and meaning again?</p>
<p>4. In their baptism into the Holy Spirit, the disciples at Ephesus
were gifted with the ability to speak in tongues and to prophecy.&nbsp;
What gifts and abilities has the Spirit given to you?&nbsp; How can you
use these gifts to communicate God&#8217;s grace to others?</p>
