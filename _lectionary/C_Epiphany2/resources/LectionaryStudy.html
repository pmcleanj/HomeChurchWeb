text in Isaiah is part of a larger oracle whereby Isaiah is
announcing the vindication of Israel. As you might note, our
particular text picks up on the image of a wedding celebration. In
the Old Testament the image of the people of Israel betrothed and
married to God is used in several places. <BR><BR>The theme of
&ldquo;newness&rdquo; is front and center in this text as well.
Whenever you see a name change in Scripture, it signifies or
symbolizes a new relationship, a new status (Abram and Sari becomes
Abraham and Sarah, Jacob becomes Israel, and Saul becomes Paul). The
titles in our text (verses 3 and 4) seem odd because they are phrases
that are capitalized to signify that they are proper names and God
changes the names.<BR><BR>By the action of God, the people of Israel
are brought back from exile and restored to a new and exalted
relationship to God. Like a bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so
God now rejoices over Israel. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">This
book can be divided into two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1
to 39 were written before the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700
BC. These were difficult times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a
disastrous war was fought with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel,
the northern kingdom, in 723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the
cause of these events as social injustice, which he condemned, and
against which he fought valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written
during and after the Exile in Babylon. They are filled with a message
of trust and confident hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some
scholars consider that Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the
book, written after the return to the Promised Land. These chapters
speak of hope and despair; they berate the people for their sin, for
worshipping other gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks
of the hope that God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory
and make a new home for all peoples. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Persia
has conquered Babylon and has permitted the people of Israel to
return to a small parcel of land round Jerusalem. The land is
ravished, and after initial elation, the people feel that God has
ceased to care for them. The prophet has told of a new Zion &ndash;
of a renewed city and people. The new Jerusalem will be built by
foreigners (61:5); people will be more faithful to God; he will
establish a pact with them that will last forever.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Now either the
prophet or God tells of the cleansing of Israel&rsquo;s reputation
(&ldquo;vindication&rdquo;, 62:1): it will break forth with the
suddenness of dawn in the desert &ndash; there one moment it is dark,
and the next light. So too will her &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; be seen &ndash;
to the extent that &ldquo;all the kings&rdquo; (v. 2, all nations)
will see God&rsquo;s glory, his power, reflected in, and radiated by,
Israel. When God made a pact with Abram, giving him new status as
&ldquo;ancestor of a multitude of nations&rdquo; (Genesis 17:5), he
changed his name. So too will God&rsquo;s people enjoy a new status:
they will be a &ldquo;royal&rdquo; (v. 3) people protected by God. V.
4 tells us Israel&rsquo;s new status: she will become God&rsquo;s
spouse. The image of Israel&rsquo;s salvation as &ldquo;a burning
torch&rdquo; (v. 1) is reminiscent of the many torches illuminating
the city on the Feast of Tabernacles, a festival like our Harvest
Thanksgiving. God promises that no longer will he give Israel&rsquo;s
harvests to her enemies (v. 8), as punishment for disobedience. God
will be seen to love Israel again: a truly joyous event.</FONT></FONT></P>

Isaiah, this passage was written in the time of &quot;post
celebration blues.&quot; After fifty years in exile, Jewish
leadership had returned from Babylon to rebuild Jerusalem. After
several years of rejoicing the reality of hard work set in; the
people's resolve began to slacken and dejection reared it ugly head.
The people were home, but did not care about the task at hand.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In the midst of
the city's depression, God declared his intent; he would speak until
the city's glory (reputation) returns. [1] The city was being rebuilt
because God wanted it, not through the mere efforts of the people. As
the spokesperson of the divine, the prophet, too, would not be
silent; he would praise, shame, and pester the people until the city
was rebuilt to its glory. In this way, God really spoke through the
prophet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Once the city was
rebuilt, non-Jews (i.e., the &quot;nations&quot; and kings) would
witness its glory. God would pronounce the rebuilding by giving the
city a new name and a crown, both reflecting the marriage of a young
maiden to a king. [2-3] The virgin maiden has only the promise of
adding to the kingdom with royal heirs; in this sense, she was
&quot;barren&quot; or &quot;desolate.&quot; In the same way, a city
partially rebuilt was not truly whole; to some, it was barren and
desolate, like some of our inner city neighborhoods. But only the
cynic could not see potential; through God's eyes, even the barren
and desolate had in them the seeds of joy and intimate relationship.
Once the maiden married the king, she took a new name and a crown as
queen. The city, too, would have a new reputation (name and crown)
because of its close relationship with God. And like the joy at a
marriage feast, the glory of the city would be a joy to God and its
inhabitants [3-4].</FONT></FONT></P>

&ldquo;graced-filled gifts&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;charismaton,&rdquo;
the Greek word that gives us &ldquo;charismatic.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>12:6-7 The word
&ldquo;follower&rdquo; was added in parentheses, because, in context,
Paul was speaking to the community at Corinth. His comments were
aimed at Christians.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>How do people
know we are &ldquo;Church?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This is not a
question of individual effort (How do people know we are
Christians?), but one of community. Two millennia ago, a Jewish
apostle wrote to a Christian community in a Greek culture to answer
the question. In doing so, Paul tried to &ldquo;re-evangelized&rdquo;
the believers at the Greek seaport of Corinth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A few
observations need to be made before we look at the text. First, as
the previous paragraph indicated, a person from one culture wrote to
people in another culture. So, there might be cultural accommodation
(to the Corinthians) amidst cultural assumption (by Paul). Second,
Paul wrote in an atmosphere of expectation; he and his audience
assumed the end times were immanent, if not present. Both of these
observations impact how Paul would define &ldquo;Church.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The discussion of
the spiritual gifts took place in the context of scandal among the
Corinthian faithful. This was a &ldquo;charismatic&rdquo; community,
defined by the exercise of various gifts: speaking in tongues,
healing, prophecy, etc. The Corinthians took pride in their gifts to
the point of braggadocio and one-upmanship. The leadership of the
community must have felt threatened, for the Corinthians were
splintering into groups with their own rivaling leaders.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Paul argued
against notion of their narrow notion of &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo;
leadership. Instead, he argued for the big picture. He began with the
leadership of the Spirit. For Paul, God was in charge. And Paul saw
the leadership of the Spirit in the context of God&rsquo;s plan. This
was Paul&rsquo;s cultural presumption. The Jewish notion of creation
(and prayer) could be simply stated that all things came from God, so
they would return to God. Therefore, in the end times, all things
would return to God. In his Christian view, all things would return
through Christ.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Paul&rsquo;s
emphasis on Trinity began with the situation at present (the gifts of
the Spirit) and then proceeded to the end times (return of Christ,
then to God). But he also used the Trinity to explain the notion of
Church. The Church had various types of spiritual gifts, but there
was only one Spirit. It had various types of ministries, but there
was only one Lord Jesus upon whom the ministries were modeled and
rooted. And these gifts and ministries worked together in the way God
the Father willed them to work together. Beneath his argument that
the Trinity defined the Church was the notion that Church should be
based on harmony, just as the Father, Son, and Spirit worked
harmoniously.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>There were
various gifts given to various people, that was true. But what were
those gifts? And why were they given? Paul answered the last question
first. The Spirit gave its &ldquo;charisms&rdquo; for the good of the
community, not for the glory of its members. So, to envision these
various gifts as the means to achieve the common good, there had to
be a &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo; of gifts. Here, Paul tried to make a
cultural accommodation to the Greek community. The highest virtue in
the Greek world was wisdom, the ability to make clear and correct
judgments. Such a virtue was higher than knowledge, for it guided the
person to seek the right knowledge. Both wisdom and knowledge led to
firm faith. The rest of the gifts were based upon spiritual power and
the needs within the community.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>There were some
parallels between the gifts and the hierarchy of leadership Paul
listed later in 12:28. But, in the context of the letter, Paul
emphasized the unity of the Church with the image of &ldquo;the Body
of Christ.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>How do people
know we are &ldquo;Church?&rdquo; We communicate the sense of the
Church when we work in harmony with others and use our Spirit-given
gifts to serve others. Church is not a place for egos. It is a place
for charity.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>During
this church year season of Epiphany, our texts &ldquo;reveal&rdquo;
to us the identity, nature, and characteristics of Jesus the Savior.
The gospel writer John begins this task of making Christ known to us
with the miracle at the wedding in Cana (Miracle is the word I use,
John uses the word sign). The story follows the basic pattern of a
miracle story; setting, preparation for the miracle, the miracle
itself and the conclusion. This miracle story centers on Jesus
changing water into wine at the wedding in Cana.<BR><BR>If I had to
put one word on this miracle account I would use the word &ldquo;newness&rdquo;
to describe all that is going on. Let me explain. First, Jesus has
just invited two unnamed people, Andrew, Simon and Phillip to &ldquo;follow
me.&rdquo; John does not bother listing the disciples as &ldquo;disciples&rdquo;
so even though Nathaniel is not listed elsewhere for John he would
still be considered a disciple of Jesus. Notice that some of these
folks were disciples of John the Baptist (see John 1:35-51). With
Jesus there is a new rabbi and a new relationship is formed. It is
three days after this first gathering of disciples that Jesus comes
to the wedding at Cana. (John 2:1)<BR><BR>The wedding itself is a
celebration of newness. We have to remember that marriages in the
first century were not like ours today. They were arranged marriages.
What that means is that not only do we have the coming together of
the bride and groom in a new relationship, but the coming together of
two extended families in a new relationship. This newness was an
occasion for joy and celebration. The wedding feast called for the
best of everything.<BR><BR>All of this sets the stage for the miracle
of Jesus. Alas even the best preparation fails sometimes. It seems
this wedding celebration was such a success that the couple ran out
of wine. Mary (who is never named in the Gospel of John but always
referred to as &ldquo;the mother&rdquo; of Jesus) suggests that her
son take care of the problem. <BR><BR>I love this interchange between
Mary and Jesus because it seems so real to me of the exchanges
between parents and adult children. Mary doesn&rsquo;t ask Jesus to
fix the problem, like Marie, the mother on Everyone Loves Raymond,
she &ldquo;hints&rdquo; that Jesus might fix the problem. At first
Jesus gives a typical real answer, &ldquo;hey, it&rsquo;s their
problem not mine or yours for that matter.&rdquo; But then Jesus must
have known what Mary was thinking so he adds the phrase, &ldquo;my
hour has not yet come.&rdquo;<BR><BR>For the evangelist John, the
&ldquo;hour&rdquo; is always a reference to the passion, death,
resurrection and ascension of Jesus. For John, this is when Jesus
comes into his glory, this is when Jesus is revealed to all as the
promised Messiah, this is when Jesus comes into his power. <BR><BR>But
notice, Mary is not impressed, his mother said to the servants, &ldquo;Do
whatever he tells you.&rdquo; And she simply walks away confident
that Jesus will come through and provide.<BR><BR>Next, John, who kind
of cruises through this story at neck-break speed, slows down to give
us very minute details about the stone jars. &ldquo;Now standing
there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification,
each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them [the
servants], &ldquo;Fill the jars with water.&rdquo; And they filled
them up to the brim.&rdquo; <BR><BR>Immediately one has to ask the
question why is John giving us so much detail. The answer can only be
that John wants us to know that this is an extravagant miracle. Jesus
didn&rsquo;t turn a couple of pitchers of water into a cheap
chardonnay. He turned, on the low end, 120 gallons of water into the
finest wine the Galilean Wine Spectator had every tasted (as noted by
the wine steward in verse 10). This wasn&rsquo;t Thunderbird, this
was Chateau Rothschild. This was extravagant, beyond what was
necessary, beyond expectations.<BR><BR>Now there may be some among
our readers who are wondering, why wine? Why couldn&rsquo;t Jesus
have changed the water into Pepsi or Coke? Don&rsquo;t we have enough
problems with alcohol in our day that we do not really need the
Savior of the World promoting consumption by providing 120 gallons of
wine at a wedding reception where people tend of over indulge as it
is?<BR><BR>I believe the answer lies in the Old Testament. In the Old
Testament good wine is a symbol and a sign of God&rsquo;s new age
breaking into the world. See Isaiah 25:6, Amos 9:13 and Joel 3:18. As
the author of the New Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible states, &ldquo;John
2:1-11 can be read as more than the first act in Jesus&rsquo;
ministry. It also stands as the fulfillment of the OT eschatological
hopes, as the inaugural act of God&rsquo;s promised
salvation.&rdquo;<BR><BR>There lies the &ldquo;epiphany&rdquo; in
this week&rsquo;s text. Jesus is the messiah who brings about, when
his hour comes, God&rsquo;s promised salvation. Jesus is extravagant
in his giving (even to giving his life). We are the recipients of
this &ldquo;grace upon grace&rdquo; to steal John&rsquo;s own words
(John 1:16). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

is the fourth gospel. Its author makes no attempt to give a
chronological account of the life of Jesus (which the other gospels
do, to a degree), but rather &quot;...these things are written so
that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of
God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&quot;
John includes what he calls signs, stories of miracles, to help in
this process. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">John uses
symbolism extensively in his telling of the good news. He says in
20:31: &ldquo;these [signs] are written so that you may come to
believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through
believing you may have life in his name&rdquo;. Our reading looks
forward to Jesus&rsquo; resurrection and glorification (&ldquo;on the
third day&rdquo;, v. 1), the Last Supper, and the messianic banquet
expected at the end of time, when Christ comes again. The &ldquo;mother
of Jesus&rdquo; appears for the first time in the gospel; the last
time is when she stands at the foot of the cross. On both occasions,
Jesus addresses her as &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; (v. 4), a title roughly
equivalent to </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Madam</FONT></FONT></EM>
<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">today: Jesus is
guided in his ministry only by the Father&rsquo;s will (&ldquo;my
hour ...&rdquo;). Mary&rsquo;s words in v. 5 suggest that she
believes in Jesus, as she does at the foot of the cross. Jesus has
the water jars filled completely (&ldquo;to the brim&rdquo;, v. 7)
with water. In Judaism, the &ldquo;rites of purification&rdquo; (v.
6, washing before and after eating) were ceremonial, but in totally
transforming water into wine, Jesus replaces the old (Judaism) with
the new; wine is a symbol originating in Christ. In Isaiah, marriage
between God and his people symbolizes the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s
purpose for his people; here the abundance of good wine symbolizes
the joy accompanying the fulfilment (as foretold in several prophetic
books). John presents &ldquo;signs&rdquo; (v. 11) as aids to people
in reaching his objectives (20:31). Jesus shows that God is present
in his very nature (&ldquo;his glory&rdquo;).</FONT></FONT></P>

sign.</FONT></FONT></P>

While Jesus is the subject of this sentence (with its singular verb),
the literal phrase &quot;and his disciples&quot; indicated Jesus'
followers were also invited. The context of the wedding celebration
argued from a small number of followers.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>2:4 &quot;What
(is this problem between) me and you, Woman?&quot; This statement has
two Semitic phrases. &quot;What to me and to you?&quot; is a rebuke.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Woman,&quot;
however, was not a rebuke or a sign of disrespect. In a culture that
segregated the genders, the fact that his mother would address Jesus
in public showed initiative. Jesus responded with deference. Indeed,
the Semitic title &quot;Woman&quot; showed respect.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The combination
of rebuke and respect was like the tension between the hidden glory
(pre-ministry) and revealed glory (ministry) of Jesus. This tension
was a theme of John when he wrote of Jesus' &quot;hour.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>2:6 &quot;two or

were two issues stated in this sentence. First, when did the miracle
happen? When Jesus instructed the stewards to pour the water into the
jars? Or, when Jesus instructed the stewards to draw the liquid from
the jars and take it to the steward? John does not indicate the time
frame. His point is not the time of the miracle, but its realization.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The second issue
lies in the chief steward. Some scholars insist the chief steward was
a slave chosen to serve the tables. More likely, however, the chief
steward was either a close friend of the family or the family's
patron, who acted as a &quot;master of ceremonies.&quot; Such a
position carried great honor. See the commentary for more
information.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>2:10 &quot;best
wine&quot; is literally &quot;good wine&quot; The comparative &quot;good&quot;
in this context actually meant the superlative &quot;best.&quot; The
comparison between the good and a lesser is not a mere matter of
quality. The &quot;good&quot; wine was a festival quality, reserved
for celebrations like a wedding. The &quot;lesser&quot; was everyday
drinking wine. The water-turned-wine drawn from the stone jars tasted
like an expensive vintage.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>2:11 &quot;first
of signs&quot; The word &quot;first&quot; meant more than the
beginning of a sequence. This sign was the paradigm that threw light
on all other Jesus performed. This sign revealed the person of Jesus
and his mission.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;he revealed
his glory&quot; The term &quot;glory&quot; referred to the reputation
of the person (Jesus was a man of mighty signs). And it referred to
the inner character (in this case, the divinity of Jesus). Here,
image and substance met.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In a small
community at the time of Jesus, weddings were regional affairs. They
celebrated not only a wedding, but the union of two clans. The focus
was not only on the bride and groom, but on the patriarchs of the
clans.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Within the
wedding, the job of the &quot;master of ceremonies&quot; (i.e., the
&quot;head waiter&quot; in this story) was a position of honor and
power. The MC controlled the invitation list, the order and flow of
the ceremony, and seating arrangements. Since, the MC might be the
family's representative (i.e., accountant, lawyer, and economic
negotiator all rolled into one), the position might be paid.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Invited to the
party, Jesus and his mother should have been minor characters, but
they move to center stage because of a problem: a wine shortage. This
was a critical situation, because the honor of the bride and groom,
the patriarchs of the two clans joined by the union, and the
headwaiter were at stake. The mother of Jesus stepped in to save the
day. [1-3]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus objected to
his mother's request; the &quot;hour&quot; (referring to the time of
his death) was to be the time of revelation and faith, but his mother
wanted a miracle now! So, Jesus gave in. [4-6]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The six stone
jars were connected to Jewish ritual washings. Such washings made the
person clean, &quot;kosher.&quot; Many scholars have put an emphasis
upon the number of jars, &quot;six,&quot; which represented an
unfulfilled state in the time of Jesus. The number &quot;six&quot;
conveyed a message. Judaism lacked its Messiah and the Kingdom he
represented. Jesus used the jars (representing the tradition of
Judaism) to reveal a taste of God's kingdom. In this sense, Jesus
completed and transformed the traditions of Judaism. His action
completed what was missing.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The water turned
wine has many meanings. God's kingdom was to be a feast with endless
wine and merriment. Water has a baptism motif, while wine is
Eucharistic. Both foreshadow the water and blood (wine) that flow
from Jesus' side at his death. Even nature of the new wine (the new
revelation of Jesus) is superior to that of the old wine that ran out
(the old revelation of Law and the prophets). All these meanings have
one source: Jesus. [7-10]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Now we can see
the importance of verse 11. The sign in Cana was the first revelation
of Jesus in John's gospel and the first opportunity for faith from
his followers. The sign revealed the Kingdom and its Messiah.</FONT></FONT></P>

Worship and Sacrament (CCC 1110-1112)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In John's gospel,
Jesus revealed his glory through &quot;signs:&quot; objects and
action that point to something greater than themselves. Jesus gave
the Church seven particular &quot;signs &quot; through which he
reveals his glory to the worship community. We call these &quot;signs&quot;
sacraments.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A sacrament is a
physical sign (object and/or action) through which God reveals
Himself to us. The Catholic Church has sacraments to express a
mystery, something that we cannot fully understand. In the case of
the Eucharist, for example, eating and drinking expresses the fact
that we are united with God; the act of eating and drinking does not
totally explain how this unity came about. We are certain that God is
present in the sacrament (for example, we truly receive the Body and
Blood of Christ) through faith. (1111)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As Christians, we
worship God the Father for creating and saving us. God the Father
sent us his Son as a sign of his love. God the Father sent us his
Spirit to give us faith and the privilege to be called &quot;children
of God.&quot; (1110) The Holy Spirit calls the Church members
together for worship, makes Christ present in the sacraments of the
Church, and helps the members of the Church grow together in love.
(1112)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Besides the
sacraments, what signs do God use to reveal himself in your life? How
does he use them? How do these signs help your prayer life to grow?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jesus gave his
followers a sign that revealed who he was and the nature of his
mission. Something as simple as a sip of wine opens the mind, the
heart, and the spirit to He Who is Greater. And causes the one
drinking to fall down in worship. This is root of &quot;sacrament.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
