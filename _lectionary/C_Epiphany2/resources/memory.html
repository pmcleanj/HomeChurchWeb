Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there
went out a fame of him through all the region round about.<BR><SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.<BR><SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom
was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for
to read.<BR><SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was delivered
unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the
book, he found the place where it was written,<BR><SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach
the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,<BR><SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<BR><SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat
down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him.<BR><SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he began to
say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. </FONT>
