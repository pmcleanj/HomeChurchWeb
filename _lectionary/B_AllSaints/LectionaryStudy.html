the right date. Pentecost tells the story of the Church. Over this
longest season of the church year, we will meditate on what it means
to be &ldquo;the Body of Christ&rdquo;, &ldquo;the whole company of
Christ's faithful people&rdquo;, &ldquo;His hands and feet in the
world&rdquo;. Here is our memory scripture for late Pentecost:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Grace
be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><I>Behold,

which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
of him. Even so, Amen.</I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Wisdom</B> </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Wisdom has been a book of the
church since the earliest times. For some Christians, it is part of
the Apocrypha (&quot;hidden books&quot;); for others, it is in the
Old Testament. Until this book was written (about 50 BC), the best
that could be hoped for when one died was to exist in some
inderterminate state. Wisdom tells us that being made in the image of
God includes sharing with him in immortality. Only the godly, the
ethical, will be granted eternal life; those who choose to deviate
from God's ways will be punished and will disappear into nothingness.

of Solomon 3:1-9</FONT></I></A> 
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>In the Hebrew Bible, life
simply ended with death (or at best, the dead merely existed in an
indeterminate state, separated from God), but during the first
century BC, some Jewish thinkers developed the notion of after-life.
Wisdom is in the Apocrypha or in the Old Testament: the Church has
used it since the earliest times, but the Jewish authorities rejected
it. It is quoted in the New Testament. The thinking is that, at the
Last Judgement, the just (or righteous) will join God and the angels
in heaven, but the unjust (or wicked) will be punished. 2:23-24 says:
&ldquo;... God created us for incorruption, and made us in the image
of his own eternity, but through the devil&rsquo;s envy death entered
the world, and those who belong to his company experience it&rdquo;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">But the &ldquo;righteous&rdquo;
(v. 1) are protected by God, and after death, they will not suffer.
To the wicked (&ldquo;foolish&rdquo;, v. 2), they seem to have simply
ceased to exist, to have been annihilated, but they are actually &ldquo;at
peace&rdquo; (v. 3), with God and the angelic court. It may appear
that they have been punished, but their certain hope in life and in
death is to live for ever. Then v. 5: the hardship they have suffered
in life is really </FONT></FONT><EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">discipline</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#993366">,
a process of testing by God and being found acceptable to him, and a
preparation for receiving &ldquo;great good&rdquo; from him. God&rsquo;s
testing (v. 6) is like refining gold: when the ore is heated, the
metal coalesces and the slag separates: a process of purification.
Isaiah 53, a</FONT></FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#993366"> <FONT SIZE=2>Servant
Song</FONT></FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#993366"> <FONT SIZE=2>(which we
believe tells of Christ) speaks of a &ldquo;lamb that is led to the
slaughter ... there was no deceit in his mouth&rdquo; and his life is
&ldquo;an offering for sin&rdquo;. This is the sense in which those
who have died are a &ldquo;sacrificial burnt offering&rdquo; (v. 6).
At the Last Judgement (&ldquo;In the time of their visitation&rdquo;,
v. 7) those who have died will triumph (shining and &ldquo;sparks&rdquo;
are images of triumph.) V. 8a summarizes Daniel 7:18-27; in the
context of Wisdom, it simply means that the just will rule over the
wicked (although many Jews took Daniel as saying that, in the
Messianic age, Israel, the just, would rule all other nations.) In
the age to come, &ldquo;the faithful&rdquo; (v. 9), &ldquo;those who
trust&rdquo; in God, will understand ultimate &ldquo;truth&rdquo;,
i.e. God, and will dwell in a loving relationship with him, because
of his freely-given gift of love (&ldquo;grace&rdquo;) to, and
forgiveness of (&ldquo;mercy&rdquo;) those he chooses.</FONT></FONT></P>

</I></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This book can be divided into
two (and possibly three) parts. Chapters 1 to 39 were written before
the exile, from about 740 BC to about 700 BC. These were difficult
times for the southern kingdom, Judah: a disastrous war was fought
with Syria; the Assyrians conquered Israel, the northern kingdom, in
723 BC, and threatened Judah. Isaiah saw the cause of these events as
social injustice, which he condemned, and against which he fought
valiantly. Chapters 40 to 66 were written during and after the Exile
in Babylon. They are filled with a message of trust and confident
hope that God will soon end the Exile. Some scholars consider that
Chapters 56 to 66 form a third part of the book, written after the
return to the Promised Land. These chapters speak of hope and
despair; they berate the people for their sin, for worshipping other
gods. Like <I>Second Isaiah</I>, this part speaks of the hope that
God will soon restore Jerusalem to its former glory and make a new
home for all peoples. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Chapter 24 begins with the
announcement of the destruction of the earth. There will be total
upheaval of the social order (24:2). God will then destroy the earth.
Most people will have broken the covenant with him, so he will cause
them to &ldquo;suffer for their guilt&rdquo; (24:6) and die. Only a
godly remnant will remain. The earth will be a gloomy place (24:7-13)
but then the survivors will praise God&rsquo;s name (24:14-16a). &ldquo;On
that day&rdquo; (24:21) God will imprison rebellious angels and the
kings of the earth for a long time and then punish them (24:22). &ldquo;...
the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem ...&rdquo;

one of the roots of all misery, our mortality, and he will remove the
collective shame of breaking the covenant. The remnant, the godly,
will acknowledge &ldquo;our God&rdquo; (25:9), for whom we have

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>On
October 18th, Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa during a
ceremony at the Vatican, a few days after celebrating his own 25th
anniversary as Pope. This was an intermediate step in the Roman
Catholic Church&rsquo;s process of declaring her a saint. The Roman
Catholic Church has a careful and intricate process for sainthood,
which usually takes a minimum of thirty years after the person&rsquo;s
death. However, in Mother Teresa&rsquo;s case, Pope John Paul is
&ldquo;fast-tracking&rdquo; her path to canonization as a saint. In
1999, two years after her death, he waived the customary five year
waiting period, allowing the official inquiry into her canonization
to begin immediately. As part of the process, the details of her life
are documented for the edification of future generations, and there
needs to be two miracles attributed to her intercession after her
death &ndash; one before her beatification, and one more before she
is finally canonized as a saint. <BR><BR>All this may sound a little
strange to Lutheran ears. For Roman Catholics, the word &ldquo;saint&rdquo;
is traditionally reserved for martyrs and for those who lived
exceptionally holy lives. Lutherans have a wider understanding of
sainthood, one that encompasses the living as well as the dead. In
the footsteps of Martin Luther, we connect sainthood with our
baptismal identity. Lutherans are inclined to think of all the
baptized as &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; rather than thinking of sainthood
as an honor bestowed only on an exemplary few. Yet, the careful
consideration shown by our Roman Catholic sisters and brothers in
declaring sainthood serves as a reminder for us that to be named a
&ldquo;saint&rdquo; in baptism is not something to be taken lightly.
It is a precious gift of God. Washed in the waters of baptism, we are
made saints, holy children of God, whose lives are now joined in the
death and resurrection of Christ. In the Small Catechism, Luther
describes the meaning of baptism for our daily living: &ldquo;It
means that our sinful self, with all its evil deeds and desires,
should be drowned through daily repentance; and that day after day a
new self should arise to live with God in righteousness and purity
forever.&rdquo; In the waters of baptism, we receive both an identity
and a calling. By the grace of God, you are a saint! As the sainted
children of God, we are called to lives of love and mercy, to
intercessory prayer on behalf of others, and to witness and service
in Christ&rsquo;s name. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Psalms is a collection of
collections. The psalms were written over many centuries, stretching
from the days of Solomon's temple (about 950 BC) to after the Exile
(about 350 BC.) Psalms are of five types: hymns of praise, laments,
thanksgiving psalms, royal psalms, and wisdom psalms. Within the

24</FONT></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This psalm is based on a
Canaanite myth which tells of the divine conquest of the unruly
forces of chaos. The psalmist has transformed it into a hymn of
praise to God, the victorious creator, followed by a liturgy on
entering the Temple. In question-and-answer form, it was probably
sung antiphonally, as the Ark was borne to the Temple. Vv. 1-2
acknowledge God as creator. V. 3 asks: who will be admitted to the
Temple? Vv. 4-6 give the answer: those who are pure, do not worship
false gods, and do not harm others with false oaths. They will be
blessed by God, with prosperity. In vv. 7-10, the pilgrims identify
God in terms traditionally associated with the Ark: he is &ldquo;King
of glory&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Lord of hosts&rdquo; (v. 10), the war
hero of Israel (v. 8b). The &ldquo;doors&rdquo; (v. 9) are those
between the outer court and the sanctuary of the Temple. Perhaps a
priest asks: &ldquo;Who is the King of glory?&rdquo; (v. 8) from
within, and the people answer from the court. (The &ldquo;heads&rdquo;,
v. 7, are the lintels of the doors.) God dwells in the sanctuary.</FONT></FONT></P>

language, its author urges Christians to keep faith in a period of
persecution. It is hard to understand because we do not know the

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>This book is &ldquo;the
revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:1) made known through John. It
is prophecy which reveals secrets of heaven and earth. Our reading is
from John&rsquo;s record of his vision of the end-times. He has told
of the destruction of the old city, Babylon (code name for Rome) and
of the old heaven and earth (20:11); the ungodly have been driven off
to punishment (20:15). Only the godly, a remnant, remain. Isaiah
65:17-25 and 66:22 predict that all creation will be renewed, freed
from imperfections and transformed by the glory of God.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=2>Now John sees the new creation.
The &ldquo;sea&rdquo; (21:1), a symbol of turbulence, unrest and

probably not made with bricks and mortar, &ldquo;holy&rdquo;, of
divine origin, beautiful and lovely as a &ldquo;bride&rdquo;.
(Marriage is a symbol of the intimate union between the exalted
Christ and the godly remnant. Some see the city as the church, set
apart for God&rsquo;s use in the world.)</FONT></FONT></P>

and pain &ndash; characteristics that made the old earth appear to be
enslaved to sin &ndash; will disappear (21:4). God, &ldquo;seated on
the throne&rdquo;, speaks in vv. 5-6: he will do everything described
in 21:1-4; he is sovereign over all that happens in human history.
(&ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Omega&rdquo; are the first and last

text from Revelation paints a picture of God&rsquo;s new day, when
God will make all things new (vs 5), including a new heaven and a new
earth (vs 1). All this comes as pure gift from God, coming down from
heaven, prepared and ready for God&rsquo;s people. Revelation echoes
the promise and hope of Isaiah, sharing in anticipation of the day
when God will destroy death, and wipe away the tears from our eyes.
This text expresses the hope that is ours in Christ. It is no
coincidence that writers of liturgy and hymnody have turned to the
book of Revelation to find words for us to sing in faith: &ldquo;Now
the feast and celebration, all of creation sings for joy to the God
of life and love and freedom; praise and glory forever more! .....For
God has come to dwell with us, to make us people of God; to make all
things new&rdquo; (The hymn of praise in the Marty Haugen liturgy
&ldquo;Now the Feast&rdquo;, also With One Voice 789). In response to
God&rsquo;s promises, we gather at the Lord&rsquo;s table to share in
the feast, joined in communion with all the saints, celebrating in
the banquet of redemption. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

has died. Martha has told Jesus that he would not have died had Jesus
been present, but that the Father will grant whatever Jesus asks.
Jesus has said to her: &ldquo;Your brother will rise again&rdquo; (v.
23), which she takes to refer to the general resurrection Jews
expected at the end of time. Jesus has answered: &ldquo;I am the
resurrection and the life&rdquo; (v. 25); even though a believer dies
physically, he or she will live on as a person. She has added: &ldquo;I

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
the death of Lazarus, both Martha and Mary say the same thing to
Jesus. &ldquo;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have
died&rdquo; (vs. 32, see also verse 21). They express their hope,
faith, and expectation that Jesus, had he so chosen, could have
prevented Lazarus&rsquo; death. That same expectation is expressed by
the bystanders at the grave in their disappointed lament. (vs 37).
It&rsquo;s not an unreasonable expectation, given that Jesus had
healed a man born blind (chapter 9) and had intentionally waited for
two days before heading to Bethany after he had heard that Lazarus
was sick (vs 5-6). But Jesus does not fall into the trap of acting
out of the desire to meet others&rsquo; expectations of him. Jesus
doesn&rsquo;t prevent Lazarus from dying. Being a friend of Jesus
does not exempt a person from facing death. Jesus weeps with Mary in
her grief (vs 33). Then Jesus calls Lazarus out of the grave. For
Lazarus, this is an act of sheer grace. Unwrapped from the fetters of
death, Lazarus is freed to live anew. God&rsquo;s answer to death is
not prevention, but resurrection. Jesus had told Martha, &ldquo;I am
the resurrection and the life&rdquo; (vs 25). In the raising of
Lazarus, Jesus demonstrates that he is the one in whom the dead have
life. The raising of Lazarus foreshadows Jesus&rsquo; own death and
resurrection. In John&rsquo;s gospel, the raising of Lazarus is the
