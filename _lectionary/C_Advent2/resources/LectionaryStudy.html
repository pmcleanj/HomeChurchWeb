<H4><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Acting With Justice and
Mercy</I></FONT></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The prophetic book of Baruch
was written to explain the Babylonian exile as God's judgement, to
praise the wisdom of God's Law, and to foretell the restoration of
Jerusalem. Today's passage is the final chapter of the book; it
speaks of hope in God's mercy and justice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>In 9:1-4, Baruch sees Jerusalem
as a poor person who is raised to royal status by God. The robe of
mourning and misery is the exile; the splendor of God's glory are
&quot;royal robes.&quot; [1] Notice that the exile infers distance
from God and the loss of God's reputation among the nations; Israel's
return means intimacy with God and an increase in God's reputation
(his glory) among foreigners.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>God's growing reputation is
imprinted upon a crown given to the person, Jerusalem. [2] God's
name, &quot;YHWH,&quot; is the focal point. As long as Jerusalem
holds close to God's name, the Lord will return the favor and
increase the reputation (the &quot;splendor&quot;) of Jerusalem. [3]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>How does Jerusalem remain close
to God's name? To act in justice (&quot;cloak of justice&quot; in 9:2
and &quot;the peace of justice&quot; in 9:4) so as to give true
worship (that is, free of corruption and full of compassion). Baruch
links worship and acts of justice in the face of a corrupt Temple
bureaucracy. In the author's eyes, a just society gave credence to
its worship. If Jerusalem was just, it's Temple (its &quot;mitre&quot;
or crown on the top of its highest mount) would make its God and
itself famous (increase its &quot;splendor&quot;).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>As the Temple would be a beacon
for God's glory (to be seen), it would also be viewing point for the
residence to coming worshipers, both Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
God's word (either the prophetic word, the Scriptures, or both) would
be the cause of return. [5-6] Even those who left in shame by the
conquering Babylonians will return like royalty; this reflects the
poor-rich schema of 9:1. [6] Even nature itself will &quot;bow down&quot;
and &quot;give shadow&quot; to the returning exiles in response to
God's command [7-8]. God commands the return of the exiles and the
restoration of Jerusalem; the results are the glory (reputation), the
mercy, and the justice of God. [9] All three are the same. And all
three challenge the people to imitate them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Even today, Christians give God
glory primarily through acts of justice and mercy. Witness is only
commentary on these acts. In the season of waiting, let us not forget
the less fortunate. Let us act with justice and mercy.</FONT></FONT></P>

this season? How have you helped the poor this season?</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The blessing from Paul&rsquo;s
letter to the Philippians was a poignant display of affection. While
Paul was in prison (at Ephesus in 55 A.D.?), he wrote to a community
he established and nurtured (see Acts 16:11-12). His language was
remarkable. The relationship he had with the community at Philippi
was based on a sense of shared mission. Paul called the community
&ldquo;co-partners&rdquo; in spreading the Gospel [1:5] both in God&rsquo;s
grace and in suffering [1:7]. (Many scholars hold this &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;
was based upon the continued generosity of the Philippians to Paul.)
When Paul remembered the community (especially in prayer), it was a
joy-filled memory. And he yearned to rejoin them at the earliest
moment, only if he could.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>We all have mentors. Paul was
the mentor to the communities he established. We have all had mentors
in faith. Do we appreciate those who nurtured our relationship with
God? Do we act as mentors to others?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Reflect on those who have
been your mentors. Who have you helped? Use this time to pray to God
in thanks for those who have served you and those you serve.</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><I>When was the last
time something that didn't make sense catch your attention? Did its
image have contradictory messages? How was that possible?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Humor and advertising have
something in common. Both rely on contradiction to make a point. The
humorist will take a commonly shared experience and will look at it
in a new way. Voila. The contradictory nature of the experience is
laid bare. Everyone laughs because they see the absurdity though the
eyes of the humorist.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Ditto, advertisements. Place
two contradictory images together, according to the logic of the
advertiser, and the public will stop to look. (Whether this works or
not is a matter of opinion. But look around. The logic is still in
effect).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>1-2 After
Tiberias Ceasar had ruled the Roman Empire for fifteen years, the
word of God came to John in the desert. During that time, Pontius
Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod led Galilee and his brother,
Phillip, led the area of Ituraea and Trachonitis. Lysanias led
Abilene. And, in Jerusalem, Annas first, then Caiaphas, were the
chief priests in the Temple.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>3 John traveled up and down
the Jordan river valley. Everywhere he went, he proclaimed, &quot;Get
baptized! This will show everyone you turned your hearts and lives
over to God, so he can forgive your sins!&quot; 4 This was just like
Isaiah the prophet wrote:</B></FONT></FONT></P>

	everyone will see God's salvation!&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Luke presented a contrary sign
as proof of God's activity: a cryer of news in the desert. A news
cryer was an urban activity. People gathered in the marketplace to
hear the news from the traveling cryer. But, the desert (literally,
deserted areas) was no place to announce news of import. Such a place
hid many dangers and traps. Only the hermit endured such environs.
Yet, the combination of the two images (cryer in the desert) recalled
the Exodus experience and the prophetic tradition. If there was a
place to hear news from God, it was the desert.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Literal Translation</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>1 In the fifteenth year of
the rule of Tiberias Caesar, Pontius Pilate ruling Judea as governor,
Herod ruling Galilee as tetrarch, his brother Phillip ruling the
regions of Ituraea and Trachonitis as tetrarch, and Lysanias ruling
Abilene as tetrarch, 2 in (the time of) the high priesthood (of)
Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came upon John, son of Zachariah,
in the desert.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:1 &quot;ruling . . . as
governor&quot; This is a single participle. Pilate was the governor
of Judea and Samaria, but not of the whole of Palestine.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;ruling . . . as tetrarch&quot;
This is a single participle. The notion of tetrarch (&quot;ruling one
quarter of a country&quot;) had lost its original meaning. A tetrarch
was the leader of a small regional area.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:2 &quot;in (the time of) the
high priesthood (of) Annas and Caiaphas&quot; Luke grouped the
tenures of Annas and Caiaphas into a single time frame.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Of all the evangelists, Luke
had the greatest concern for history. Beginning with the political
situation in the known world (i.e., the Roman Empire), Luke reduced
his focus from the general to the particular. Luke wanted to pinpoint
the person of John the Baptist. He also wanted to raise the
historical significance of John's activity. The word of God stirring
in the Jordan had the same (even greater) impact than anything the
Caesar did! Luke accomplished this feat by name dropping and with the
use of a single sentence.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>3 (John) went into entire
country around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of metanoia for (the
purpose of) the forgiveness of sins. 4 As it is written in the book
of sayings (from) Isaiah the prophet,</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>&quot;A voice crying out in
	the desert,</B></FONT></FONT></P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><B>'Prepare the way of the
	Lord<BR>make his paths straight.<BR>5 Every ravine will be
	filled,<BR>and every hill and mount will be leveled,<BR>and the
	crooked (areas) will be straight,<BR>and the rough into smooth
	ways,<BR>6 and all flesh will see the deliverance of God.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:3 &quot;He went into entire
country around the Jordan&quot; John preached up and down the Jordan
River valley.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;metanoia&quot; is loosely
&quot;repentance.&quot; The root word is &quot;nous,&quot; the organ
of feeling a reason centered in the heart. With the prefix &quot;meta,&quot;
the word meant change in heart and mind. In the context of the times
and John's preaching, the word also meant a radical change in
lifestyle.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:4 &quot;book of sayings&quot;
is the book of Isaiah in the Bible.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;A voice crying out in the
desert&quot; This is an emphatic statement. This verse quoted Isaiah
40:3-4. The prophet used the image of the town crier (or advance man)
announcing the coming of the king. Isaiah (and John the Baptist) used
the image to announce the coming Day of the Lord. The image urged the
people to prepare for the judgement day.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The desert reminded Jews of the
Exodus experience. The people under Moses encountered God in the
desert and depended upon him explicitly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:4-5 The image of straightened
roads, filled ravines, leveled mountains, and roads where none
existed before reminds us of the public works projects for the
benefit of a visiting dignitary. When a king would visit an area,
roads were cleared (branches were cut back along the roadside), ruts
were filled in, new roads were developed (ravines filled in and hills
leveled). The improvements meant to impress the visiting royalty and
provide for his (or her) traveling comfort.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>3:6 &quot;all flesh&quot; meant
&quot;every living person.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>After Luke justified the
activity of John as a historical event, he moved to justify the
activity in Jewish tradition (the reference to Isaiah 40:3-4). Even
though the Roman Empire condoned (and even legalized) anti-Semitism
when Luke wrote his gospel, the general populace still had great
esteem for the moral life of the Jews. While they might not
understand the Jewish mentality and its insistence on monotheism,
they did respect its stature as a religion with a tradition. In
ancient culture, tradition was paramount, for it represented lasting
values and lasting lifestyles.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Writing for a non-Jewish
audience, Luke appealed to that tradition. Possibly Luke knew the
young Christian movement needed the legitimacy of tradition. He might
have even reported the rhetoric of the Baptist movement that
Christians adopted as their own. No matter. Luke gave his audience
(and possible converts) a sense of place. The new movement fulfilled
that of the old. Followers of the Way were now God's people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>John received the word of God
to preach a baptism of metanoia that led to the forgiveness of sins.
In other words, John's baptism was symbolic. It represented a
reorientation on the part of the sinner toward God. But it did not
forgive sins in itself. The baptism looked forward to an act of
divine mercy at the last judgement. Somehow, some way, the repentant
sinner hoped God would wipe the slate clean as he or she stood before
the Son of Man in the Last Judgment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Even so, John's activity meant
to fulfil Isaiah's prophecy. A desert cryer called people to prepare
the way for the King of Kings. The road was to be made wide, made
smooth, and made new. The improvements made were internal as well as
external. The sinner was to reform in heart and deed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>Catechism Themes: John the
Baptist (CCC 717-720)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>For Christians, John the
Baptist represented Elijah, the desert prophet who was swept into
heaven on a fiery chariot. Since Elijah did not taste death, the
prophet, Jews believed, would return to herald the coming Messiah.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>John's prophetic message and
baptism revealed the work of God's Spirit. Like Elijah, John
ministered in the desert. Like Elijah, John challenged everyone to
moral change. Like Elijah, John had an audience of the poor and the
true seekers. If Elijah was the first of the prophets, John would be
the last. Their appearance, message, and effect created an
interesting symmetry to the era of prophets. John fit the image of
Elijah, but he did more than the ancient prophet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>John's ministry prepared for
the coming of the Christ. His followers would be open to the
preaching of the One anointed by the Spirit. His baptism of
repentance prefigured the sacrament of baptism. His death prefigured
the death of the Messiah. As the image of John pointed backward to
Elijah, it pointed forward to Jesus.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2><I>What strikes you most about
the figure of John the Baptist? His appearance, his preaching, or his
baptism? Why?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>John the Baptist was God's
advertisement. Rooted in the nation's past, his appearance in the
desert caught the popular imagination. His message prepared the
populace for the coming of One Greater. &quot;Get ready!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>The contrary sign of John
brought together historical significance and prophetic tradition. It
also revealed God's activity. God was about to do something new,
unique, different. John stood in the shadows of the past, but pointed
to future events.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=2>As the year ends, we, too, look
back to the past for comfort and reflection. But we look forward to
the coming of One Greater. Let us take the time to &quot;Get ready.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
