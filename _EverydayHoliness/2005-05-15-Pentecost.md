Pentecost
				commemorates the day Christ's disciples received the Holy Spirit.
				It's the third greatest celebration of the Christian year after
				Easter and Christmas, and is one of our four Baptismal Festivals.
				It's also a traditional day for Confirmations. Celebrate any
				Baptism or Confirmation anniversaries in your family by lighting
				Baptismal Candles, inviting Godparents to dinner, and serving
				special foods or a decorated cake. This is the time to put away
				Easter decorations and Easter customs, and return to the everyday
				work of being in Christ. At Pentecost, the focus of the Christian
				year shifts from the life of Christ to the life of the Church.
				Use the less hectic days of summer to re-examine your Rule of
				Life (as described in the Prayer Book), and bring your personal
				ministries into line with your baptismal covenant. If you don't
				have an intentional personal ministry, take one on.
