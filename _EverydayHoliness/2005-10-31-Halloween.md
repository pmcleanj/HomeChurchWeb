##October 31, 2005: All Saints Eve##

Commonly known as Hallowe'en. Like
				Walpurgisnacht and Midsummer's, Hallowe'en has Wiccan
				associations. The Calvinists failed to suppress its observance,
				but although we still observe it, it has become clearly
				non-Christian, or even anti-Christian. One Sunday School child,
				on learning that the first Baptismal promise is to renounce evil,
				said: "But what about Hallowe'en? I dressed up as a devil."
				Instead, read your children the Lives of the Saints, and help
				them dress up as Saints. Anne plans to go as Saint Elizabeth with
				her apron full of roses, or perhaps as Saint Martha with Rachel
				as her pet dragon.
