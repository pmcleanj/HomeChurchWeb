The
				secular Christmas is a one-day orgy of consumerism. But if we
				don't have everything ready by December 25, we have twelve more
				days to get it right. By spreading the holiday out until the eve
				of Epiphany, and reducing its intensity, you can mitigate both
				the pre-Christmas stress and the post-Christmas let-down.</SPAN></P>

					you didn't manage to visit.</SPAN></P>
