Use Holy Saturday to decorate your home.
				Hike and hunt for pussy-willows, or make paper crocusses, or buy
				lilies or force bulbs. Easter is the primary festival of the
				Christian year; more important than Christmas. Make it seem as
				special. If you made door-decorations for Lent, replace them on
				Holy Saturday. We made a Noah's Arc on a black background, with a
				rainbow that we added one colour to during each of the six weeks
				in Lent. On Holy Saturday, I'll replace the black background with
				a sky-blue one.
