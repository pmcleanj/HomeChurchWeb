#February 2: the Feast of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple##
				

As

				winter solstice and the vernal equinox -warmer climes consider
				this the first day of spring. The first signs of lengthening days
				are celebrated by a candlelight service on the eve, call
				"Candlemas". Decorate your door (or several interior
				doors) with symbols of doves and candles. Simple construction
				paper cut-outs, neatly glued together from different colours and
				replaced frequently, can be a subtle but persistent reminder of
				the sacred shape to our lives. If you can't attend a Candlemas
				service, just this once pray together as a family. Do it by
				candlelight, perhaps after watching the sun set. Or stage a
				family candle-light procession around the garden, inside and up
				to bed. Use the <A HREF="bcp.html#candlemass">Collect on page 266</A>
