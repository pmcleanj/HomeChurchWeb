This
				is the third "quarter day". Like May Day, it was
				supressed by the Calvinist church for its Wiccan associations.
				Midnight bonfires are a traditional celebration. For us, the fire
				is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. It reminds us of God going
				before the Israelites as a pillar of flame, on their trek through
				the wilderness. Read Exodus to your children by firelight. If you
				have re-committed to your Rule of Life, dedicate yourself to it
				by throwing into the flames a list of all the sins you are
				striving to leave behind. Saint John the Baptist Day is
				particularly special for Quebecois.
