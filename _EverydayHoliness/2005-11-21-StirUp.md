				<P>>##November 20, 2005: Stir-up Sunday##
				
				

>The old collect for this Sunday begins
				"Stir up, we beseech thee O God..." It's a good day for
				baking your Christmas Pudding and Christmas cake. Invite friends
				-- especially non-Christian friends, since this is a wonderful
				missionary opportunity -- to come and stir wishes into your cake.
				As the first person takes up the spoon to stir the wishes in,
				pray the collect from the prayer book.
