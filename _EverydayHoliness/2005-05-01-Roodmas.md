##May Day, (Saint Walpurga's Day, or the Feast of Saint Philip and Saint James.)##
				
				

May Day is traditionally celebrated with
				a picnic and Maypole dancing. The Calvinist branches of the
				church banned May Day because of itsWiccan associations. But its
				hard to ignore May Day as it is the second cross-quarter day and
				the start of Summer (I can never fathom why television and radio
				weathermen keep referring to June 22 as the start of Summer when
				its common name is Midsummer's Day!). Reclaim it for Christ by
				scheduling the first family barbecue or picnic of the year. Try a
				May pole, if you're brave, and use the liturgical colours (red,
				white, purple and green) for the ribbons. Or just use red and
				white ribbons in honour of the Saints whose day this is: Red
				commemorates martyred Saints, white unmartyred Saints.
