##November 1, 2005: All Saints Day##
				
				

All Saints Day commemorates all God's
				Faithful departed. Its proximity to Rememberence Day means that
				the two are often celebrated together in the Church. It is one of
				the four Baptismal festivals in the church. Celebrate the
				anniversaries of your family baptisms: 
				

Invite the god-parents or other family
				and friends to a special dinner. 
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Set the
				baptismal candle on the table, and remember those whose
				anniversary it is during grace or family prayers. The prayer for
				the newly baptised from the prayer book is appropriate here.
