##May 4-7, 2005: Rogation## 
				

>Our prayer book designates the Rogation
				Days as days of Solemn Prayer. Even if you don't normally hold
				family prayers, consider holding them on these days to ask God's
				blessing on farmers during the crucial time of planting. This
				year farmers in the Red River valley are in special need of our
				prayers. Commemorate your own Rogation by planting a tree or your
				vegetable garden. As you cover over your seeds, pray the collect
				for the Rogation Days from the prayer book
