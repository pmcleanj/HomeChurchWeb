				</P>
				<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">Saint
				Rachel's Day is special to us as our younger daughter's Name Day.
				Have a Name Day party. Use the prayers for a birthday from the
				prayer-book as your table grace, or the prayers for the
				commemoration of a Matron or Virgin.
