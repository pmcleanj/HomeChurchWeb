Since
the third day of creation, the sun and moon have ruled over day and
night, hours and seasons. But, if we are not careful, those
God-ordained seasons become lost amid the pressures of secular time.
We can if we choose let those seasons be lost amid the secular
pressures on our time. Or we can celebrate the seasons, in true
Anglican Tradition.

In
a discussion about Santa Claus, a parent told me, "I think my
child knows the real meaning of Christmas. I'm sure she gets that at
Sunday School." The fact is though, our children don't learn the
real meaning of our faith -- and our adults won't, either -- unless
they live it Monday through Saturday as well.

One
Easter Sunday morning, I stood outside the church crying "I
don't know where to go". Unwelcome there, it was too late to
attend any of the other services I knew about. It is, unfortunately,
inevitable that from time to time the institutional church lets us
down. And the institution is important enough that such let-downs
will massively disrupt spiritual lives, as ours have been disrupted.
It is at such times that the traditions and observances we have built
into our home lives carry us forward in union with Christ.
