##July 26,
				2005: The Feast of Saint Anne ##
				</P>
				<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">Saint
				Anne's Day is special to us as our elder daughter's Name Day.
				Other Anne's may be interested to know that the heritage site at
				Saint Anne's (a day-trip north of Calgary) has a special
				celebration on this day, and may be worth a trip. Or, just have a
				Name Day party. Use the prayers for a birthday from the
				prayer-book as your table grace, or the prayers for the
				commemoration of a Matron or Virgin.
