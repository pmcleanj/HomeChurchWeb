>Fast on Good Friday. While you're
				fasting, bake hot-cross buns with your family. The spices in the
				buns recall the spices the women brought to the tomb on Easter
				morning. Children (and those who aren't used to fasting) can
				break their fast on the warm buns as soon as they come out of the
				oven.</P>
