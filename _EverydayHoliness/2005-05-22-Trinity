<P>>##May 22, 2005: Trinity## 
				

>Trinity is the second Sunday in the
				Season of Pentecost. It marks the return to "ordinary time":
				a "growing" time for the Church. That's why its colour
				is green. The focus of Trinity is on the three-fold nature of the
				God we have been experiencing through the year so far: the Father
				Who gave us Jesus at Christmas; the Son Who redeemed us at
				Easter, and the Spirit Who redeemed us at Pentecost. Visit a
				Lutheran church like Saint Matthew's Bridgeland or Sharon
				(Crescent Heights) to see the beautiful Trinitarian symbols that
				characterise Lutheran iconography, and copy them to decorate your
				own doors.</P>
